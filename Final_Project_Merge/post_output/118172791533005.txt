Thanks so much for liking our page!
Many of you have expressed interest in how we chose our name. It is derived from the term flecking, also called tiger flecking. This is the pattern of tiny coffee particles on the top of an espresso shot. It can signify a good espresso extraction and proper grind. The finer details can make all the difference!, I want to give a big thank you from the Fleck team to everyone who's liked the page!
