If you're in the mood for some progressive bluegrass throw on Cornmeal @ http://www.cornmealinthekitchen.com Early Show @ Thunder Road Music Club & Restaurant Fri 9.18 - GET TIX: http://bit.ly/918CornmealTR, In the late 90's American filmmakers Zach Niles and Banker White encountered Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars in the Sembakounya Camp in Africa, and were so inspired by their story they ended up following them for three years as they moved from camp to camp, bringing much needed joy to fellow refugees with their heartfelt performances. This experience sparked the awe-inspiring documentary which would be released in the years to follow.  Eventually, the war in Sierra Leone came to an end, and over time the All Stars returned to Freetown, where they met other returning musicians who joined the band’s rotating membership. It was there in the tin-roofed shacks of Freetown’s ghettos that Sierra Leone’s Refugee All Stars recorded the tracks that ended up, along with unplugged recordings made in the refugee camps, being the basis for their debut album, Living Like a Refugee, which was released on the label Anti in 2006.
