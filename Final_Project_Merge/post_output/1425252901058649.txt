Get your tickets while you can!, Two mermaids, both alike in dignity, In fair Beverly, where we lay our scene.

Found (unintentional?) comedy at Atomic Cafe [Coffee Roasters] in Beverly. Notice the two mermaid tap handles on either side of the photo. Essentially mirror images of each other... both with long flowing hair and arms over their heads in a helpless or immodest pose; tails wrapped around the tap handle. The irony is that these beers are from two rival islands right next to each other. The handle on the left is, I believe, Bad Martha Beer from Martha's Vineyard. The handle on the right is definitely Grey Lady from Cisco Brewers Nantucket. I think the Bad Martha mermaid wins in one category I'm not able to talk about in this forum...

Two nemeses that might not realize how similar they are??

Interesting The Boston Globe article about Cisco's distribution decisions...

Phantom Gourmet: http://www.phantomgourmet.com/restaurant/ma-salem-bambolina, Wine ice luge. What? Keep reading for details.

Hey you guys! We are busy planning some fun entertainment for our G.O.A.T. Pig Roast & Block party in February and it's shaping up to be EPIC.

Recently added: Wine ice luge! Yeah...you read that right. Ice luge. For wine. We will also feature some street performers and pi√±atas to get things started... And don't forget that Notch Brewing will be there pouring their refreshing brews...and if Notch is there, it's always a good time. You know how they roll.

G.O.A.T., by the way, stands for Greatest Of All Time. But... coincidentally, we're also roasting both a pig and a goat. Everyone knows that pig is tasty but goat is surprisingly mild and delicious as well!

Thank you to our customers and staff for making it a fantastic 6 months.  2016 is going to be even better!, Dear Bambolina Patrons: 

You may have read a short piece in the Boston Globe recently (link below) about some sort of secret restaurant called Back Alley Pigs or Back Alley Bacon or some such nonsense. We want to assure you that, as far as we know, it doesn't exist. There is no chef who serves tasty meals in the alley...there is no giant, pig-masked superfan... There is no red lantern that signals the arrival of pork deliciousness Wednesday nights. We aren't sure what's going on, but we can promise you that we'll get to the bottom of it. This may have something to do with those people who didn't want us to throw our block party on Liberty St (Tix still available).

There's quite a bit of mysterious activity happening; even for Salem!

Pierre is credited with saving French vineyards from total destruction in the mid-19th century at the hands of a pest called Phylloxera.

Keith, a Salem resident, is an esteemed Pizzaiolo (pizza maker) and has been with us nearly since the beginning. When it came time to freshen our dessert menu for the fall season, Keith suggested an apple cake recipe that he'd been tinkering with at home. After experimenting with buttermilk and other ingredients for the cake, Keith finally settled on sour cream as the perfect ingredient to bring the apple cake to life and to highlight the flavors and textures that he'd been seeking. Although someday Keith hopes to open his own Italian Bakery, for now he slings pies and develops recipes at Bambolina. You can taste the product of Keith's labors in Bambolina's 'Roasted Apple' dessert where Keith's cake serves as the anchor.
