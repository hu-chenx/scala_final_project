List(Dear friends and valued customers, 

With heavy hearts, we’d like to share with you that Sam’s will remain closed. We had hoped to reopen this beloved restaurant on the waterfront this year, but despite everyone’s best efforts the process became too overwhelming for our small, family-driven team. We can’t thank you enough for the support you’ve shown us over the past several years and the memories we’ve created at Sam’s together. On the bright side, we have opened The Maiden in South Boston with the same team you got to know and love through Sam’s. We would be thrilled to see each and every one of you there! Thank you again for helping make Sam’s the hidden gem that it was, and we hope to see you soon.

Much love, 

Esti, Drew, Jon and The Maiden family, #TBT When Paul, our sous chef at the time, tried to complete the Cinnamon Challenge.  He didn't make the time limit but he (barely) got it down. We might need to rehash this at The Maiden., Can you believe our sister restaurant, The Maiden, has been open for two months now? Swing on by for a board like the one below and much, much more!, The wait for Sam's to reopen just got easier. Our sister restaurant The Maiden is now open in South Boston!

What's the greatest love song of all time?

It would be too hard to come to a consensus between all of us here at Sam's, so I (Jon) will just tell you my thoughts on the matter.  There are obviously a ton of songs to choose from and being that I dig a wide variety of styles makes it even harder (the Beatles alone could fill a top 10, not to mention old Sinatra tunes from his days with Tommy Dorsey or a myriad of songs from Elvis Costello's career or the pop rock ballads of Big Star . . . seriously, I could go on and on).  But when I think hard about it, I always come back to the musical masterpiece that is "As" by Stevie Wonder.  If you've never heard it, give 'er a quick listen:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWhMyOs0pCQ

Besides having a great structure both lyrically and instrumentally, it invokes all the intensity that love, in any of its forms, can bring about.  Not to mention it's Stevie . . . you can't match that dude's vibrance.

Enough about me, what's your pick?  The winner will receive a Facebook post or tweet a day from us complimenting you on how lovely you are . . ., A quick look at our bees after they were moved into the hives!, Esti's a beekeeper! A quick video of her 20,000 bees arriving at their new home, Roasted beet terrine with pistachios, sesame candied walnuts and herbed goat cheese., This week's QotW:

What do you love about Boston?

Sure, it's a blanket question, but we're sure it's one that has been on most people's minds lately.  For us it's the impeccable way this lovely little city melds innovation and tradition seamlessly.  Even though we are located in one of the newer developments, everything still feels uniquely Bostonian.  Sure, there's other cities on the East coast that have remnants of their colonial past still intact, but none so integrated as The Hub.  Beyond architecture, this dichotomy seems to persist in both the culture and its people.  It's pretty beautiful, and in our personal opinion, quite unique.

So what about Boston pulls at your heartstrings and leaves you all warm and fuzzy?

This week's winner will have their sentiments conceptualized in a chalk mural dedicated to our fair Olde Towne., Congrats to Rick Parsons for winning this past week's QotW when he casted Michael Caine to play the title role in his personal biopic!

Pig with Lipstick:

Bacon-washed Amber Rum with Pamplemousse Rose, Lemon Juice and Raspberry Purée., This week's QotW:

If there were to be a movie or sitcom made about your life, who would you want cast in the starring role?

For us, Esti's actress is a no brainer:  Anjelica Houston all the way (just not in her current form *shudder*).  Jon & Drew are a bit tougher . . . Do you go with two actors that look alike, say younger versions of Gary Busey & Nick Nolte?  Not the most flattering, but definitely entertaining.  Jon used to get Matthew Modine a lot when he was younger, so there's that.  Drew's mannerism and humor are akin to Patton Oswalt's, though the proportions are quite different, to say the least.  Speaking of different proportions, what if we were to do a wacky sitcom and cast Warwick Davis and Peter Dinklage, respectively?  So many choices . . .

The winner of this week's QotW will have an awesome* mock-up promo poster of their show/movie made and proudly displayed on our page.

So fresh and so clean clean!, This week's QotW:

What get's your goat?

Figured the winning answer to last week's question, "Trouble: Goat Edition," made for an excellent segue to this question.  So what makes you angry enough to do more than just roll your eyes but not enough to go completely ballistic?  For us, it's people who make multiple reservations at different restaurants and forget or neglect to cancel them.  Especially if we had to deny another customer the table that we were holding for the no-show-ers.  

The winner this week will have a special drink made in their honor using some of their favorite ingredients which we'll feature as an addition next week.  That way, even when all your goats are gotten, you'll have something to take a bit of the edge off.

Cheers!, Spring has sprung ! Spring pea , Easter egg radish, and salsify salad on tonight's menu, null, Tonight's addition: tarragon-truffled mac & cheese with asparagus and melted raclette.  Need moar?  Add ham or crab and make it go to 11!, This week's QotW: What's your theme song?

We're having a difficult time figuring out what Sam's would be . . . Is it the theme from "Endless Summer?"  Or maybe "Brandy" by Looking Glass?   Or "Blue Day" by American Hi-fi (coughselfpromotioncough)?  So many choices.

I think we'll go with "Brandy" as after we're just a down-to-earth harbor girl waiting for her true love to return (spoiler: he doesn't).

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep7FWnbAaCI, After sorting through all four entries, we've finally determined a winner for the QotW: Grats to Adrienne Darrow!  Know that we at House Sam's are your sworn bannermen.

We'll be back in an hour or so with this week's question., Tonight's Addition: Crispy Fried Catfish with stuffed razor clams, cabbage slaw & pickled pepper remoulade., Kitchen getting their ducks all in a ...something ..something..something, In honor of the Season 3 premier of Game of Thrones, we've decided to tailor the Question of teh Week to it!

This week's QotW: What would be your house's sigil and/or words?

The winner will have their house's sigil/words adorned on our chalkboard wall.

To get the ball rolling: our words are "Summer is Coming" with the sigil being two golden retrievers flanking a devil dog on a turquoise field.

repost becuz i spel gud!, It was difficult deciding who should be deemed the winner of last week's QotW, but in the end we had to go with Cheri Clarkin's choice of Shaun Cassidy, partly because we we're curious about her supposed "sprouting," but mainly because this picture I found of him reminds me of when General Zod and his disciples are trapped at the end of Superman II.

Grats, Cheri, we'll be touting your virtues on Facebook and Twitter all week :)
