http://diethood.com/lemon-chicken-fettuccine/, Simply in LOVE with Fox Point Pickles AND their dips and Hummus...Try this recipe - You won't be disappointed!

Spicy Fox Point Pickled Hummus

 

1 24.7-oz. jar of Fox Point Pickling Company Spicy Dill Pickles

1 15-oz. can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed

¼ cup tahini

2 tbsp. olive oil

½ tsp. kosher salt

½ tsp. ground cumin

½ tsp. dill weed

Paprika for garnish (optional)

 

Strain ¼ cup of pickle brine (to remove the whole spices) from the jar of Spicy Dill Pickles into the bowl of a food processor, and combine with the tahini.  Turn on and process for 30 seconds, then stop and scrape down the sides with a spatula, and then process for another 30 seconds.

 

Remove the cloves of garlic from the jar of pickles and mince them, as well as 4 Spicy Dill Pickle spears.  Add the minced garlic and ¾ cup chopped pickles along with the cumin, kosher salt, dill weed and olive oil to the tahini mixture. (you can also add the habanero pepper from the jar of pickles if you like it extra hot!)  Process everything for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides, and then process for 30 more seconds.

 

Add the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and process for another minute, until the hummus is thick and smooth.  If the hummus is too thick (as it likely will be), slowly add 2 tbsp. of water to the mixture while to food processor is turned on until it reaches your desired consistency.

 

(Optional) Drizzle some olive oil over the hummus and sprinkle with paprika.  Garnish with the remaining chopped pickle.  

 

Serve with your favorite raw vegetables or pita bread., null, A warm pan of Oatmeal Raisin rolls is always good!  Its the cinnamon that gets me everytime!

Almond Crusted Chicken with flavorful Popchips!

Almond-Crusted Chicken Breasts 
Crusted with cheddar potato popchips for added flavor
Ingredients:
½ cup unsalted almonds, toasted
½ cup of cheddar potato popchips
·	2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
·	¾ teaspoon grated lemon zest
·	1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
·	¾ teaspoon dried rosemary
·	1 garlic clove
·	¼ teaspoon salt
·	4-to-5 ounce boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
Procedure:
·	Preheat oven to 425 degrees F
·	In the work bowl of a food processor, place the almonds, popchips, olive oil, lemon zest and juice, rosemary, garlic, and salt.  Process until coarsely chopped; the mixture will be a thick paste.
·	Arrange the chicken breast halves in a baking dish. Divide the almond paste and spread on the breasts; pat down to cover each breast completely.
·	Roast in the oven until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer reads 165 deg F to 170 deg F, about 10 minutes. Loosely tent with foil and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before serving., Perfect day for pot roast mushroom soup

http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/01/sugar-biscuits/, Trout with fresh lemon and capers!
2 (4-ounce) trout fillets, skin attached
.25 teaspoon(s) salt
.125 teaspoon(s) fresh-ground pepper
2 tablespoon(s) unsalted butter
1 tablespoon(s) olive oil
1 tablespoon(s) lemon juice
2 teaspoon(s) chopped parsley
.5 teaspoon(s) whole capers
1 (small lemon) peeled and segmented

Score 2 crosswise slits (skin deep only) into each trout fillet using a very sharp knife. Turn the fillets over and season the flesh with the salt and pepper.
Heat 1/2 tablespoon butter and the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place the fillets in the nonstick skillet, skin side up, and cook until golden brown -- about 3 minutes.
Flip and continue to cook until cooked through and the skin begins to crisp around the edges -- about 2 more minutes. Transfer the fillets to a serving dish and keep warm. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter to the hot skillet and cook until just brown.
Immediately stir in the lemon juice, parsley, capers, and lemon segments. Pour the sauce over the fillets and serve immediately., Save the Date!  Come meet some folks that make Little Rhody unique!

serves 2 generously
4 slices sandwich bread (oat bread works well!)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/3 cup half and half
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup honey roasted peanut butter 
2 ripe bananas, thinly sliced
butter for greasing your ramekins
Turbinado brown sugar for broiling (optional)

Roughly cut the bread into 1–inch pieces and set aside.
In a large, shallow dish, whisk together the eggs, vanilla, half and half and salt. Heat the peanut butter in the microwave until soft—this took my microwave about 30 seconds. Stir the peanut butter into the egg mixture and mix until it's as even as possible (but it's okay to have a few peanut butter blobs).
Gently stir the bread into the egg-peanut butter mixture, tossing until evenly coated and absorbing the mixture. The bread will disintegrate a little, but that's fine. Slice the bananas and stir them gently in. Lightly grease two 6–inch wide ramekins (or use 4 smaller ramekins). Pour the pudding mixture into the ramekins and pat down gently. Cover in saran wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to allow flavors to fully meld.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Sprinkle a little Turbinado sugar on tops of puddings. Bake for about 20 minutes, until top is golden and the pudding has puffed slightly.

1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 large eggs
1 1/4 cups whole milk
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 ripe bananas, sliced
Directions: 

In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together all your dry ingredients
In a separate bowl, whisk together all of the wet ingredients until the egg is broken up.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and add the sliced bananas. Gently stir until you stop seeing flour. Be careful not to overmix, that will make the batter tough. Leave a few lumps for tender pancakes.
Place your a large non-stick pan over a medium-high flame and let the surface get hot. It's hot enough when you sprinkle a few droplets of water over the surface and they evaporate.
Moisten a paper towel with vegetable oil and lightly wipe the bottom of the pan. This will keep the pancakes from sticking.
For each pancake, gently pour 1/2 cup of batter into the pan, using a ladle or a measuring cup. Use the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a circle.
Bubbles will form in the batter. When they begin to pop, the pancakes are ready to be flipped.

Apple Breakfast Puffs
adapted by Pioneer Woman

3 cups AP flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup sugar
2/3 cup shortening (Crisco)
2 eggs
1 cup milk (I used buttermilk)
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 teaspoons cinnamon
2 sticks butter
1 apple (peeled, cored, and diced into small cubes)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease 12 muffin cups. Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Whisk mixture, and set aside.

In a different bowl cream together sugar and shortening, then add eggs and mix. Add flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to creamed mixture, beating (until the flour is mostly incorporated) after each addition and ending with the flour. Fold in chopped apples. (Make sure you do not overmix so that the puffs do not come out tough.)

Fill prepared muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes or until golden. In a bowl, melt 1 1/2 sticks butter. In a separate bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Dip baked muffins in butter, coating thoroughly, then coat with cinnamon-sugar mixture., Forget Hot Chocolate...try Hot Vanilla!, Not sure what to do with ll those apples? Try crockpot apple butter!

serves 2 to 4
INGREDIENTS
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 large cloves garlic, very thinly sliced
Sea salt
Pinch of red pepper flakes
4 large roasted bell peppers, from a jar
PROCEDURE
Place the olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes into a small stone baking dish, pretty enough to serve the dish in.  Stir everything together.  Place the dish on a rimmed baking sheet, and into a preheated 425°F oven for 10 minutes.  The garlic will just be starting to toast and the oil will be bubbling hot.
While the garlic is in the oven, slice the red peppers into strips.  Once the garlic and olive oil comes out of the oven, stand back and gently place the peppers into the hot oil.  They will stop the garlic from burning, and the hot oil will warm and flavor the peppers.  Serve with tons of bread!

Can't wait to try this... So many fun, unique squashes available this time of year!

Ingredients
2 medium delicata squash, halved and seeded
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 oz Italian style turkey sausage
1/2 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
pinch nutmeg
pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 bunch kale, coarsely chopped (about 2 heaping cups)
1 tablespoon cooking sherry
2 tablespoons chicken stock or water
1/4 cup grated jarlsberg or other swiss cheese
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup breadcrumbs (optional
To Prepare Squash:

Preheat oven to 375F degrees. Place halved and seeded squash on a baking sheet and drizzle with a touch of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in a preheated oven for 25 minutes. While squash is roasting, prepare filling. In a medium saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add turkey sausage and onion, cooking until sausage is cooked through and onions are soft about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more. Stir sage, nutmeg, cayenne, salt and pepper into the sausage mixture. Add chopped kale, sherry, and water. Give a good stir and then cover pan with a lid for 3-5 minutes, stirring a few times, until kale is starting to wilt and most of the moisture has evaporated. Remove filling from the stove and let cool 10 minutes. Lastly stir in both cheese and taste, adjusting seasoning if necessary. Split the mixture among the 4 divided squash and top with a tablespoon of breadcrumbs if desired. Bake at 375 for 20 minutes until filling is heated through and squash is completely cooked.

Fruit bowls served in jack o'lantern oranges!!, Hot and flavorful Beef Stew made with beer and paprika... From the Pioneer Woman 
3 Tablespoons Olive Oil
1 Tablespoon Butter
2 pounds Stew Meat
1 whole Medium Onion, Diced
3 cloves Garlic, Minced
1 can Beer, 12 Ounce Can
4 cups Beef Stock (or 4 Cups Water + 4 Beef Bouillon Cubes)
2 cups Water (additional, If Needed)
1 Tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
2 Tablespoons Tomato Paste
1/2 teaspoon Paprika
1/2 teaspoon Kosher Salt
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1-1/2 teaspoon Sugar
4 whole Carrots, Washed, Unpeeled, And Roughly Sliced
4 whole New Potatoes, Quartered
Minced Parsley (optional)
Preparation Instructions
Heat oil and butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Brown meat in two batches, setting aside on a plate when brown. Cut pieces in half. Set aside.
Add diced onions to the pot. Stir and cook for two or three minutes until softened, then add garlic for another minute. Pour in beer and beef stock, then add Worcestershire, tomato paste, paprika, salt, pepper, and sugar. Add beef back into the pot. Stir to combine. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Add carrots and potatoes, then cover and cook for an additional 30 minutes. (If stew gets dry, just add a cup of hot water at a time to replenish the liquid.) Taste and adjust seasonings as needed., Quick, easy and delicious! Breakfast hash..

Non-stick cooking spray
1 cup frozen shredded potatoes or "hash browns" (you could also grate your own)
1-2 slices of sweet onion chopped
1/4 cup chopped bacon
about 1/4of a red bell pepper chopped
1 handful of baby spinach leaves chopped
1 egg beaten
Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Spray with cooking spray and add the frozen potatoes. Leave them alone while you chop all the other ingredients for at least 5 minutes before you flip. This will defrost and start to brown the potatoes.
Once they begin to brown cook for about another 3 minutes before adding the onion and bacon bits. We aren’t using any oil so they will not brown like traditional Hash Browns.
Once the onion and bacon  are added continue to cook over medium heat until the onion softens. Add the bell pepper. Cook for a few minutes allowing the flavors to merge.
Add the chopped spinach and stir in. As soon as it starts to wilt, pour in the beaten egg. Immediately start to combine and mix in the egg. Let the egg coat everything and cook through., Roasted pork loin with apple cider ! Smells wonderful!
(Adapted from Anne Burrell recipe)
1 4-5 lb Berkshire Boneless Pork Loin
2 large onions, sliced
1 thyme
3 Bay leaves
1 quart apple cider
4 springs rosemary leaves (roughly chopped)
9 Sage leaves (roughly chopped)
2-3 cloves of garlic (roughly chopped)
Salt and Pepper
Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
In your food processor, combine the rosemary, sage, garlic, salt and pepper and olive oil to make a paste.  Put the paste on the outside of the boneless roast.
Put the onions into the roasting pan and toss with olive oil. Add the thyme, bay leaves and 2 cups of the apple cider.  Roast the pork at 425 degrees for 20 minutes or until a beautiful brown crust has formed. Stir the onion and check that the cider has not evaporated.  You can always add apple cider if necessary.
Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and roast for 30 minutes or until your meat thermometer reads 150 degrees.  Let the pork roast rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.

Ingredients for the Cake bun:
4 eggs

2 oz. melted butter
Directions:
Slice the fruit of your choice in moon-like shapes, add lemon juice and toss once or twice. Set aside until needed.
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan combine water with sugar, bring to boil, stirring with a spoon until sugar dissolves. Leave the mixture to simmer without stirring or disturbing for about 5-8 minutes, until syrup turns amber color. Then remove from heat and add melted butter. At first, the butter will bubble up, then the whole mass will become like a thick caramel. You should be very careful during this process. DO NOT keep stirring the caramel, it will turn rock-hard on you. As soon as you add the butter, give it one stir and transfer the caramel into a designated, well-buttered 8″ baking dish or a springform pan.

Ingredients
For the base:
5 cups cubed Italian bread
4 whole eggs
1 1/4 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Pinch salt
1 mango, cubed
For the topping:
1/4 cup whole oats, ground to a flour in a food processor (yielding 1/2 cup oat flour)
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons neutral oil
Grease an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with oil. Distribute the bread cubes in the pan–they should go about halfway up, or a little more.
Mix together the eggs, almond milk, oil, sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt. Pour evenly over bread. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and foil and refrigerate overnight.
In a mini food processor, combine the oats, almonds, and sugar. Grind until they’re very fine. Add the flour, cinnamon, and salt, and process to combine. Drizzle in the oil 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture comes together. Store in a covered container overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Remove the pan from the fridge and arrange the mango cubes evenly over the top. Sprinkle the crumb mixture in large chunks over the top. Bake 45-50 minutes, until the top is golden and the pudding is brown around the edges and cooked through., So creative and fun!!!

1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
1/4 cup plus 6 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
3 large egg whites
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
Lemon wedges

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Dissolve 1/4 cup salt in 1 quart water in medium container or gallon-sized zipper-lock bag. Submerge chops, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 30 minutes. Rinse chops under cold water and dry thoroughly with paper towels.
 Transfer crumbs to rimmed baking sheet and add shallot, garlic, oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Toss until crumbs are evenly coated with oil. Bake until deep golden brown and dry, about 15 minutes, stirring twice during baking time. (Do not turn off oven.) Cool to room temperature. Toss crumbs with Parmesan, thyme, and parsley.
Place 1/4 cup flour in pie plate. In second pie plate, whisk egg whites and mustard until combined; add remaining 6 tablespoons flour and whisk until almost smooth, with pea-sized lumps remaining.
Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees. Spray wire rack with nonstick cooking spray and place in rimmed baking sheet. Season chops with pepper. Dredge 1 pork chop in flour; shake off excess. Using tongs, coat with egg mixture; let excess drip off. Coat all sides of chop with bread crumb mixture, pressing gently so that thick layer of crumbs adheres to chop. Transfer breaded chop to wire rack. Repeat with remaining 3 chops.

Blacked Beer-Brined Grilled Chicken
Serves 4 to 6
2 cups apple cider
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup kosher salt
1 cinnamon stick
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon whole peppercorns
1 teaspoon whole cloves
4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
2 12-ounce bottles dark or amber beer
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon cayenne (optional)

Combine the cider, sugar, salt, cinnamon, bay leaf, peppercorns, and cloves in a sauce pan over medium heat. Stir just until sugar and salt are dissolved. Remove from heat and let to cool to room temperature.

Lay the chicken breasts, skin-side down, in a shallow glass or ceramic (not metal) baking dish. Stir the beer into the cider mixture, then pour over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate the chicken for 4 to 8 hours.

When ready to grill, heat a gas or charcoal grill to to high heat (about 450-degrees). Meanwhile, transfer the chicken from the brine to a clean plate and let it rest, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes to take the chill off. Melt butter and stir in chili powder and cayenne.

Brush half the chili butter over the skin on each chicken breast and lay the breasts skin-side down on the grill. Cover and let cook undisturbed for 15 minutes. Flip the chicken breasts, taking care not to tear the skin, and brush with the remaining chili butter.

Cover and cook for another 10 minutes. Check the chicken for doneness, and if necessary, continue cooking in 5 minute increments until it has finished cooking. The chicken is done when the interior reaches 165°F, its juices run clear, and the inside is no longer pink.

Tend the chicken breasts with aluminum foil and let them rest 10 minutes before carving. The bones should pull away cleanly from the underside of the breasts with a little pressure. Slice the breasts into thin pieces and serve., Fireworks schedule for Rhode Island!

Cream Cheese Filling
adapted from David Lebovitz's Black Bottom Cupcake recipe 

(If you're using a standard tart pan, you can probably get away with halving this recipe.)

2 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature
2/3 cup sugar
2 eggs, room temperature

1. Beat the cream cheese in an electric mixer with the paddle attachment until smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes.

2. Add the eggs and sugar, beating well until creamy. Store in the refrigerator until ready for use.

You will also need:
Approximately 1 1/2 pounds of nectarines (4-6)
1/4 cup sugar (I used vanilla sugar)
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1 egg, beaten (to use as an egg wash)
Assembling the tart:
1. Slice about 5-6 nectarines as thick or thin as you'd like (I cut each half into 4 slices).
2. Roll out your tart dough and fit into your tart pan.

3. Pour your cream cheese mixture into your tart crust. I used a very deep dish tart pan that took almost all my cream cheese mixture. If you're using a standard tart pan, you will have a lot of the cream cheese mixture left over.

4. Arrange your nectarine slices however you wish and brush the edges of your tart dough with the egg wash. Sprinkle the top of your tart and crust edge with 1/4 cup of sugar.

6. Bake at 375 F for approximately 45 minutes, or until the center is no longer jiggly. During the last 10 minutes of baking, sprinkle the top with the 1/4 cup of sliced almonds., Will this be at YOUR fourth of July BBQ? Beer battered pickles from southern living...

Ready to grill and eat.., null, null, Perfect day for swordfish skewers!, It’s a classic, banana nut muffin with a little healthy whole-wheat flour for its texture and nutty flavor.

Banana Nut Muffins

Preheat the oven to 375F. Coat a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray or line with paper cupcake liners. In a medium bowl, whisk together:
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts (optional)
In a large bowl, stir with a whisk or beat with an electric mixer until well combined:

3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1/3 cup canola oil or melted butter
2 eggs
1 1/3 cups mashed very ripe bananas (2 to 3)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Stir the flour mixture into the banana mixture until just combined. Do not over mix; the batter shouldn’t be smooth. Divide the batter equally among the muffin cups. I like to use an ice cream scoop for this.

Bake until the muffins are lightly browned and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center, usually about 18 to 20 minutes.

Cool the muffins in the pan for a few minutes and serve warm or remove them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.

Makes 12 banana nut muffins.

Note: This banana nut muffin recipe can be made into banana nut bread. Just pour the batter into a greased and floured 8 1/2×4 1/2-inch loaf pan and bake at 350F for about 55 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. If you are using a glass loaf pan, lower the temperature to 325F and bake about ten minutes less since glass is a better heat conductor than metal and the bread will bake faster.

2 slices bread
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
6 ounces dry elbow macaroni, cooked and drained
1/4 cup minced onion
1/4 cup minced celery
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup white wine
2 cups chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cups whole milk
2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, grated (I like Cabot)
1/4 cup flour
Directions

1. Make bread crumbs: Put bread in food processor and process until you have coarse crumbs. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium frying pan and saute crumbs until golden and crisp, 5-7 minutes. Cool and then stir in chopped parsley. Set aside.
2. Saute onion and celery in a large saucepan with 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat until soft, about 3-5 minutes.
3. Ad flour to saucepan and stir for 1 minutes. Pour in wine and simmer for another 2 minutes.
4. Add broth and pepper and simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened. Whisk in milk and simmer for another 2-3 minutes until hot. Do not boil.
5. Add the cheese by handfuls, stirring after each handful until all the cheese is melted and the soup is smooth. Stir in the macaroni and simmer until the macaroni is warmed through.
6. Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with a generous handful of breadcrumbs. Serve at once., Try them! Straight from Pillsbury
