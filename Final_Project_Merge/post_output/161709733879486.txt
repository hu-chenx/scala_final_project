- George Washington
August 27, 1776

On a warm summer morning in a field at Long Island, New York General George Washington spoke those words to an anxious group of young men gathered there to defend an idea.

Their belief in a free nation where the rights of a citizen were bestowed upon them by God and not by a king was radical at the time, but one worth fighting for, and, if necessary, dying for.

General Washington could not have had any idea at the time how true his words would become.

With the outcome of the struggle gravely in doubt, brave young men summoned the courage to lay upon the altar of freedom their life, their liberty and their fortune. Included among those early patriots were the boys from Waltham.

As our Nation pauses to honor those who gave the last full measure of devotion in defense of our liberty we owe a special debt of gratitude to every generation of veterans, but especially to those who never made it back to neighborhoods across our city.

As you read their names, please remember that they were the kids that we see today on School Street, and on Lake Street, and on Hall Street, and on Main Street, and on Prentice Street and along Moody Street.

Remember that each of these kids had a unique voice and a hair color and a talent and a fault and a wit and a way of walking and a family left with a deep hole made by their passing.

During an interview for the finale of the highly acclaimed series 'Band of Brothers', based upon the Stephen Ambrose book of the same title, the leader of that band of brothers, Dick Winters, spoke of a grandchild who asked, "Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?". His reply, softly spoken and through misty eyes, remembering his lost comrades, "No . . . but I served in a company of heroes".

If your child ever needs to write a report about a genuine American hero, there are more than three-hundred stories to choose from right here in Waltham.

These boys from Waltham left home for the last time never to see another ball game or to open a Christmas gift or to blow out birthday candles or to see their children grow. They met the tides of history and of circumstance with courage, devotion and selfless determination.

Remember them and pray for them. Pray also for their beloved families who paid a terrible price in handing their souls over to eternity and pray that the cause for which they gave their lives will never be forsaken.

Prep Time: 20 minutes
Total Time: 20 minutes
Ingredients:

    1 cup of milk
    1/2 teaspoon vanilla
    1/2 cups sugar
    CLEAN Snow

Preparation:
Put on your warm clothes and take the kids outside to collect 4 - 5 cups of fresh, clean snow. Don't pack the snow, just scoop it up. Bring it in the house and set it in the freezer while you prepare the other ingredients.

Mix together the milk, vanilla, and the sugar. Stir this mixture until the sugar is dissolved. Slowly add the snow to your mixture, stirring constantly, until it is as thick as ice cream. Now it is ready to east and enjoy., Dear February,

Welcome to Waltham! Your cold-hearted friend January, came packed with bitter cold, blankets of snow, and frigid wind. She overstayed her welcome and to be honest, we‚Äôre happy to see her go.

We‚Äôve been pleasantly awaiting your arrival since December 31, looking forward to your warmer demeanor. Feel free to unpack lots of sunshine, warmer temps, and southern gentle breezes. And if you‚Äôre feeling extra generous ‚Äì please show us a 40 degree day.

Please be kind to us for the remainder of your 28 day stay.

Yours truly,

David Evans Strickler, a 23-year-old apprentice pharmacist at Tassel Pharmacy, located at 805 Ligonier Street in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, who enjoyed inventing sundaes at the store's soda fountain, invented the banana-based triple ice cream sundae in 1904. The sundae originally cost 10 cents, twice the price of other sundaes, and caught on with students of nearby Saint Vincent College. News of a new variety of sundae quickly spread by word-of-mouth and through correspondence, and soon progressed far beyond Latrobe., Its MooVie Night...

Butter Pecan
You‚Äôre a little old fashioned and maybe a little conservative. You‚Äôre a hard worker who is detail-oriented at work and in your social life. (And very respectful to your date.) So while you are kind of conservative, you also are a decadent person. Sure, you can be all business. But when you‚Äôre ready to unwind, you unwind with the best of them.

Chocolate
Chocolate is for kids at heart. You know how kids say the darndest things? Well, yousay the darndest things. And since you get bored easily and don‚Äôt have a filter, you will tell people you are bored. Or that you don‚Äôt like them. Or that you aren‚Äôt having fun on your date. At least you‚Äôre honest. And when you do find someone, you‚Äôll be really happy. You‚Äôre also really creative and talented, though, and very enthusiastic.

Neapolitan
Make up your mind! You have a trouble making decisions. You‚Äôre also kind of immature and like people to baby you.

Chocolate Chip
You‚Äôre all about fun. You‚Äôre into sports and like to compete. You laugh a lot and are really generous. Total extrovert ‚Äî you‚Äôre the life of the party. But you are also pretty classic.

Double Chocolate Chunk
You share many characteristics with the chocolate chip lovers, but you‚Äôre way more extreme. You do whatever you want and just don‚Äôt give a damn. You‚Äôre like the chocolate chip lover‚Ä¶ on crack.

Mint Chocolate Chip
You‚Äôre smart and kind of quiet. Your tastes are refined. And you are stubborn.

Rocky Road
You‚Äôre the boss of everyone and are used to people doing what you say.

Strawberry
You‚Äôre young at heart and very thoughtful. You don‚Äôt jump into unknown situations and love tradition. You‚Äôre committed in your relationships, although it takes you a long time to get to that point because you are kind of shy.

Vanilla
You my friend, are not vanilla. You are daring and experiment with a lot of new things, taking high risks and setting huge goals for  yourself. You are sure of yourself and don‚Äôt fall for trends just because they‚Äôre trends. And you‚Äôre stubborn. 10,000,000 people could jump off a bridge and try to convince you to stop liking vanilla ice cream and you won‚Äôt do it.

Coffee
You‚Äôre lively, passionate, and pretty impulsive. You start things all the time and don‚Äôt finish them because you get bored easily and sometimes have a hard time focusing.
 
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough
You are really indulgent and party your ass off. You do what you feel like doing basically all the time, regardless of what your work schedule is or what other people think. You plan stuff for your friends and get them psyched to follow your lead. Your philosophy is, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù And you‚Äôll try anything once. Or twice, depending on how drunk you were the first time., According to this month's Real Simple Magazine the average American eats 48 pints of ice cream in a year...I think New Englanders should be better than average !, Support Global Cooling....Eat More Ice Cream !, Flavor Up : Chilled Strawberry Soup
