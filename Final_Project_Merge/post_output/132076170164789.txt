Thank you NYC and Hub Seventeen Nyc for starting your week with us, it was fire!! I have some exciting news to share with you all soon, stay tuned ;).  #somethingscoming, Taking this day in my studio to write, listen, and open my body up to whatever songs are shyly or boldly beckoning to come forth from the earth. 

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Opening Address to the 1964 Berlin Jazz Festival:

God has wrought many things out of oppression. He has endowed his creatures with the capacity to create‚Äîand from this capacity has flowed the sweet songs of sorrow and joy that have allowed man to cope with his environment and many different situations.

Jazz speaks for life. The Blues tell the story of life's difficulties, and if you think for a moment, you will realize that they take the hardest realities of life and put them into music, only to come out with some new hope or sense of triumph.

This is triumphant music.

Modern jazz has continued in this tradition, singing the songs of a more complicated urban existence. When life itself offers no order and meaning, the musician creates an order and meaning from the sounds of the earth which flow through his instrument.

It is no wonder that so much of the search for identity among American Negroes was championed by Jazz musicians. Long before the modern essayists and scholars wrote of racial identity as a problem for a multiracial world, musicians were returning to their roots to affirm that which was stirring within their souls.

Much of the power of our Freedom Movement in the United States has come from this music. It has strengthened us with its sweet rhythms when courage began to fail. It has calmed us with its rich harmonies when spirits were down.

And now, Jazz is exported to the world. For in the particular struggle of the Negro in America there is something akin to the universal struggle of modern man. Everybody has the Blues. Everybody longs for meaning. Everybody needs to love and be loved. Everybody needs to clap hands and be happy. Everybody longs for faith.

In music, especially this broad category called Jazz, there is a stepping stone towards all of these. #mlkday, oh hey, come follow me on instagram if you haven't yet. love you. insta: @gracewebermusic, In honor of #SundayNightFootball, here is the official NBC footage of my National Anthem performance at the New York Giants game a few Sundays back!

Really proud of this one and excited to be in the same article as Jessie Ware and Prince! Thanks Ken Capobianco for this write up.

"What makes Weber so special and worth hearing is she sounds like Grace Weber. This is a unique artist with a rich voice and a clear understanding how to use it. The songs here are smartly conceived, beautifully arranged and sung with a clarity and style very rarely heard these days...In fact, this is easily one of the most assured, confident sets of soul infused pop released this year.", Thanks to Elmore Magazine for the sweet review of The Refinery! Listen to my entire new album on Spotify or iTunes today! 

"The Refinery will appeal to fans of blue-eyed soul singer/songwriters like Duffy, Joss Stone, and Jackie DeShannon. Weber‚Äôs vocal delivery is polished but honest, sometimes smoky, often agile, with a clear, bright edge that illuminates her lyrics.", It was pretty amazing to sit down with Access Hollywood and talk about my new album.

He wrote ‚ÄòGirlfriend‚Äô when he first moved to New York from New Zealand. 'I‚Äôm trying to pay rent' is probably the most universal song lyric about New York that has ever existed.‚Äù
