http://www.whosay.com/l/PitaGSi, The greatest shooters I've ever seen are Stephen Curry, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Larry Bird and Jerry West., I think there is going to be a Game 7., Golden State doesn't understand how difficult it is going to be to close out the Cavs especially the way LeBron is playing., Andre Iguodala just has to make one adjustment on his free throw shooting and that's get more lift on his follow through and in his legs!, Stephen Curry has flipped the script on Dellavadova, picking him up on defense  full court and being physical has taken him out of the game., The reason Golden State is winning this series is because of their great defense which equals good offense., LeBron has little help and Steph has a lot of help. That's what this series has come down to., The matchup between LeBron James and Steph Curry has been everything that it was advertised to be., I guess we won't be hearing anymore about Matthew Dellavadova shutting down Steph Curry after Steph scored 37pts in Game 5., The 2 best players put on a show in tonight. LeBron James w/ 40pts in a triple double & Steph Curry w/ 37pts to give GS a 3-2 series lead!, There aren't too many adjustments the Cavs can make because of the shortage of personnel., The Warriors two leaders came to play last night, Curry w/ 22pts and Green w/ 17pts 7reb & 6ast and they both never complained to the refs., The Warriors' defense, physical play and transition offense was to much for the Cavs to handle., The next adjustment that Coach Kerr made was playing "small ball", which allowed them to pressure the Cavs full court and wear them down., The first adjustment Coach Kerr made was starting Andre Iguodala who scored 22pts and played great defense on LeBron James., Warriors' Coach Steve Kerr gets the game ball after last night's blow out win against the Cavs in Game 4!, I love Okafor because he's won a state championship in HS, NCAA Title at Duke and he can bring that championship pedigree to the Lakers., Jahlil Okafor worked out for the Lakers on Tuesday., LeBron, don't listen to anybody, keep shooting as many times as you have to for your team to win!, After the first 3 games LeBron James should be on everybody's Mt. Rushmore...including mine!, The Warriors' Barnes & Bogut are struggling right now, so Coach Kerr must find more time for Iguodala & Lee who both played great in Game 3., In Game 4 all the Golden State Warriors need to do is play the way they did in 4th qtr of Game 3., Coach Kerr now must make adjustments on the Cavs pick & roll with LeBron James.
