It has been a wonderful year so far, and we are very much looking forward to celebrating with everyone. 
Nishioka san himself is working hard to prepare a speech so be ready! Please join us (5:00 PM - 11 PM) for a special surprise!, As many of you know, our name, "Yume wo Katare" means "express your dreams." Whether it is through encouraging our customers to hang up their dreams on our walls, or simply overcoming a huge bowl of buta ramen, we love to support everyone in their endeavors. Our chef and shop owner has a dream of his own in improving his skill set to make the best ramen and help everyone realize their dreams. Please continue to support us while Nishioka san returns to Japan every month for three days to "level up." We will post our calendar each month on Facebook and in the shop. 

Thank you so much for your support!, Our one year anniversary is coming next month! Keep an eye out for celebratory details!
