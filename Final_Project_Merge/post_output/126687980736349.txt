Some 'Ting Nice believes in controlled free-style cooking, with a slash to the avant-garde, yet with feet faithful grounded in the traditional techniques, seasonings and spices of its rich and colorful Caribbean heritage, all dedicated to "Feed Yo Senses".

Its philosophy is one of ‘Welcome home’, with ingredients chosen for local and some imported from markets around the Caribbean, all this so diners feel like being in a Caribbean home, thus transporting their guests to the tropical shores and the warmth of Caribbean hospitality, presentation starts with a small bowl of soup to Pepper Shrimp, Codfish sands or Curry Mussels  to  Mespo Valley Pork, Tobago Special or even a hot Trini Roti and desserts like Black cake and Cassava pone served with Rum sauce, all served on stark white plates and for fellow West Indians, a trip back to childhood memories of Aunty Mable, Mama Jen or granny's cooking out side on a coal pot.

The menu pays homage to places and sayings from around the Caribbean diaspora , like "Leh we start now", "De Main dish", dishes named after villages and towns that make for great and interesting history lesson. 

With a liquor license in the works, one can heighten the Caribbean experience with traditional drinks like Sorrel, Mauby, Ginger Beer, Fruit punch, Carrot Juice and Cucumber Juice as well as Coca Cola products and coconut water.

Caribbean flags hang above the bar and The wall of Caribbean Heroes behind the bar and The wall of Maps of Caribbean islands both works in progress.

Set amidst a tropical 7' x 75' hand painted mural of scene of Sun, Sea,  Mountains and Sky, the decor is effortlessly quintessential Caribbean with comfortable seated dinning for 42 and a lounge area that seats 10.

There is a small stage at the back of the restaurant where the spoken word, jazz, blues and other forms of live entertainment will take place on Friday and Saturday evenings as the weeks progress.

Anse La Raye or Anse-La-Raye is the largest town in Anse la Raye Quarter, Saint Lucia; it is located on the island's western side, near Marigot Bay. It is a picturesque place with fine examples of French and English colonial architecture.
The name Anse la Raye is derived from the rays that are found in the bay, the English translation means Bay of Rays. Two rivers flow into the bay, these are the Grande Rivière de l'Anse la Raye and the Petite Rivière de l'Anse la Raye. On a Friday night there is a fish fry where the local fishermen showcase their skills and where lobsters, fish and lambi (conch) are cooked and eaten. The Fish Fry is located on Front Street which runs parallel to the beach.
The local Catholic church was built in 1907, but records show that a chapel has existed since 1765. The present church has murals painted by the St Omer Family. Nearby attractions include the Anse la Raye Falls and the River Rock Falls., SEA FOOD ALERT! Friday night special-
