Thanks so much to the 220+ of you who took time out of your day today to support our plans. We just got out of the Licensing meeting, and were officially approved for our license to operate on Inn street! :)

Yahoo!, Hello Friends! We need you! 

Please sign our petition (http://www.metzys.com/inn-street-cart/) in support of our application to operate a push cart to serve Metzy's burritos, chips/salsa and other fine fare!

Licensing committee meets at 7pm tonight and is only giving out ONE new license-- sign our petition here: http://www.metzys.com/inn-street-cart/
 
We have a SUPER OPPORTUNITY, to immediately establish a downtown presence on Inn Street!

WE NEED YOUR HELP!  We meet with the NBPT Licensing Committee TONIGHT, Monday March 7th at 7pm, in the NBPT Police Station conference room. We have applied for a permit to operate a push cart that will serve Metzy's burritos, chips/salsa, and other fine fare, in addition to the truck and Cantina (opening soon).

We have been told that our application is not the only application that has been submitted for this ONE AVAILABLE ANNUAL PERMIT, so we are asking our customers and fans to help us make sure our application is the one that gets approved, by showing your support. If willing to support our plans to bring Metzy's delicious food to Inn Street, please take 30 seconds to fill out this quick form and we will include your info in our application to the Licensing Commission.

See YOU at the truck! #freshfoodfast #foodtrucks #wedeliver #beerandtacos, Friends - thanks so much for the continued support for Metzy's in the Best of North Shore Reader's Choice Awards ("BONS")!  Every vote helps, so please consider sharing with your own social media universes, if willing :)

Heads up - For those of you who have already voted.  Metzy's was recently added to the "MEXICAN" category, so please consider going in and voting again under that category if willing.  Also, several friends have mentioned that you can vote multiple times, assuming not within same 24 hour period - Again, if willing...:) 

FYI - We are getting VERY CLOSE to "go time" for Metzy's Cantina!  Stay tuned, we hope to start sharing firm timelines very soon.  We simply await one last approval from MBTA and then can get the project rolling!

Voting ends May 1, 2016

See you at the truck!, 11-7:30PM at the NBPT Train Station (#5 Boston Way), serving to the many participants and volunteers of the AWESOME ANNUAL “NORTH POLE EXPRESS”!

Today’s offerings (due to high volume in short amounts of time for the N Pole Express gang), we will be offering METZY'S SPEEDO BURRITOS – Half burritos pre-wrapped and ready to grab and go.  Full truck menu also available, but wait times will vary.

Today is a remarkable opportunity for us to both be a part of such a special event (sponsored and run by the wonderful people at Immaculate Conception Church here in Newburyport).  But also, for the following great news that we can FINALLY SHARE…

As of this week we have finally, officially received the signed and fully executed LEASE from MBTA for “Metzy’s Cantina” to open at the Newburyport Train Station.  Our current goal is to be open by the end of January or worst case sometime in February, 2016.  Stay tuned for further timeline updates here on social media, but the “DEAL IS DONE” so to speak!  We hope you share our excitement in this awesome news! 

In meantime…

See you at the truck!, 11-2 today (Fri) at historic Plum Island Airfield.

See you at the truck!, I hope that our local friends will take a moment to check out this video featuring Dancing Goats Dairy, a FANTASTIC and growing local artisan cheese maker.  The video is outstanding, and was done by our friends at Anchor Hitch Media.  Mary Boland is a local treasure of a videographer - Anyone who has video projects they are looking for help with, should contact Mary.

Metzy's was fortunate enough earlier this year to have the local community rally around our emergency request for financial help (to support our due diligence & pre-permitting cost concerns related to our application to MBTA for moving our home base of operations to the local Newburyport MBTA Train Station/Depot) through "Kickstarter".  Anchor Hitch Media helped us out with valuable video content back then as well.  The overwhelming support of our KS campaign (409 "backers"!) allowed us to get through the early hurdles required, to ultimately secure the Newburyport MBTA Train Station as our new home-base-of-operations/Commercial Kitchen/Commissary & Restaurant.  We will be finally breaking ground on the project in coming weeks! 

Dancing Goats Dairy is currently running a Kickstarter campaign https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dancinggoatsdairy/dancing-goats-dairy-artisan-cheese-in-coastal-new , which is described in more detail in the video.  We felt compelled to become a "backer" for their campaign, and hope you will consider helping them out as well.  This is local, community based business networking and support at its best.  

See you at the truck!, We are closed today (Fri Nov 20th) for scheduled seasonal maintenance.  No worries, we will be back and serving your favorite local food tomorrow!  We will be at NBPT Brewing Co. tomorrow night (Sat 21st) for “Metzy’s After Dark”, and we MIGHT actually be there for lunch tomorrow as well – Check FB and our website for up-to-date details tomorrow morning.

With the beautiful weather, we expect that we will have a large number of customers stop by in the next hour to hour and a half and don't want to cause problems in terms of longer waits for those people. We are working on longer term solutions to how we handle the situation, but we're testing this idea for now. Please offer any comments here or to your server about how you feel about this strategy.  As always thank you so much for all of your support!  The online ordering function will be disabled by 12:20, and we expect we will reenable the function by 2 p.m.

FYI - We had some difficulties with order lead times over this past weekend, and are considering only offering online ordering for weekdays through the summer weather months.  Please be sure to offer your feedback of this idea to your server at the truck, if you have a strong opinion one way or the other.  We want to serve our customers the best we possibly can.  For now, we feel that maintaining online ordering for weekdays is crucial for our customers who work.  Please note that we have started to adjust the “lead times” for online orders, to more closely match the actual length of time orders are taking to make from when they are placed to when they are ready.  We hope this feature is helpful to our customers who have limited lunch time…Today’s online orders are expected to take between 15-20 minutes as an example – this detail will be updated mid-lunch if we experience a heavy rush.  This is a trial run for this program, so please bear with us – we are all about doing whatever we can to satisfy our customers!

 

See you at the truck!, Closed one more Monday as we await the return of a bunch of our college/summer staff. 

 

We are hopeful to start our expanded schedule next Monday, which will include not just being open Mondays for lunch, but also will include longer hours on weekends and select “nice” days, and possibly a test-run of our much-anticipated breakfast menu in a few weeks!  Please stay tuned on FB or any of our social media sites, for details of our expanded schedule.

 

We will be sending out a detailed Kickstarter update this week as well, so if you are one of our “backers”, please look out for that email – Lots of fun updates related to the re-activation of the Newburyport Train Station, can’t wait to share them with all of our friends and supporters!

 

Update:  We are spending time this week trying to decide the best way for us to handle online ordering, for the days we know we will be extremely busy.  We are considering a few options, and will be asking for our customers to weigh in this week on what is the best way for us to handle wait-time concerns that are arising from receiving so many orders all at once.  Before we make any decisions that will impact our customers, we would like to get some feedback on the ideas we are considering.

 

Have a great day today, and

For our Kickstarter “Backers”, we will be starting the process of sending out the rewards to all of our backers, tomorrow night.  Please give some thought (30 characters or less) to what your preference is for how your name will appear on the commemorative plaque that we will permanently install in the new restaurant.  That will be one of the questions posed in tomorrow night’s “survey” that we will send from Kickstarter.  Other questions (depending on the backer level you chose) will include things like t-shirt size and mailing address, etc.  We expect to start sending out physical and electronic rewards by the end of next week.  Just wanted to keep you all updated.
 
And as for progress on the project, we are moving along very nicely.  Lots of nuts and bolts concerns that we are handling between now and when we start construction, but many of the overhanging tasks that need to be completed to get us started on construction, are falling into place on schedule.  We look forward to posting more visual updates very soon!

Update for the rewards to our “Kickstarter” supporters and friends who contributed to our successful campaign to raise $30k toward the re-opening of the Newburyport Train station as Metzy’s Taqueria - The custom Metzy’s coffee mugs are shipping out to us in the next few weeks, and we are busy preparing all of our t-shirts, bracelets, and food coupons.  We have been holding off on sending out the big email to request correct name spellings, shirt size(s), shipping address(es), etc.  That email will come soon, but since Kickstarter only allows us to send one email for that purpose, we are first making sure we have everything all set and in order.

Progress is happening quickly with respect to the Metzy’s new restaurant project at the Train Station.  We will be providing updates very soon, including the most recent design drawings and some rough timeline estimates.  This is a very exciting time for us, and its all BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS!  :)
 
For all of our awesome 409 Kickstarter “backers” – we are working on the details of how & when we will be sending out the rewards.  Please expect to receive a “survey” from Kickstarter that will ask for firm details related to how (or “if”, for any of you who would prefer to remain anonymous) your name will appear on the plaque we will be installing in the new restaurant, as well as any other details we may need regarding shirt size, color of bracelet, address, etc – depending on which level of reward you chose.  The t-shirts are ready, the coffee mugs are being shipped to us in the next 2-3 weeks, the bracelets are ready, the food certificates can be provided anytime, and for the 3 parties we have booked one date already and still need to book the other two (I will be in touch with you guys directly today, to offer ideas for dates, etc)
 
Feeling so grateful and so excited about everything we are working on!  Onward and upward! 

See you at the truck!
 
#metzysatpondsttoday, Good news and bad news – The good news is that tomorrow we will be open on Pond St down by the Bartlett Mall.  The bad news?  So sorry about the late notice, but due to multiple last-minute staffing issues, we will be CLOSED TODAY!  So very sorry about today :(  Tomorrow we will…
 
See you at the truck!, A sample of what we provided our guests at this past Saturday's awesome  Northshore Magazine Grand Tasting - We are so happy to have been a part of the event, and we got tons of awesome feedback and compliments.  Great job Chef Brad and Brittany!  :), We are closed today and will be open tomorrow for lunch (location tbd, please stay tuned :) )
 
YOU ALL DID IT FOR US!!!!  Thanks to 409 “backers” pledging a grand total of $30,701 over the course of the last 25 days – We have reached our $30,000 Kickstarter goal and will begin the process of sending out surveys to all of our backers to express our gratitude and to also request specific updates related to how/if you want your name(s) to appear on the commemorative plaque, as well as shirt size(s), bracelet color, etc.  All pledge levels will have different surveys that are specific to the stated rewards.  We have received several requests already for updating the way that our backers’ names appear, and it became obvious quickly that it would be much easier for us to address that issue along with other survey-type of questions, upon successful completion of the fundraising period of the project.  Please expect our “backers” surveys to go out later today or first thing tomorrow.  We are only allowed to send ONE survey to all 409 backers through the Kickstarter platform, so want to be sure we have all the details correct before we send it.
 
As you all know, the $30,000 goal was necessary for us to “Kickstart” our much bigger plans for building out a vibrant bistro/café version of Metzy’s Taqueria at the Newburyport brick building by the train station. We will be updating our Kickstarter page regularly in weeks and months to come, with details related to how our overall project is coming along – YOU ALL ROCK!  I have so much pride and so much gratitude in my heart today, toward all of you and all of our extended friends and family/supporters network.  409 people willing to make financial pledges toward our plans, tells me we are doing something very important and we have an idea that will really work!  Can’t wait to show you all what we will be doing!  You are going to love it!  :)
 
See you at the truck! (And soon at the Depot!), Last call for any friends and supporters who may not have yet had a chance to pledge to our kickstarter project. The project will close at 4:38 PM in like 15 minutes :-)   http://tinyurl.com/metzyskickstarter .As we have mentioned this is a neat way to be a part of history and be listed on the commemorative plaque that we will have every one of our backers listed on., One last reminder that all names of backers/supporters of our Kickstarter project will be prominently and proudly displayed in the new restaurant on a commemorative plaque.  Any pledges we receive in excess of our goal in the next few hours will go directly toward the procurement of the commemorative plaque which will list all of our supporters (option for anonymity will be offered, and no $ amounts will be listed next to names).  If we receive more funds than we need for the plaque, then any further funds will be allocated toward our new appliances budget.  For any supporters who may still like to be listed on the plaque but have not yet pledged toward our Kickstarter project, you still have a few hours left to pledge!  :)

http://tinyurl.com/MetzysDailyNews031715 - Check out this awesome front-page story about our expansion plans, in today’s Daily News!  And Happy St Patty’s Day everyone by the way!  

We would like to take a moment to thank a few of our key local partners on this dynamic project, who have all put in many hours (and will be continuing to do so) and have lent great expertise to us while we have navigated our way through the processes of working with the MBTA to make our dreams a reality.  Looking forward to really getting rolling guys!

•	Attorney Rob Ciampitti Jr. of local law firm “Liberty Law”, http://ciampittilaw.com/ciampitti-firm-resume/  has been instrumental in working directly with the MBTA and their real estate law firm, ever since our “letter of designation” was awarded approximately a month ago – Rob, you rock, thanks so much for all you do!
•	Architect John Sava http://www.savaarchitects.com/ - John’s vision and flexibility has been instrumental in the process – Can’t wait to get the FINAL design drafts today!  
•	Caswell Development – Jay Caswell & Jim Caponigro – http://caswelldevelopment.com/ THANK YOU guys for being so understanding and available throughout this process.  Pretty sure I have asked Jim to meet us for important discussions with less than an hour’s notice, and he always seems to somehow find the time!
•	Brian Callahan of Helium Design – http://www.heliumdesign.com/ Brian designed the graphics on the truck, he has created all of our graphic materials, and is a constant voice of reason and sounding board for all topics (related and unrelated to the biz! ).  If your business is in need of graphic design or web-based design help, I highly recommend Brian.
•	To all of my friends and close confidants who have listened and provided advice across marketing and business topics, THANK YOU!

MOST IMPORTANTLY – THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS TO ALL OF OUR KICKSTARTER SUPPORTERS.  As Bon Jovi would say “Woah, we're half way there; Woah, livin' on a prayer; Take my hand, we'll make it I swear; Woah, livin' on a prayer”  Ok, that may sound cheesy, but it is how I feel at this point and it is true!  We are literally halfway through our Kichstarter Campaign, and we are halfway to our goal of $30,000.  Please keep the beat going for us, and help spread the word!  I know we can make it to our goal by March 29th, when the Kickstarter project closes – As many of you know Kickstarter is an “all-or-nothin” crowdfunding platform – so we must succeed!  http://tinyurl.com/metzyskickstarter

Pure heaven! Come on down to get a couple of these for lunch before we close at 2 PM today.

Friends and supporters, please continue the effort to spread the word about our kick starter project to enable us to reactivate the Newburyport train station. We need everyone's help in this community-focused endeavor.  "Many hands make light work" as the saying goes… If we can get 1000 of our regular customers to contribute at the $20 kickstarter level, we will be well on our way to our goal of 30,000! :-) We need participation so the more the merrier!

See you at the truck!, Yeah, just another typical Thursday night at the Newburyport Brewing Co.! 

What a blast :-)

See you at the truck!, This is no longer a rumor!  :)  We look forward to "reactivating" the station and working with our friends in the community to improve the connection with public transportation all over town.  Lots of fun stuff in the works, please consider supporting our Kickstarter campaign in our efforts to advance this community-oriented project.  This project is going to happen one way or the other, but if we can get our short-term Kickstarter goal of $30k funded, it will allow us to open our doors in time for late spring/early summer.  We are humbly asking the community to help us out.  Many thanks to the Chamber for sharing this by the way!, Happy “Thirsty Taco Thursday"!  We will be “in the Park” today, serving lunch from 11-1:30pm out of the Mark Richey Woodworking parking lot (40 Parker St Newburyport, MA), and as usual we will be serving dinner at the Newburyport Brewing Co.

I wanted to alert everyone to our “Kickstarter" campaign, which we just launched last night.  

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1443900184/metzys-taqueria-expansion-to-the-newburyport-train

Please consider supporting our plans to completely renovate and build-out the dormant Newburyport Train Station, into a vibrant bistro/Café.

After 9 months of unprecedented success with Metzy’s Food Truck, we find ourselves needing our own commissary space.  We have found a fantastic symbiotic location, in the local Newburyport Train Station, which has been sitting dormant since 2005.  We have completed exhaustive due diligence on the building, and have put in the work to prove that we will be able to succeed.  The location is “symbiotic”, in that the City, State, MBTA, and Metzy’s will all be benefitting from our plans and from the location becoming the vibrant café/bistro that we will be putting there.
 
We are seeking $30,000 in the very short term from this Kickstarter campaign, which will serve as a financial “bridge” to allow us to stay on-plan to launch the new restaurant in time for the late spring/early summer season.  The remainder of the capital needed for this project will be coming from more traditional SBA loans, and then there will be future F&F investment opportunities that will be announced later this year.  Very exciting times!  

If interested, please click the link and check out our video and consider supporting us on our Kickstarter page.

We got several responses already for our HELP WANTED post from yesterday - thank so much!  We still need to fill several positions and shiFts ( :) sorry for the typo in yesterday's post!), so please keep forwarding any interested parties our way (erik@metzys.com) and we will get them an employment application asap.

See you at the truck!, We will be closed today (Monday) and will re-open tomorrow (Tues) at 11:30 AM at the Plum Island Airfield.

Please note, we ARE HIRING new staff, effective immediately!  If you or someone you know is interested in asap employment, please have them reach out by email to erik@metzys.com and we will get them an employment application.

We have been blessed with a fantastic crew since we opened, and now that we are losing many of the existing crew (all of whom want to come back next summer!) to head back to school – we now need to fill many shifts if we are to remain open in coming days/weeks!.  We really, desperately need a few asap hires, so any networking help is greatly appreciated!  I will be using more traditional outlets for finding staff very soon (job sites, craigslist, etc), but given our community feel I prefer to find people through the friend network, as that served us very well with our staff for the summer.

In general, we need the most help on weekdays but some weekend help as well.  Here is a partial list of the positions and shifts that we need to hire for.  Pay scales are competitive with the market, and as a bonus for those who work on the truck all share equally and proportionally based upon hours in “pooled” tips for their shifts.  

1) Sous chef with restaurant cooking line (char-grill, stove, fryer, etc) experience.  This position includes prep work and must support and fill in for the head chef when needed and assist them in resolving any problems that may arise on the job.  Candidates for this position must possess the ability to quickly and authoritatively delegate job tasks to others.  Candidates for this position must either already be Servsafe Manager certified, or be willing and able to pass the exam to be certified, which we will pay for.
2) Kitchen prep/break-down and clean up – We need help from 6 am – 11 am 4-5 days per week, days tbd;  also may need help from 3pm-8pm 1-3 days per week, also tbd – depends on tbd factors
3) Line cook/Fryer – This position is vital for our busier shits.  This candidate will mostly work on the truck and help with daily set-up/break-down.  Also responsible for the fry station.  Help needed 3-4 weekdays per week from 10 AM – 3 PM.  Possibly also need this position for a couple of weekend shifts on an ad hoc basis.
4) Expeditor – This position is also vital for our busier shifts – This candidate must be comfortable with finishing and packaging quick-serve orders in concert with the Head Chef and/or Sous chef, and must be personable in interactions with customers and capable of staying cool under pressure. Help needed 3-4 weekdays per week from 10 AM – 3 PM.  Possibly also need this position for a couple of weekend shifts on an ad hoc basis.
5) Manager – We need a manager with restaurant experience, to take over with daily operations – This is a position that is contingent upon the strategic growth plans we are working on.  We should know in 1 week if this position is needed.  Right now it looks 85% likely that we will need this position, and the hire date will be Sept 1, 2014 or as soon as possible.  Those with restaurant management experience who are interested should call me directly to discuss (617)-448-9435.
6) Order taker and customer service (front-line with customers – person must be personable, quick on feet, and able to multi-task in a fast-paced environment – all while holding a smile and being sweet to our customers  :) ) - need help from 11am-4pm daily, and Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays we may need help afternoon shifts (late closing shifts are usually 3-8PM) – looking for filling this position for all 7 days, and having back-up help when needed for call-outs.
7) Dessert Chef/Soups, etc – We will likely want a 3-4 day a week position (hours flexible) to make our soups as well as new and interesting menu-right desserts.  Candidates should have some experience cooking in Commercial kitchens, and/or be certified or willing to become certified as Servsafe Managers.

Thanks!  FYI – this truck and the environment we are working in is FUN!  :)  Hard work and fast-paced, but really, really fun and cool!  And we are growing – We will not be slowing down anytime soon, as we have some interesting plans in the works that new employees will be very excited to be a part of!, We will be opening up at 11:30 AM today at the Plum Island Airfield, and will remain open until 7 PM.

Remember that our online ordering system is working (http://tinyurl.com/metzysonlineorder), so please consider using that function, if you would like to order ahead.  FYI: For now, online ordering requires prepayment by credit card.  Also, our online ordering app is defaulted to say that the food will be ready in 30 minutes, but from this past week's experience, online orders are usually completed and ready from 10-20 minutes after placing order, at the most.  We are working with our Point of Sale vendor on a way that we can be more precise with this information at the online check-out, but for now this is how it is.

See you at the truck!, How cool is this?  Tom Walsh of Shoreline Aerial Photography www.shoreline-aerial.com - provided us with this clear shot of Metzy's Taqueria and its roof message "TACOS" from the sky.

Stay tuned!, Hello all - We will be located at the Bartlett Mall today from 11:30 - 3 (we may need to close a little early today, so please come early!).

Oh, and we will be serving Chococoa Metzy's Whoopie Pies today - get them while we have them - we only ordered 24 of them for this first time.  Also we are adding a "kid's taco" to our menu.  Meat, cheese, lettuce only - Kid's Chicken or Pork tacos for $2.50 & Kids Steak tacos $3.00., null, We will be opening at 11:30 this morning for lunch service. At the Plum Island Airfield.

Heads up that we are ordering a corn hole set for our guests to play with while hanging out it's Metzy's.  I would be psyched to see a customer organized corn hole tournament or summer league put together and would be happy to be the title sponsor :-)  anyone interested, please private message me or give me a shout or stop by., Looking forward to all the great Selfies I know we will get to see!, I love these guys!  CROSS FIT FULL POTENTIAL baby!  :)

Maybe we will be located at CFFP one day late next week, stay tuned for that one - We have only committed through next Tuesday for locations and times, so the second half of next week is up for grabs :)  Looking for more great locations in the Industrial Park, if anyone has a connection?

Thanks so much as always for your support!, My lovely wife asked that I post the photo she took of her shrimp taco she had for lunch today :)  Thanks hon!, How did you like the tacos Jamie?, Our first official paying customer!  :)  Thanks Ron Frost!  Standing with friend Mr Ron Barrett!, Ok, we are opening the window for service for a couple of hours, if interested in stopping by.

We will be updating this page daily over next few days to inform exactly when and where we will be open.  See you soon!  :), null, Looking forward to all the great Selfies I know we will get to see!, Looking forward to all the great Selfies I know we will get to see!, A note to all our friends and supporters regarding our planned launch dates and locations: (I will continue to post updates as we get closer to the opening):  

When?  Probably Mon April 28th will be our first official day we will be open and serving lunch to the public.  We will consider that week to be our "soft" launch and will not be doing much if any reaching out prior to opening that week in terms of signage, emails, etc.  We will also start that week with a limited menu as we get our balance.  "GRAND OPENING WEEK" is expected to be May 4th - 11th, with a fun focus on Cinco de Mayo :)

Where?  We will PROBABLY stick to Plum Island Airfield for that first week, every day that week.  Once we are open, we will begin posting our next 2-weeks' planned locations and time/schedules on our website, on a rolling weekly basis.  

In general, we will be positioned at the Plum Island Airfield on Saturdays and Sundays on a regular basis (only excepting for inclement weather or off-site event based commitments - e.g. Yankee Homecoming, etc).  

We will likely be regularly positioned in a location on Parker St in the Industrial Park on some weekdays, and plan to also be in a location on Auburn St by the Mall one weekday per week.  We will be making more decisions on locations as we get feedback and learn what works and doesn't, so will not be setting firm locations outside of 2 weeks out.

Hours?  Our GOAL is to be in our daily position by 8 a.m. every day we are open (we need to get through a couple of weeks before we can be sure if this is realistic).  Assuming we can do this, Metzy's will serve coffee, juice and breakfast burritos from 8 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.  Lunch service will begin no later than 11 a.m. daily and will run at least through 1:15 p.m., later for busier days and locations.

Note: We will also be making weather-based schedule and location updates daily, and hope to offer a web enabled feature for quickly checking our exact locations up to the minute.  tbd.

Until we open, Brad and I are working hard on going through all of the many details required of opening a restaurant!  Can't wait to see and serve you all!  The support that all of you and the community as a whole have provided us with throughout this process has been humbling and AMAZING! 

PS:  If anyone knows a good local candidate for a 40hr/week position (7am-3pm 5 days/week), please have them reach out to me directly with their resume.  The position is basically a prep cook who can work efficiently in a team-based environment alongside the chef and can handle chopping (using knives), labeling, and following standardized Servsafe Health code regulations.  Starting pay will be competitive with similar positions at restaurants.  Possibility of upward mobility as the business grows, with plans to add responsibilities over time to this position.  We need this position filled FAST, to help us get rolling asap.  We have already gotten tons of offers from parents and kids who will be free starting June 1st.  This is not what i am looking for for this particular request.  We will be employing a few such summer positions, but will handle those hires later..., Looking forward to all the great Selfies I know we will get to see!, All systems go! We got our permit approved tonight by the Newburyport Board of Health! So excited & can't wait to start serving you all. A million thanks to all of our friends and supporters who wrote letters of support. It made a huge difference. We will be posting information soon on when we will be opening. There is still a lot to do but it will be very soon now :), Humbly request that all our supporters collectively offer their "good vibes" for us today, as our key meeting for final approvals to get started are happening this evening.  I expect that as of tomorrow our focus will finally shift from jumping through regulatory hoops, to setting the stage for an imminent launch/opening in coming weeks.  CAN'T WAIT to serve all of you with a big smile :)  For those many dozen friends and supporters who have already written letters of support for us, THANK YOU!  For those who would still like to, please email me at emetzdorf@metzys.com to inquire how you can help (we need all letters to be written, signed and scan/emailed to me prior to 4pm today).  For the letters to be used as part of our local board applications, letters must be written from residents and/or property owners or employees working in Newburyport., Metzy's is thrilled to announce BRAD DeLIBERO as head of our food operations!  Brad was trained at one of the top two culinary colleges in the country, Johnson & Wales in Providence, RI and has worked in the restaurant business for 15 years, including his role as Owner/Chef at Mad Martha's Beach Cafe on Plum Island, started the kitchen at the Plum Island Beachcoma and most recently head chef of Off the Vine Tuscan Grille in Rowley.  His experience with fresh food and creative recipes will bring wonderful quality and innovative flavors to the convenience of Metzy's Taqueria!, Would you wear this t-shirt if we make them?  :)  Asking for everyone to send positive vibes our way so we can get through this week's local inspections and permitting board votes, and start serving food as soon as possible!, Selfies at our truck are STRONGLY encouraged!  :)  Thanks Deb & Andy Casson for posting this great shot yesterday!, Just a little sneak-peek of the inside of the truck's kitchen - For those of you who have asked...:), http://www.sys-con.com/node/3035150 - so cool about our friends at Newburyport Brewing Co.!  Congrats guys!, So glad to have participated in today's Emma Andrews' "Souper Saturday" by providing our 3-meat chili recipe.  Donna Conway said that our chili recipe was a BIG HIT, and it was one of the first crock pots to be sold out today!  :)  Looking forward to actually serving our "Metzy's 3-Meat Chili" out of the truck to our customers, very soon!, #foodtruck pic.twitter.com/nWLLUaaDQv - Thanks Chris Howe, for noticing our truck parked today at the PI Airfield :)  stay tuned - looking forward to posting updates very soon.  No firm "open" date available as yet...soon, though!, null, So I don't think I ever expected these words would come from me, but "Thank You Oprah"!  :)  I recently reached out to friends asking for recommended vegetarian recipes and got many great responses, including this one.  I don't recall which friend shared this recipe with me, but I tested this sweet potato and black bean taco recipe http://www.oprah.com/food/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-and-Black-Bean-Tacos-Recipe tonight and it was fantastic!  I believe we will be including some variation of this recipe on the truck.  Delicious!  Who knew?, Please consider asking your local FB Friend network to visit & "like" our page at www.facebook.com/metzys !  ALSO - T-Shirt Design feedback request time!  Here are a couple of basic t-shirt designs we have mocked up.  We will be ordering some shirts and other merchandise as part of our launch.  Orders will go in next week, so I would love to hear from friends b4 then with opinions and ideas/ feedback for t-shirt designs, catch-phrases, or even other merchandise that you would like us to offer. I have already asked the designer to get us a couple of more mock-ups using phrases like "I "heart" tacos" and "Tacos Make me Happy".   Any fun ideas are appreciated - Have a great weekend!  Next week should be a pretty big week, in terms of announcements for Metzy's Taqueria!  Stay tuned., I cannot WAIT to drive the truck back from Rhode Island tomorrow!  Here are a couple more pics of the truck after getting wrapped..., Well, it's getting real now!  What do you think?, I thought it would be appropriate to post this here, as i could not figure out how to link the post from my personal FB page. 
Started Working at Metzy's—Owner Newburyport, Massachusetts;  One of those typical "you know what this town needs..." conversations over a couple of beers with friends late last summer, germinated the seed of an idea that has since grown into "Metzy's Taqueria" food truck! Even the greatest of ideas require hard work and determination before they can blossom. Over the past 7+ months, I have learned first-hand about municipal process and the realities of all that goes into successfully launching a new food truck business. Ever since last September, I have been completely devoted to bringing Newburyport its first (and only) full service mobile kitchen/Food Truck. From hundreds of hours of in-the-field market research (traffic counts, interviews, online surveys, etc), I learned that this idea was something the community really wants and will support. I also learned from my research that "Taqueria-style street food" was the food theme that was most requested and would work best. I learned that in order for my dream to become a reality, I needed to blaze the local regulatory trail, and push some boundaries that at times were a bit uncomfortable for all parties involved. I also learned that there is more investment needed behind the scenes to successfully launch a full service Gourmet Food Truck than what it might seem. Now that we are knocking on the doorstep of launching the business April 4th, 2014 (fingers crossed!), my focus is shifting to the product, and to how we can provide our customers with tasty Fresh.Food.Fast! Stay tuned for updates on our Facebook page www.facebook.com/metzys and please also consider signing up for our newsletter at www.metzys.com - we will be sending out offers and location details in this way, so it is a great way for you to be in the know! See you at Metzy's, very soon! :), Some last-minute design changes were made last night - These are the final approved graphics, that are on the vinyl printing press as we speak...looks like we are looking at Tuesday before I can drive Metzy's Taqueria home to Newburyport and start getting her inspected for asap service, etc.   (Note: there is also a fun roof text graphic to alert incoming pilots when we are at the PI Airfield - "TACOS" :)), Firming up the menu for purposes of filing with our Board of Health applications.  See below for our working draft.  Am feeling we are a bit light on veggie options, based on the feedback we have heard from all of you.  Please message me with any specific veggie taco or burrito recipes that you would like us to consider.  We have a probable bean burrito, but no veggie taco yet.  We are addressing "Paleo" options by offering lettuce wrap or bowls.  We will have at least 2 soups as well.  As we have said from the start, we will also be rotating specials based on seasonality and popular requests., Dreaming of delicious tacos and burritos...can't wait until we can be serving them to all of you!  :)

FYI, we are postponing "Tuesday Taco Day Test Kitchen" till next week.  One of our key crew is taking their state food safety exam tomorrow, and we are also working and focusing on permitting concerns, so we can be sure to open up as soon as humanly possible!, Here are a couple of designs for the truck wrap that we are looking at.  It looks like the truck will get wrapped the week of March 10th. Comments feedback and suggestions are appreciated, before we send the truck out for the wrapping., Opinion poll time!  Please offer opinions if interested, on the following menu related questions.
1) Are you more excited for ordering tacos or burritos from Metzy's Taqueria?
2) Would having some sort of user-friendly online pre-ordering app make it more likely you would eat at Metzy's Taqueria?
3) Are there one or two items in particular that you are expecting/hoping to see on our menu?  If so, please comment - 

We are finalizing the base menu this week, and if there are any highly requested items we are missing we may add them.  Please understand that since our menu will be very focused, we cannot accommodate all requests.  But we do plan to change up daily and weekly specials throughout the year.  Hoping to hear from lots of you! :-), I just wish that I could properly explain how delicious these breakfast burritos we made in test kitchen today tasted! :-) I think next week we're going to have to open up the test kitchen for people to stop by. Private message me if interested and we will try to accommodate., Metzy's Taqueria Food truck has approximately 10 more days worth of miscellaneous kitchen renovations and updates to satisfy the City's specific Local BOH compliance requirements.  After that, the truck will get a full-body design wrap, and then all we need is to get our permits and we will be ready to ROLL!  It's been a LONG regulatory road since October, but we are finally starting to see the finish line! :)  We will be posting fun food pics tomorrow of what we make for test-kitchen "TACO TUESDAY" 

Please also stay tuned in coming days, for more regular updates related to cool stuff like:

* Estimated time-frame for when we will be selling our first taco!
* Mock-ups and feed-back requests for super-cool t-shirt (and other merchandise) designs.
* Sneak peek of our menu!
* Hints on where and when we will be locating the truck
* et cetera, et cetera...:), Hi all!  Wow, what a long last week!  The truck is finally registered and insured!   A small victory!  :)  I am scheduling MA DOT inspection as we speak.  My Mass state Hawker/Peddler license just arrived today, the articles of org for the LLC are being processed, and I am Servsafe certified/allergy certified, etc. This week has been all about this kind of nitty gritty, nuts & bolts stuff that is a necessary part of launching this biz.  Not nearly as fun as "test kitchen" and menu building!  Can't wait to get back to food pictures and posts!  Still optimistic for serving our first food to customers in the month of March!  Fingers crossed as we feverishly work toward this goal!

We are having a bunch of work done to the truck's kitchen asap, in order to be able to submit our local BOH applications.  If you ever saw Pulp Fiction, you prob recall Harvey Keitel's character "The Wolf"?  I have enlisted the help of the Food-Truck-equivalent of "The Wolf" (a full service fabrication company specializing in concessions, based in Seabrook, NH), to help us quickly resolve the LONG punch-list of corrective update items that the City has provided me with, to get the truck ready for Nbprt BOH application & inspections.  

Question/Favor: Is there is anyone out there who can assist me with setting up 3-4 basic legal agreement templates? I am hopeful not to have to engage a 2nd law firm (I am already deep into unexpected legal costs related to regulatory issues).  There may be some free burritos in it for you, if you can help me get these agreements drafted  ha, ha! :)  They are a necessary part of the application process, and also very important for my financing.  Pls PM me or email me at emetzdorf@metzys.com if you have resources to assist with this request.  Thanks!, Wow!  What a fun/delicious "TEST KITCHEN" we had today!  Check out these pics from today's recipe test runs...Warning, these pics might make you hungry!  :)  Notice the pic of the "Shrimp and avocado salad" that we mentioned yesterday!  The tacos we tested today were a braised short rib with out-of-this-world great complimentary flavors (mango salsa, chipotle sour cream, jack cheese, deeeeelish!)!, As a little teaser, here is one recipe that will be on our "specials" rotation. "Shrimp and avocado salad: Cajun grilled shrimp, fresh avocado, mango, red onion, over romaine and arugula with a cilantro lime dressing." I am working on finalizing our menu items this week.

btw - I figured out over the weekend that in order for friends to "pin" recipe ideas to my Pinterest boards, we must 1st be "following" each other on Pinterest.  If any Pinterest users are interested in sharing recipes, please consider "following" me on Pinterest, and i will invite you to the boards we are using to generate menu ideas and options...

FYI - i am new to Pinterest, so i THINK i set these boards up correctly, but if i need to update anything to allow friends to pin recipes, please feel free to tell me!, Check out this "Version-1" idea for wrapping the truck - I dig it, but would love comments and ideas to pass along to the designer to further enhance..., Almost there! :-), Dreaming of Tacos al Pastor tonight...Mmmmmmm!!!!  Thank you Jamie, for pushing this as a "guest menu" item!  We are gathering "guest menu" items over the next couple of weeks, to help ensure that we respond to the many requests we are getting for specific items.  As mentioned, we will be constantly rotating specials around our base-menu, to make sure all our customers have the chance to try their favorite Taqueria items.  

I need to crash, so i can get up and go BUY THE TRUCK!!!!  :)  Will post something fun tomorrow - Any friends interested in swinging by to see the truck, please note it will be parked on Greenleaf (outside the fire station) on Wed from roughly 2-3pm.  I will have free coffee and donuts for friends who stop by :), Very exciting!  The truck is being thoroughly inspected now.  Assuming all goes well, it will be parked on on Greenleaf St in Newburyport tomorrow afternoon between 1-3pm.  I will have free coffee and donuts there, for anyone interested in swinging by...We will be going over some final details of the truck's kitchen.  Friends are welcome!  I am so excited this is moving forward - Can't wait to be serving you all and the community very soon!  :), I am very glad that we took that survey!  An overwhelming % of you suggested that we not include the sleeping figure, so that settles it!  Besides 29 people responding on our SurveyMonkey link, I was also personally contacted via email by 11 others!  Thank you all very much, for taking the time to weigh in on this topic.  

And thanks also, for some great feedback on menu ideas!, Quick Contest time!  3-Question survey (will only take like 10 seconds of your time) - Please take a close look at the two logos pictured below, and then vote for which logo you prefer at the survey link https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KDGVJG5 We MAY be updating the logo, for social conscience reasons.  Please feel free to send anyone you like this link..., I am SO appreciative tonight of all the offers of help that rolled in to answer my last post.  So far, i have someone taking care of the scaled CAD drawings of the truck's kitchen, I have been given 3 referrals to reputable local plumbers, a friend has generously offered to take care of the immediate need to launch a basic website on my domain, and I even have been given a strong lead to wrap the truck!  I am feeling really, really grateful!  Thanks to all of you!  Have a great weekend!  Looking forward to posting news next week about the truck inspections, and some menu stuff too!, I AM ASKING FOR HELP FROM OUR FB FRIENDS!

So I have exciting news!  We have found the truck to buy (see included pics)!  Over the last 12 weeks, I have looked at no less than 45 trucks.  The trucks I have been looking at are located all over the country, including Milwaukee, Rochester NY, Miami FL and all over the Northeast.  The truck that i have decided on is fairly local, in that it is located in Massachusetts.  The size, condition, layout, and related details all meet with our needs.  I am now in position to inspect the truck early next week, and there is some stuff I could use some friendly help with, asap.

Among MANY hurdles that still need to be crossed in terms of licensing and permitting - the following are issues that i am still searching for ways to resolve.  I have listed them in bullet form below - If any of our FB Friends or associates can offer advice, referrals, or even service - THERE JUST MAY BE SOME FREE BURRITOS in your future!  :)  Ha, ha!

* Need an asap, low-cost solution for drawing the kitchen of the truck - As part of our "Application for site plan review" there is a requirement to submit "Professionally drawn plans" showing i. Site and floor plan; ii. Elevation and wall floor joint details; iii. Lighting, plumbing/drainage details; iv. Lighting schedule and surface finish schedule;  Since this is a bit over my pay-grade in terms of simply drafting onto grid-paper - any helpful suggestions are welcome - The truck will be in Newburyport going through some inspections next Tues and Wed.  A draft designer could take all the measurements required to make appropriate drawings within probably 10 mins.  The entire kitchen is in a 14' x 8' space!  :)
* Licensed plumber - There is a small amount of plumbing work that still needs to be done in the kitchen - I have a guy who I usually use, but he is MIA.  Any referrals to a reasonably priced local licensed plumber would be greatly appreciated!
* Digital engagement - I would like to find someone to help me with setting and executing a realistic digital engagement plan for the launch as well as for the short then long term.  This is a service i am happy to pay for, but am cost-conscious on.
* Website development - I need immediate help in just getting a very basic website template up on my domain (like next week) - just a couple of pics, a few hyperlinks, and a generalized description of who we are and what we are doing.  I have NO budget for this alone.  But i do have a budget for this PLUS the service of working with me to develop and launch a decent site concurrent with our product launch.  This person would need to be pretty flexible, fairly priced, and willing to "shuck and jive" around a pretty frenetic schedule & environment in terms of working with me on this :)  My hosting package is with GoDaddy, if that means anything...
* Art - I have a truck wrapping design firm working on a Quote for this truck now.  However, I picked them from the phone book, basically - I would love a personal referral if anyone is aware of a good, fair, local option.

Feel free to PM me or email me at emetzdorf@metzys.com, or call me at 617-448-9435 if you have any ideas or feedback related to the above bullet points.

Thanks for your interest - SO MANY GREAT THINGS HAPPENING right now in the background on this!  All systems "go" for March launch still!  Will keep you all posted, and hope to be posting more fun stuff as we get closer to launch - stay tuned..., Menu Development started way back in October, with these two consultants offering their viewpoints.  :)  After months of market research, traffic counts, consumer interviews and similar - It seems they were pretty  on-point!  ha, ha!  More menu posts to come next week..., Thanks to all our friends who have helped with hand-drawings, comments & ideas related to the new "Metzy's Taqueria" Food Truck logo design - WE HAVE A WINNER!  :)  The colors can still be updated if need be, but the design is set.  I am ecstatic with the final result!  The next several posts will be focused on menu items, the actual truck (:)), probable site locations, and updates on permitting and timing for our Grand Opening.  Stay tuned!, Finalizing and refining the logo..., Ha, ha!  Who do I have to thank for this awesome gift I found in my mailbox today?, All comments & suggestions are welcome...At least til Tuesday (hey, wasn't that a band? :), I am afraid that my first post today may have gone under the radar - I intended for the two hand-drawings to be considered in perspective to the many different draft designs that can be viewed at this link http://124678.mycreativesamples.com/creatives/762395
Metzy's photo.  All related ideas and discussion are welcome, as I will be settling on a final design by next Tuesday.  Have a great weekend!, These two hand-drawings were done by a close friend - there is a LOT i like about this direction - please take these into consideration, if/when you review the draft logo ideas in the link in today's other post...Have a great weekend!, yummmm...:), Hello friends - This is still a very "soft" launch of a FB page for my new Food Truck business.  The website is not even up yet, and there are several hurdles yet to cross - but all seems to be moving in the right direction.  I appreciate your support and comments very much.  I will be aggregating all comments and ideas and doing my best to incorporate some of those ideas with our actual launch.  Stay tuned for more regular updates soon - and my hope is still to be selling food no later than March 2014!  :))
