Our dumpling of the day is the Xo Dumpling. This is made with a dry shrimp and ham mixture. Don't forget we also offer boba tea in a variety of flavors!, Dear Everyone:

Yes, 

we have been open, officially for 10 days, and everything is not perfect. 

1st problem:
Tickets were running up to an hour, in the first couple of days, as we had no griddle,  

Where are we now?  20 minutes at lunch and 10-12 minutes at dinner.

2nd Problem:
We mislabeled the Juicy Buns as "Soupy Buns"  ATTENTION EVERYONE, WE DON'T SELL SOUPY BUNS.  WE DON'T MAKE XIAOLONG BAO.  We sell " Juicy Buns"  They don't have soup inside, and have a thicker skin, but are also DEELISH!

3D problem:  

POS was crashing 3 times per hour

Solution:  POS issues will soon be resolved.

4th problem:  

Every Single appliance died in the first 5 days.  Dishwasher, Mixer, Griddle, Stove, Food Processor, Reach-in Freezer, Coffee Maker, Steam Table...seriously, "the Gods must be Crazy"

Solution: Everything has been replaced and/or repaired.

5th problem: Our walk-in refrigerator is a freezer..and we did not have a replacement freezer to hold the small quantitie of frozen items

Solution:  We got a new upright freezer and are converting the walk in to a cooler, tomorrow.  

It's really hard to stock-pile fresh made dumplings, in racks, without a refrigerated space.  Stockpiled dumplings had to go in the walk-in freezer, in morning, and then brought out, with enough time to thaw for cooking...very difficult.
 
6th problem:  Some dumplings looked like other dumplings, so orders got mixed up.  

Solution: we have made distinct shapes, skin color and cooking style, so no dumplings get mixed.

Thank your for your patience.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

New lyrics for my commercial:

Shine bright like a dumpling
Shine bright like a dumpling 
Shine bright like a dumpling....like a dumpling in the sky  (lift frozen dumpling towards the sky, and point)
Shine bright like a dumpling
Shine bright like a dumpling 
Shine bright like a dumpling....like a dumpling in the sky

You have to try the shrimp and chive today....
the ginger sauce will blow your mind....
and did you find your bubble tea okay?
The mango's great and peach sublime...

Shine bright like a dumpling
Shine bright like a dumpling 
Shine bright like a dumpling....like a dumpling in the sky  
Shine bright like a dumpling
Shine bright like a dumpling 
Shine bright like a dumpling....like a dumpling in the sky
