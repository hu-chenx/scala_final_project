Lynna Lai has found a new station to call home in Cleveland as she is joining Channel 3 News, anchoring the weekend evening newscasts and reporting on weeknights.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to join a news team which shares a passion for journalism, and being personally engaged in gathering the news,‚Äù says Lai.   ‚ÄúSometimes, anchors are perceived as being out of touch with the community, for never setting foot outside the station.  But Channel 3 is committed to hiring anchors who are reporters first, so I think this is a great fit."

‚ÄúLynna brings a wealth of experience to the table and will be a great asset to our news team‚Äù, said News Director Rita Andolsen. ‚ÄúShe has strong anchoring and reporting skills and is passionate about telling the stories of our community‚Äù.

Lynna brings 18 years of broadcasting experience in major markets across the country to the job.  Her aggressive career pursuits began as a reporter at WMBD-TV in Peoria, Ill., which was quickly followed by a stint at KGW-TV in Portland, Ore.  In 1994, she became the first Asian-American television reporter in Cleveland, but left to pursue anchoring and reporting jobs at WTSP-TV in Tampa, Fla. and WSB-TV in Atlanta, Ga.  She has also served as a freelance correspondent for ABC News and the BBC. Lynna returned to Cleveland television in 2001 as an anchor for WOIO-TV.  

Recognized for her energetic personality and storytelling abilities, Lynna has received two Associated Press awards for Best News Writing and Feature Reporting.  In 2004, she won an Emmy for Best Spot News Reporting.

Lynna was born in Chicago and grew up in Louisiana before her family moved to Northeast Ohio.  She is a graduate of Louisiana State University, where she was the recipient of the LSU Honor Scholarship and a National Merit Scholarship Award.  But home is where the heart is and Lynna has called Northeast Ohio home since her parents moved to the area when she was a college freshman.

"No one is happier than my parents, who are absolutely giddy that their granddaughters are staying in town." 

Lai‚Äôs first day at Channel 3 Monday April  16th., Face in hand, propped up with an elbow on the dinner table. Glazed half-open eyes. Cheesy grin. Slurred speech saying, "I love you guys..."

Drunk sorority girl?  Nah. It's my 2-year old who missed her nap!, I know it felt like November this morning, but this is ridiculous!
Every time I honked, they gobbled. In turkey, they were saying, "Screw you - we own this road!", null, Happy Chinese New Year! How to say "Happy New Year" in Mandarin Chinese: Gung Shee Fah Tsai (rhymes with eye), which is actually a  greeting that offers wishes of prosperity. A common, but less formal greeting is Sheen Nee'yen Kuai Luh, which translates to happy new year. The Year of the Dragon is said to be the luckiest of the Chinese zodiac, but also the most unpredictable! May you enjoy good health and prosperity this year!, While rushing around like crazy trying to get my 5 and 2 yo girls out the door...
Me: *Sigh* You guys are so much work!
Kayla(5):  Well, Mama - We are children... (in a like, duh! tone of voice)

What happened??! She just turned 5, not 15!, Sooo close...yet so far...so often.  Because actually tossing the clothes IN the hamper instead of next to it, is too hard for some husbands to do!  Ha! (uh-oh. I think I'm gonna be in trouble for this)  :), I think my husband likes the smartphone I gave him for Christmas, judging by this text I got from him:
Phil: If this phone were a woman, I'd be making cheesy one liners and buying it drinks. It's that good!

Really?! Boys and their toys!, How about some good news? A 5-year old Seattle girl attached a letter to Santa to 2 pink balloons on Dec.2.  It travelled 700 miles, and ended up in the hands of a Northern California rancher and his wife, this week. The couple is fulfilling her wish for a doll, tea set, pants and shoes. The Christmas spirit is alive!
        I hope you all have a safe, and Merry Christmas!!! :) Lynna, Off today. Kids in school. Went to bed last night at 9 - and just woke up. Wow. 13 hours! After 5 years of averaging 5-6 hours a night, it's finally hit me.  Apparently last night, I put the leftovers in a container and put the container (with the leftovers in it) back in the cabinet! cuckoo..., 4 years old, going on 40?  
Me: Kayla! Clean up your mess! 
Kayla: No, you clean it.
Me: Um, excuse me...I don't think so. Why should I clean up after you - You don't clean up after me.
Kayla: I will...(pause)... someday.
     
WTH??!!, The Occupy My House encampment. Protesters of veggies, teeth brushing and early bedtimes., Husband to our 4 yo, not happy about the cloudy gloomy weather: "You know, Kayla, you can still have sunshine in your heart, with all the love from me, Mama, and Carina." 
Kayla: "But if I have sunshine in my heart, I'll be too hot!", (Ok, someone's getting jealous.) Instead of all the Johnny Depp talk, what I *really meant to post was - Women love men... who are great fathers too!  ;), Showing this pic of Mama to my cranky/crying 4 and 2 year old girls always makes them laugh. Happy Friday!!, Lots of football watching this weekend. Husband: "Why do beer commercials all make dudes look like idiots?" Me: "You really want me to answer that?", Neighborhood's gone to the crapper!!, Party at Lynna's !!, Over the weekend, my 4yo, Kayla drew this outside picture. Kayla: "That's me...that's Daddy...Carina... a cat (which we don't have) and our house." Me: "Well, where's Mama?" Kayla: "You're inside the house cooking and cleaning." SMH... I really need to get out!, You guys were close! Shreveport, LA.  Congrats to my bff, Vicki!  My sister from another mister!, Another clue: Jambalaya, fried catfish and meatpies!, A clue as to where I've been this weekend!, I made chicken and black bean enchiladas for dinner. Mild sauce. But my 4yo, who can't handle any hint of spice, wasn't happy.
My husband: Girls: Say thank you, Mama, for making dinner.
Carina(2yo): Thank you, Mama for making dinner!
Husband: Kayla...?
Kayla: Thank you, Mama for making a terrible dinner!
Smh...we had to laugh..., OK Fantasy Football Geeks-Here's my team: QB-Sam Bradford; RB-Jamaal Charles; RB-LeSean McCoy; RB/WR Darren McFadden; WR-Mike Wallace; WR-Marques Colston; TE-/Chris Cooley;Giants D; K-David Akers/ Bench: RB-LeGarrette Blount; RB-Shonn Greene; RB-Joseph Addai; WR:Plaxico Burress; RB-Mike Tolbert; RB-Roy Helu; QB-Colt McCoy
