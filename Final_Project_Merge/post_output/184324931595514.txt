The only store in Boston sell shaved snow, #shavedsnow #boston #allston, At a fork in the road in Allston is a small café. The name of this café, Tealosophy, has many cultural connotations behind it. In Chinese, it is called Cha Zhuyi, meaning the philosophy of tea. In the summer, many young and hip students and adults alike come to this café to play board games, do homework, and catch up with friends, while a bowl of shaved snow sits in front of each table.
	Boston Summers are very warm but not dry, so walking outside is comfortable as long as you are not exercising. Maybe you will sweat a little bit, but once you step into Tealosophy, an air conditioned café, you will instantly feel relieved.
	Shaved snow is perfect for these summers in Boston. Shaved snow is cold, sweet, and refreshing, but unlike ice cream it is not too cold and freezing, nor are they greasy feeling. They melt in your mouth like cotton candy, except there are no small bits of sand or sugar within. Words cannot accurately describe how airy, delicate, and fine the texture of the snow is.
	The owner of this café grew up in Guangzhou, China, while his wife grew up in Taiwan. All of Tealosophy’s stock comes from Taiwan, even the taste of the shaved snow itself.   In year 2012, of which half was spent in Taiwan, the boss visited more than a dozen shaved snow suppliers. After coming back to the United States, he made many recipe improvements and was ultimately able to produce a recipe that maximized the flavor of the snow while maintaining and even making the texture far more delicate and light.
	Unlike ice cream, shaved ice, fried ice, bingsu, and snow cones, which all solely rely on the addition of fruit syrups and the like to procure flavor, shaved snow has different kinds of flavors in and of itself. It is airy, soft, refreshing, and quenches thirst, but it can also be eaten to enjoy the cottony texture like that of cotton candy. 
	Shaved snow is made up of thin, fine sheets of ice that are literally shaved off of blocks of flavored ice. It does not have small bits of ice liked shaved ice does, nor does it have a brittle texture like that of bingsu. It carries the taste of fresh fruit, and melts in your mouth, limiting the possibility of brain freeze. Because of this, you can fully enjoy the experience of eating shaved snow. Depending on the flavor of the snow, which are stored as small chunks in our freezer and placed in our snow shaving machine upon order, you can enjoy countless combinations. Dig into a bowl of snow with pearls, fruit jelly, fresh fruit, red beans, and many, many other toppings!
	The difference between eating shaved snow and shaved ice is where the flavor comes from: for shaved snow, it’s the snow itself whereas for shaved ice, the syrups and other add ons supply the flavor. For shaved snow, the level of the snow’s hardness must be carefully controlled; if it is too soft, the snow becomes too powdery and looks unfit to eat. If there is too much water, the snow becomes too dispersed like sand and the snow loses flavor. 
	Shaved snow is pretty healthy, and perfect for those who love cold, ice products because they do not need to worry about calorie and fat content. Shaved snow contains far less fat than many other ice products, not even reaching a quarter of the fat content of ice cream.
	Although Tealosophy does not appear very big, the décor is very refreshing and modern. Sometimes we will even have karaoke night, and people come to sing as they like! Others can continue enjoying their board games or talking with friends.
	Almost all Taiwanese people have heard of Yong Kang street in Taiwan – it is a very well known avenue offering some of Taiwan’s best shaved snow. Many others have seen the long lines of eager people flowing out of eastern Taipei’s shaved snow store – Ice Monster. Shaved snow has been very popular on the West coast of the United States, however there have not been as many shaved snow stores on the East coast. Tealosophy is Boston’s first shaved snow café, and the only one that offers authentic shaved snow in the area. 
	“My wife is Taiwanese and she loves eating shaved snow. We brought shaved snow to Boston, and are very fortunate to be able to do so.”, #drinkoftheweek #icegreentea #pineapple #refreshing #bostonbubbletea #shavedice #shavedsnow #bubbletea #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰❄️ #棉棉冰, #shavedsnow #shavedice #雪花冰 #綿綿冰 #波士頓唯一 #theonlyone #inBoston #Allston, #drinkoftheweek #icegreentea #passionfruit #refreshing #bubbletea #shavedice #shavedsnow #冰綠茶 #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰❄️ #綿綿冰, #drinkoftheweek #pomegranate #iceblacktea #refreshing #freewifi #boardgame #fun #bostonbubbletea #allston #bubbletea #shavedice #shavedsnow #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰❄️ #綿綿冰, #drinkoftheweek #strawberry #icetea #iceblacktea #refreshing #freewifi #bostonbubbletea #allstonbubbletea #bubbletea #shavedsnow #shavedice #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰❄️ #綿綿冰 #泡沫紅茶, #allstonbubbletea #refreshing #freewifi #boardgame #shavedice #shavedsnow #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰❄️ #綿綿冰, http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5OTA2NTcwMA==&mid=208944408&idx=1&sn=9bb7818b5997446cad8e480661fab7c8#rd, #drinkoftheweek #pineapple #slush #tealosophy #bostonbubbletea #bubbletea #shavedsnow #allston #freewifi #boardgame #fun #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰❄️, #drinkoftheweek #peachslush #bostonbubbletea #bubbletea #shavedsnow #shavedice #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰❄️, null, null, Come Join us - Open Mic Friday Night June 26th, #pineapple #icegreentea #drinkoftheweek #tealosophy #bubbletea #shavedsnow #allston #boardgame #wifi, #bubbletea #shavedsnow #allston #珍珠奶茶 #雪花冰 #tealosophy, #openmic #TEGMENTAL #tealosophy #wednesdaynight, #drinkoftheweek #icetea #strawberry #tealosophy #allstonbubbletea #shavedsnow #雪花冰 #珍珠奶茶, #TEGMENTAL #tealosophy #openmic #wednesdaynight, #tealosophy #TEGMENTAL #openmic #fun, #openmic #TEGMENTAL #tealosophy #wednesdaynight, #openmic #TEGMENTAL #tealosophy #wednesdaynight #fun #bostonbubbletea #allston, #drinkoftheweek#icetea #passionfruit #icegreentea #tealosophy #allstonbubbletea #雪花冰, There will be some special performances:
