A small fork, a nutcracker, and a plastic bib

While some people may use other tools, the three basic ones are a small fork, a nutcracker, and a plastic bib.  The nutcracker helps crack open the shell.  Some lobsters have soft shells and a person can crack and open it with just their hands.  Other lobsters have harder shells that require a nutcracker and some effort.  The small fork helps the diner get into the claws and joints.  The plastic bib protects clothing from lobster juice that squirts out while a person opens a lobster. 

Today's trivia Q&A via funtrivia.com, #TriviaTuesday
Eating a lobster can be an adventure depending on how hard the shell is and a person's lobster eating experience. What are three basic items most commonly given in restaurants and used in homes to successfully remove the meat from a lobster?, Today we recognize those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country so that we can enjoy our freedom. We also extend our gratitude to their families and wish them peace as they honor and remember their lost loved ones.
