Chart-Topping Duo to Be Joined by Adam Levine on Emmy Award-Winning Musical Competition Series
 
Platinum-selling and chart-topping duo R. City, with special guest and coach Adam Levine, is set to perform their hit single “Locked Away” on the live Tuesday, Nov. 17 telecast of NBC’s Emmy Award-winning musical competition series “The Voice.”
 
R. City is the musical duo featuring St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands-born brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas. In addition to being popular singers, the pair are also talented songwriters and producers, having written multiplatinum chart-dominating hits such as Miley Cyrus’s “We Can’t Stop, Nicki Minaj’s “The Night Is Still Young,” and Rihanna’s “Pour It Up,” among others.
 
“Locked Away,” from the duo’s debut Kemosabe Records/RCA Records album, “What Dreams Are Made Of,” has been downloaded more than 1.2 million times, streamed over 90 million times and hit #1 on the Shazam Worldwide Top 200 chart. It has reached #1 on Billboard’s Pop chart, #3 on the USA iTunes Top Singles chart and #5 on Spotify’s Global Top 50 chart. The hit song’s moving video was recently #VevoCertified with more than 100 million views.
 
“Voice” coach Adam Levine is the frontman for the Grammy Award-winning group Maroon 5 and has left an indelible mark on popular music. The primary songwriter for the band and a guitar player, Levine’s talents give Maroon 5 its signature sound. His heartfelt ballads and pop anthems have become part of the fabric of today’s pop music scene.
 
The band’s latest album, “V,” debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Top 200 and is a sonic summation of the group’s journey to date. The album’s debut single, “Maps,” set a record for the highest debut by a group on Top 40 radio charts in 18 years and has earned a top 100 spot in 18 countries. The music video for Maroon 5’s char-topping single “Sugar” has logged nearly one billion views to date. The group’s latest single, “Feelings,” is out now., This is a great cause we're passionate about. Help Destiny reach her goal!, James Valentine is taking over Live Nation's FB right now!

Saturday night's scheduled Honda Civic Tour concert with Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson at The Gorge Amphitheatre was cancelled due to severe, unseasonable weather at the Quincy, Washington outdoor concert venue. The decision to cancel was made unanimously by representatives of the artists and promoter Live Nation, solely in the interest of audience, artist and crew safety. 

"In 27 years of producing shows at The Gorge we had previously never cancelled a show due to weather. The decision to do so was not made lightly. It was only after careful deliberation with show production, artist management and venue management that this difficult decision was reached. The show was loaded in and the artists were on-site ready to perform. We all felt given the severe circumstance with the weather, cancellation was the lesser evil, rather than risking a serious injury to anybody at the venue," said Jeff Trisler, President of Live Nation Northwest and long-time promoter of The Gorge concert series.           

Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine appeared onstage to apologize to fans for the cancellation and he also took to his Twitter.com page to express his regret. He tweeted, "I'm so sorry we had to cancel tonight guys. We will make it up to you. We had to take safety into account. We hope you understand."

Patrons who purchased tickets to the show can receive a full refund by returning their tickets to place of purchase. Complete instructions will be available on Monday for those who bought their tickets at the Gorge Amphitheatre box office.

While most of New Orleans has seen strong recovery since Katrina, the Lower 9th Ward is still mostly a wasteland of grass and rubble.  It has almost no infrastructure in place - no police station, no post office, no parks, no restaurants and just one school.  The closest grocery store is an hour bus ride away, which means many residents are buying their "food" at the local liquor store, further perpetuating a downward spiral of health-related issues such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease.  

That’s why we’re supporting Aid Still Required's nutrition education program at the Martin Luther King Jr School in the Lower 9th.  Through hands-on experience through organic gardening, food science and trips to organic farms, students at MLK experience food from 'seed to table,' giving them an alternative to the diets they might otherwise inherit. 

Please join me in helping these kids get the right start -  http://aidstillrequired.org, Sao Paulo, thank you for an incredible last night in Brazil!! http://instagr.am/p/O5bntaREdm/, We love you too Rio!!
