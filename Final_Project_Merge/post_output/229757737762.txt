 the French baguette is on us tonite. We still have #chocolate #whiskey #cakes, True story:  going home we found a loaf of bagged sliced bread on the hood of our car.  Total mystery!  The label says it is Made from pure ingredients in a traditional and old fashioned way.  Then we looked at the ingredient panel.  See the top photo here. Since when is high fructose corn syrup and stearoyl lactylate old fashioned, traditional or pure?!  Our bread us made from flour, water, salt, and sourdough cultures or yeast.  See bottom photo.

Look halfway down under the James Parker Byline:, So I was just looking up something on Trip Advisor and noticed that Clear Flour is ranked #1 of 172 restaurants in Brookline.  Three comments:
1.  Thank you all of our customers for all the wonderful reviews!!  Much appreciated.  A real honor.
2.  We are not actually a restaurant (no sit down) so it seems a little unfair to all the fantastic local places here.
3.  To the recent reviewer who says "good stuff but a real rip off" please take heart: we do NOT sell croissants for 3.90 or baguettes for 4.00!  Never have. Croissants are 3.15  Baguette is 3.30.

More pretzels tomorrow morning around 10:30am., This is the baking great Quote of the month for me:  from local Baker Rene Khachadourianan in an article in the Globe.
 “You know what?” Rene said. “This is important. Although I’m 72 years old, I’ve never seen a loaf of bread come out of the computer. Somebody’s got to learn how to make food for the rest of the world.”  That's kind of how we are feeling right now; we need a few more bakers even if it comes at the expense of a few less people blogging about food and and making apps about it! , #paindemie #shapingtable #breadnbutter, We are so flattered and appreciative to see Clear Flour Bread cited in the New York TImes yesterday used (along with Tartine of San Francisco) as an example of  "influential bakeries" in America!

But we do need to correct their assertion that we are just into making breads like "flaxseed levain or a chestnut fougasse" and not white pullman loaves with "lofty, feathery crumb, and milk-sweet crust"  Actually we bake a lovely Pain de Mie twice daily, and we believe there is a place in the bread pantheon for all of the breads mentioned here., Employment Opportunities await at Clear Flour Bread!, Behind the scenes on Easter Sunday!
