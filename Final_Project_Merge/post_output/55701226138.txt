As you can see, we've used our accent furniture to create a beautiful bedroom display. Do they match? No. Are they hot? Absolutely. Here are some tips if you would like to give this look a try! 

1. Look to blogs like blog.vcf.com for inspiration!

2. Balance pieces by size. For example, a set of mismatched dining chairs can look outta whack if you don't stick to the same chair size.

3. Stick to the same family of colors.

4. Combine glossy with a matte finish in the same color. Like we've done in this photo. It gives a WOW factor!, Apparently sales were an emergency in the early 90's. LOL! I  picture flashing red lights and sirens! These prices are close to our prices today. Over 20 years later!

And of course we are doing special fan exclusives all weekend long, starting VERY soon! Can't wait!, It’s a PRESIDENTIAL TAKEOVER! Last year, our company president had a blast giving fans exclusive savings on furniture during Presidents' Day Weekend. He had SO much fun that our outside partners noticed- and now THEIR presidents want in on the action! But we said... only if you can give our fans some awesome deals. And they said, "We can do that!" We've been on the phone all day with our first partner- and they are hammering out the final details of the offer- and it is looking GOOD! We'll be announcing that later this evening. So watch the page!, null, A lot of you have been asking about the Paris. I just got off the phone with her, and she's hanging in there! She's definitely gone through a myriad of emotions today. First she was shocked by the breakup (she and the Valentino Sectional called it quits today. Read the posts below for more info.), then hurt, and now she's definitely perking up. She's looking forward to going to a new home. And that home could be yours! Email us at vcf.facebookfans@vcf.com by 11:59 PM eastern tonight. We will randomly draw a winner tomorrow morning!, It's a Blackout. And whenever we have a blackout, it means only one thing. Exclusive savings for Facebook fans only. Details to come. But if you know someone who needs furniture- tell them to like this page. The only way to get the deals is to be a fan! :o), And just when you thought it couldn't get any better. Something big is about to happen., I went downstairs to check on Paris, and she was crying her eyes out. (Isn't it heartbreaking. She went through a full box of tissues.) I promised her that we would find her the perfect home today. That she WILL get a fresh start. To forget about Valentino. That she will be with an awesome Facebook fan, and happier than ever. That cheered her up! For a chance to win her, just email us at vcf.facebookfans@vcf.com!, And here's the guy who broke her heart. I heard a rumor (might not be true, I'm just sayin') that he ran off with the Marilyn. I mean- come on. He could have waited 'til after Valentine's Day! Look at him- with all his cool accent pillows, and sleek look. He's one of those that just knows how hot he is. I bet he's going to be secretly jealous of the person who wins Paris' heart today., Happy Valentine's Day! You know who's not having a great day? The Paris Sofa. :o(  The Valentino Sectional broke up with her today. ON VALENTINE'S DAY! (They'd been dating for years... and she's heartbroken.)

Not a loveseat was stirring, not even a couch.

The stocking were hung by chimney with care
With hopes there’d be a Value City Furniture Gift Card in there.

The family was nestled all snug in their vcf beds,
While visions of savings danced in their heads.
And mom in her PJ’s and I in my cap,
Had just settled in on my American Signature mattress for a long winter’s nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprung from my bed to see what was the matter.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
He spoke not a word, but grabbed his bag and as fast as he was able,
Pulled out a bedroom, sofa, and a dinette with a table.

Merry Christmas from Value City Furniture!, Drum roll please.... instead of giving you a deal on one item, we're giving you a deal on whatever you choose to purchase!

Nothing was stirring…not even a leather couch.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care.
With hopes there’d be a VCF gift card hidden in there., When out on the roof, there arose such a clatter,
I sprung from my Vineyard Manor Bed, to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Dreaming of no down payments and buying furniture with no cash., With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.

He spoke not a word, but grabbed his bag and as fast as he was able,
Pulled out a bedroom, sofa, and a dinette with a table.
