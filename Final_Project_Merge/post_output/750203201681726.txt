Website: woodandfiremelrose.com, Great story!!! 

"For lunch nearly every day, he eats an entire pizza margherita. While that might not seem like diet-friendly fare, Cozzolino explains that his Neapolitan-style pies are not your typical New York slices. The dough is made from just water, flour, yeast and salt ‚Äî no butter or lard ‚Äî and the toppings are light ‚Äî fresh tomato sauce, a thin layer of mozzarella cheese and basil. 540-570 cal a pie! ", Where it all begins......fresh dough made daily., We have the cutest customers! 
Mac + Cheese anyone??, Great article!
