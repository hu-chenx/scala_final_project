The tradition seems to have carried over to today's lords as the "gold" daiginjo was the drink poured by Prime Minister Abe for President Obama at Jiro's during the recent presidential visit. This "Gold" Kamotsuru has been produced since 1958 even before the daiginjo category was created. It comes in a distinctive bottle shape like many of this brewery's sake. Not only that, inside are a pair of gold leaves which are supposed to bring luck when you drink them with the sake!
