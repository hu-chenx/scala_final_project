Booking for 2016 & 2017 #wedding #boston #nyc #worcesterma, Social media's some damn hard work. So not sure if you realize it but you really have to go on each individual social media to actually have circulation and relevance. You can use Instagram and share to Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook and Flickr but what happens is all those services view this new content as old content or otherwise un-fresh. So it doesn't promote it or circulate it as much. So between all those, Google+ & Pinterest it's a lot of work. I've been working on my focus on my social media accounts these past few weeks. You have to make sure most of your images are matching up with the other ones as well as your logo, title image and portrait if they let you have one. This allows for maximum recognition across the board. It's very easy to fall off the band wagon of all this.  #Facebook #Twitter #Google #Pinterest #Flickr #Instagram #Tumblr #Myspace #kiddingaboutMySpace, Shot this many many years ago while exploring some of the islands in Boston Harbor.  #Boston #dearisland #bostonharbor #massachusetts #noswimming #georgesisland #signage #worcesterma #unitymike, Flock of assholes at the Lucky Dog. #luckydog #flockofassholes #worcesterma #coverbands #bestofworcester #worcester #massachusetts, A trash the dress shoot from a few years back. #photoshoot #models #model #unitymike #worcesterma #trashthedress #dress #wet #worcesterma #marlborough, I have all the stuff to do one.

When you stay past midnight you get a brand new light show. The Eiffel Tower executes a small light show every half hour I believe for a few minutes. The yellow lights give out to hundreds or thousands of white lights that sparkle against the gold. After midnight is a bit different, the yellow lights disappear and are replaced with bright white lights that dance across the structure for over ten minutes followed by darkness.

I would slowly follow them, pacing myself and then scouting ahead for a location, slowly picking up the pace of my stride. I would position myself in a doorway or against a tree and unlock my len's zoom letting it slide down and out. I would crouch down or lean against whatever was there and slowly pull the camera up to my face focusing on a point somewhat equal to the distance my subject was. When I saw that my subject was at an optimal spot I would slide the camera over and take a few shots and then pull the camera down and look off in a similar direction of my subject to see if they had noticed and pretend that I had been shooting something else. While my camera came down I would review the photo and decided to move or take more.

Eventually I ended up with the following photo, slightly warmed up of course. The Boston Terrier just looked sad as it got it's collar adjusted.

Shot in Brussels, Belgium, While driving from Holland into Germany I saw this beautiful sunset. There were no shoulders on the road to pull off onto and whenever I had an option to pull off an exit I found the trees obscuring my view. Finally I came to a gas station and rest area. I pulled into it and turned and could see that the trees were blocking my view. I knew as soon as I pulled back onto the highway that I would be able to see it again. I drove up onto the highway and there it was, I pulled off into the grass and in doing so I got a sinking feeling. I turned the wheel to drive back onto the road and could feel the car sliding right down a small embankment. Cringe, my car slowly crawled back onto the road; now it's time for photos. I rushed back outside into the back of my Fiat 500L and pulled out my Canon 5d with my giant Sigma 150-500mm lens.

I'm unstoppable., null, So my recent trip to Europe was a blast. 11 countries in 13 days and around 7000km (Almost 4k miles). So I traveled down to the Eiffel tower with a guy from Atlanta and a gal from Venezuela. Our limited knowledge of the French language proved to be a blessing when dealing with the local immigrants that sell Eiffel tower keychains, five for a dollar. We had learned the phrases "Bring me bathroom" and "I am eating an apple" and whenever approached we would recite this with different inclinations in our voice. When approached we would also rub our stomachs and tell them in English that we're full and we've had too much. Eventually we were trying to get them to come up to us and routing ourselves to intersect with each member of this souvenir selling troupe. The Eiffel tower was still lit up in its traditional yellow lights with the fifteen minute light dance that it performs. At midnight the lights switch to dancing blue lights for around ten minutes or so. I shot way too many photos because I was shooting this without the aid of a tripod. This was shot with a Canon 5d MKII and 16-35mm II lens at F/2.8 - 1/6th of a second at ISO 1600.  I was laying down and resting my camera on my bag to steady the shot. After leaving and heading back to the metro we realized that it closed at 1am. We plotted our way back to the hostel and watched as French government troops swept thru one of the monuments opposite the Eiffel tower and cleared it of any remaining people. Eventually we flagged down a taxi and made it back.  Had a blast this time around in Paris., I know, $500 sounds like an awesome deal.  Too good to be true.... Check out my website.

Took awhile before I was able to pull over and take this photo but it was worth the wait. The roads here have crazy toll prices as well so i'm planning on taking my time over at each place instead of trying to cram in every place... which I could do. Today i've been to 3 countries already :), The leaning tower of Pisa. A huge tourist trap but still interesting to visit. Everyone taking photos with iPhones, iPads and if they could an iMac and also regular cameras (with flash on of course). Everyone was mooing the classic holding the tower from tipping over entirely. I was also muscled into giving a euro for protection of my car while pulling into a free parking spot from an African gentlemen selling umbrellas.

Glad I could help document this for the purpose of future teasing., One of my CyberSync triggers for my lights wasn't performing as well as it used to. The contact point that touches the hotshots wasn't touching anymore. I would have to push down on it or push it forward or backwards to create a contact. I packaged it up and sent it to Paul. C. Buff for repair. I was sent an e-mail from them informing me that they were not able to repair it because it would cost more to repair it than to buy it in addition to it being a small piece of equipment that they normally would do repairs on. So they said they would be sending it back, I wrote them and thanked them anyways, telling them how awesome their products were also. So today I got a small package back from Paul C. Buff and my returned CyberSync Transmitter. I placed the CyberSync on my desk, still sitting in a plastic bag with the original piece of paper that I sent. There was some writing on it, removed housing, adjusted contact point. I placed it on my camera in a hot minute and... they fixed it. What an awesome company. That just made my day.

I apologized to Jean Claude Van Dam (In my dream I kept using his full name in every reference to him), I told him that I had to swing home to grab my equipment and that I would be 30 minutes late (I said to myself in my head "it's not like he has anything to do").

I'm primarily a wedding photographer but also dabble in a dozen other areas of photography. So recently I got a mirror-less camera and it's much smaller and less intimidating than my big DSLR. I pulled out my camera and started taking photos of Mishka and he just laid there patiently while I took photos, the orange focus assist beam made his eyes close slightly and then the purring started. After each set of photos I would turn the camera to show him and with nothing else to hold his attention he laid there and looked over every single one. This is the first time in the five years of owning him that I got him to sit still for photos., Taken with my Canon EOS M mirror-less camera. I've had this little guy for awhile.

The area was a cliff that had a small walking path down to some exposed rocks and reefs. The What was interesting was that the trees at this small rest stop were swarming with bees, we hadn't noticed on the way in but took caution to as we left. No matter where you go in Maui from the side of a highway to behind a local store you'll find desensitizing beauty., It doesn't look like much but we actually drove twists and turns and roads that were as wide as a single car.

Later we all relocated to the Spencer Country Inn and all the details came down to their finality. The guys arrived and played around while they got ready and then joined the rest of the wedding party at the main building.

Lots of dancing and the food was amazing. Thanks again!, At the summit of Haleakala volcano., Hang-gliders waiting to launch off Haleakala last week.

The memorial moved to Copley and sidewalks and windows being repaired,  Boston bouncing back. Some of the arrangements were breathtaking and watching people take it in was sometimes tough to watch.

Today was just about taking a few photos to document the memorial. Joe Biden visited the memorial later in the day., Behind the scenes photo from the last Great Model Shoot v21.

A more relaxed police force and no military presence. I tried to get pictures of all the notes and cards that i could as well as the flower arrangements and sentiments left for the victims.  The main memorial on Boylston Street was gated off and had 3 crosses to the fatalities as well as tubs of sneakers, shirts and other things. I took a few photos there and headed to lunch with a friend who works nearby. Towards the end of my day i decided to backtrack to Arlington MBTA to hit the green line back home, why not grab a coffee for the trip? I swung inside a Starbucks a few buildings down from the T stop and ran into an MBTA worker who had visually and verbally scolded me the week prior for taking pics inside the Arlington station. I walked up to her and asked if she remembered me, I proceeded to show her the picture i took of her just before she approached me the week prior. She did remember me and proclaimed that she was just doing her job, we laughed a bit and I sent her the pic on the spot. I left the Starbucks and noticed a small white pickup pulling up to the main memorial on Boylston Street.  I quickly drank my coffee as i crossed the street. Placed the unfinished coffee on the ground and started shooting. The memorial was being moved down to Copley into a new arrangement. This effort was being afforded by two men from Boston's DPW. The men adjusted the gates surrounding the memorial to get access to the precious contents. Each man took an arms full of flowers and climbed into the bed of the pickup and respectfully placed it against the cab. The second trip was much easier for the men, while they were gathering a second arrangement of flowers sometime spontaneous happened. A half dozen people slid behind the barriers and started collecting the memorial and bringing it to the truck. A short few minutes later the truck was filled. A second truck was called in and this time over a dozen people fell into this small area and helped out.  Boston's DPW brought more people to help out on the second truck but it wasn't needed, Boston helped out., The sidewalk where the bomb went off being repaired.

It seemed like the entire police force was on duty Tuesday. Flowers were left at the barricades at Boylston Street as well as routine deliveries of coffee and drinks by strangers to the troops. Talked with a few first responders as well as some in the military that were on site, everyones still waiting for fresh news.

I shot it because it looked interesting and held some of the character of Worcester behind it., This is one of the first pictures I ever took with a DSLR back in 2006. I previously had made magic with what i now call throw away cameras (any camera around $100). This was shot in JPEG, not even RAW.... and no photoshop (I hadn't learned it yet).  This is Duchess, she is a mixed black lab. She's played like a puppy until she was around eleven old. She has since passed, she lived to be fifteen years old.  I took her outside and it was tough working with her. Everytime you got the camera focused and framed it just right, she would move.  Eventually she calmed down and i was able to time her movements and captured some really cool shots of her. I love you Duchess., This was taken just after the sun had set. This is overlooking the Greendale area from Indian Lake in Worcester. I live in a three decker right next to the highway. Some may not like living in a city or next to a highway but it has it's benefits. I get to hear a consistent drone of traffic which always helps put me to bed. It's also takers one minute to be on the highway headed anywhere. I also get to see the best sunrises and sunsets from the porch right outside my bedroom., Framing a sunrise is always the same for the most part. Put the sun in the middle, it is of course the focus of the picture. When you're at the top of a mountain and looking down over everything you're some what limited to your options. Some days you can really get lucky at the top of Manadnock. Some of the best days i've been up was when it was cloudy and reached the top above the clouds. This particular hike was done with Crystal Anson a local Worcester socialite. (She's going to love that i said that). Shot this with a 5d MKII and a 28-135mm lens. Hurt my knee pretty bad going down so it's going to be a few weeks before i'm back up to retry some new shots., I will be in Providence RI on Tuesday morning shooting Marissa. Evening is still free for anyone interested in booking me., Today before working a double at my day job I decided to join my friend Crystal Anson for a sunrise hike. We left Worcester around 2:30am sharp and headed for Jaffery NH home of the most hiked mountain in the world. We started our hike around 3:40 am on Mt. Manadnock and reached the summit a few minutes before sunrise at 5:15am. It was very windy at the top, but somewhat mysteriously warm. This is my 5th or 6th sunrise hike of Manadnock and it never gets old for me. The way down i forgot my age and was running and jumping until my knee reminded me that I'm not a teenager anymore. Can't wait to shoot this again with a 400mm lens or something equally as fun., Decided to do a sunrise hike up Mount Monadnock, can't wait to share the rest of the photos that I took., Going to recreate this sometime next week. I think i have a model but wouldn't mind to know who out there wants to try it with me? I took this photo last year., This is my grandmother. She still reads the paper, she's on facebook; she's wondeful. I shot this as I was leaving yesterday evening. She had no idea i was shooting her, I wanted to make sure i got a shot of her looking natural., Going to redo this setup I did last year. Looking for a model to participate., I can't wait to shoot with this prop and make an entire story with it. Any ideas?

I found this at a Marshalls. It's one of those glass balls that you place in a garden to reflect light. Recently i've turned to the idea of shooting with a theme or concept and decided this was a must have prop., This is Kim, she's not a model but carried herself like one during our shoot. Recently I borrowed a pair of pocket wizards to learn more about the strobist side of photography. I had the equipment but no model. Kim was gracious enough to meet up and model for me. Kim is a cook in a local Worcester area restaurant but obviously can do much more.  We shot this in a parking lot huddled beside the skeleton of Worcester Vocational High School in downtown Worcester. The effect in this picture was done with photoshop cs5. Simply using layers, curves, filters and of course my nifty logo in the corner.  Shot with a 5d MKII and 50mm 1.8 lens.  Please take the time to LIKE   unitymike photography's fan page and also feel free to visit unitymike.com, This photo is of Harley Quinn at East Park on Shrewsbury Street in Worcester. We climbed a tree and played around there for awhile and this is one of the images that really stuck. Harley is always a peach to work with. Behind every picture of her looking sexy or serious is another picture of her squinting her eyes and contorting her mouth and face accompanied by a silly noise. I had a blast. Photo taken with a 5d mkII and a 50mm 1.8 lens., Looking for lots of different roles for this event. People to help out with registration, interactions with families and also of course photographers. Please share!, Harley the detective. This is the model known as Harley Quinn. It's always a good time working with Harley .We were trying for a Nancy Drew theme of sorts. This picture was taken in an alley way on Grove Street. Shot with a 5d mk II and 50mm lens. Don't forget to LIKE unitymike photography on FB., Harley the detective. This is the model known as Harley Quinn. She's always a pleasure to work with. Always joking, smiling and playful as the name would suggest. We shot today around various locations in Worcester, Grove St. area, Shrewsbury St. & Main St.   Shot with a 5d mk II and 50mm lens.  Don't forget to LIKE unitymike photography on FB., Kim, May the odds be ever in your favor.   Photo by Mike Hendrickson of unitymike.com, Jeff & Nadine, Married in Shrewsbury MA last week. I met Jeff through a friend while shooting a wedding a year ago. I posted my pictures from that wedding and got a phone call to meet up and talk details. A few months later i had the pleasure of shooting Jeff & Nadine. The wedding was quick as most are. Their friends and family all seemed to have a really close bond with both Jeff & Nadine, very heartwarming. The decorations at the event were some that i've never seen before, i took note for my own someday. The reception was held at the Newton Marriot and was well worth the drive. Can't wait to share the rest of these images., Peppermint plant. I shot this on my patio. Natural light and a black towel underneath the plant and a simple adjustment in lightroom makes it look like it was shot in studio :)., This was taken at Seaside Sanatorium. This is the hallway of the dorms on one of the top floors. The colors in the hallway are due to the bright room colors that were painted for the children. Seaside has housed kids, geriatrics and the mentally ill. This was a great place to explore., The burnouts on Main Street, Worcester. All the people are sitting on the ledge over looking the tunnel where the burnouts take place. The smoke from the tires and the light piercing it being the backdrop to such a cool event. I took this a few years back but lost the original file. I can't wait to try and recreate this picture this July., The view from my apartment. This was taken just after the thunderstorm. I happened to be walking by my window after what I thought was already well into night time. I grabbed my Canon and ran out onto my patio and shot for a few minutes. Color hasn't been adjusted, adjusted the highlights and shadows a bit in Lightroom 3.     Shot with Canon 5d MKII with a 28-135mm - ISO 1000 135mm f/5.6 1/60th sec, Anna was visiting from Sweden and made a stop at Boston Common Gardens with me. We spent the morning into the afternoon walking around with her cousin, mother and aunt. They explored while I took pictures of her and her cousin every chance I had., Anna who is from Sweden is visiting Boston Commons in this picture. I had the pleasure of shooting her and Sophia this past Monday. She told me many times during this shoot "so fancy" (in a southern drawl).  I took this picture with a Canon 5d MK II with a 50mm 1.8 and Neutral Density 8 filter. Adjusted in Lightroom 3., Stormy weathers coming soon hopefully. Sick of this heat.  This photo was taken in Waterford CT right outside of Seaside Sanatorium., Band playing at Movies in the common. Very entertaining. The Luxury, Movies in the common.   Couple are more into eachother than the music, nice to see., Anna at Brattle Book Shop in Downtown Crossing, Boston, null, Will Raymond shot at a local urban farm in Worcester., This photo is of Harley Quinn at East Park on Shrewsbury Street in Worcester.  We climbed a tree and played around there for awhile and this is one of the images that really stuck. Harley is always a peach to work with. Behind every picture of her looking sexy or serious is another picture of her squinting her eyes and contorting her mouth and face accompanied by a silly noise. I had a blast.  Photo taken with a 5d mkII and a 50mm 1.8 lens., Where am I?    In this picture i'm in a steel pipe next to the Millbury Rail Trail. I went there recently with a friend to take pictures of some flower.  Playing in this hot steel pipe was more up my alley.  Flowers will have to wait for another day for my attention., Shot this in Douglas yesterday at an Abandoned Cattle farm. A few years back you could explore this old farm and poke around and climb and just get into trouble, but the good kind of trouble I guess. Recently in the past year or two all of the ways in and out have been sealed up and artists have painted everywhere around the property. Someday someone will break down a door and i hope to explore there once again., null, Boston Terriers at Katie's 5k Memorial Run in Boylston, Abandoned Train Tunnel in Clinton.
