A bird that stays awake when the rest of the world sleeps. They can see in the dark. I find that so interesting, to be mired in reality when the rest of the world is dreaming. What does he see and what does he know that the rest of the us are missing?”

"Let me say… When someone asks, “Who is your photographer crush?” I am quick to respond with Mary from Pebbles and Polka Dots Photography! I have admired her work for a long time! I loved just the moodiness and the emotion in all of her images. I had been doing newborn photography at this point only a year and deployed to Afghanistan. I would go to her blog everyday after work while I was over there… and just drool! They gave me something to look forward to that was something calm and gorgeous which was anything but what was going on around me. So one day I saw she had openings for her workshop I instantly called my husband and begged him telling him it could be my Christmas birthday any holiday that years gift to be able to go to her in studio fine art workshop in Boston. I had arranged plans to stay with my dad (Albany NY) and drive that morning to Boston. When I arrived… I was really early lol I was speeding thinking I needed to be there at 9 when I wasn’t suppose to be there until 930 lol I was so excited I remember walking up the stairs not believing this was true that I was about to meet my Photographer crush in real life. When I walked in Mary and her assistant were setting up they were really sweet. Mary went over how to set up my white balance (something as simple as that and without going I would have never known) There were so many things I researched and thought I knew prior to going and well… I was not even close. I needed this workshop. I learned so many things that I had total Ah ha moments!! Like how the heck was I having 6-7 hour newborn sessions. Her and her assistant… actually all the girls attending the workshop were so nice! We had laughs and great lunch. Both models were so good. Mary spoke about all her steps and workflow. Any questions we had she answered them. After posing the models she went into the editing which was really easy in my opinion. I didn’t want the day to end. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. So much I am attending another one in July!!!! Mary is really talented not only with posing newborns but just with the heart of teaching other aspiring photographers to be successful. The workshop just doesn’t end that day. Recently I was having a posing issue with my parent shots and I had asked her if she could give me advice again. She had me call her right then and there (which was 11 pm) so she could talk me through what I needed help with. I can’t say many would do that. She is amazing! I can now say I have been doing newborn photography for 2 years and you can see such a difference in my work since talking her workshop. That next weekend after taking her workshop I went from 6-7 hour newborn sessions (not including parent or sibling shots) to 2 hours flat including parent and sibling shots. I couldn’t believe it! If you have been a newborn photographer for a while or are just starting out you will not be disappointed in her workshop!! Just do it! There is so much more I would add to this but I don’t want to give it all away… you just really need to experience it for yourself and enjoy it! Thank you Mary for being you! You have really helped me grow and I can’t thank you enough!"

All of my family is in the area and the support we will get is most important. The house is amazing, and has a separate studio space as well.
 
WHAT does this mean for you!? Well, I am now booking sessions in CT for this Fall in the new studio digs here in CT and outdoors as well. I will also be sharing a studio space up in Worcester to continue with my amazing clients I have built such wonderful relationships with there in MA. I would never leave you guys high and dry! Luckily the new house is only about 45 mins away from the WOO! So the commute is pretty simple for me. 
I think that I am going to celebrate soon with a little Summer mini session kick off in CT for this coming Sept so keep your eyes open for that all you CT clients. AND MA you will have one too, I'm thinking August!! :) 

But seriously, I sit here now with my eyes welled up with tears wanting to thank you guys all for being so amazing, supportive, and loyal to my artistry. I am honored that I can support my family on this career and it is only because of your continued support that I am able to do so. Worcester is a place of love for me. Without you all here, I would have never had the courage to keep going. I have made so many strong friendships with clients, laughs and smiles shared, even to where I am checking out FB pages to see what their kids are doing daily. I truly care. Its amazing how capturing the love a family has intertwines you directly into their lives forever.  I look forward to what this next year brings, and I will definitely need you guys behind me to continue on with this new venture. I'm at a loss of words for what I feel in my heart for you. But definitely need to end this post, with thank you. <3, Photographers! I have an extra Canon 200mm lens as I just ordered another one and accidentally ordered 2! This is my go-to lens for all outdoor images, and it is what Meg Bitton Photography and I recommend to use at our workshops, and throughout your photography.

"Mary, I can not express in words the gratitude I have for the portraits you captured for our family. Your work is exceptional and your personality matches. We were totally comfortable with you and your assistant from the start, and the kids have asked us when they will get to play with you again. I was so impressed with the items you brought to the session, and felt bad that you both lugged them around the entire time all while keeping the kids entertained. I have plastered my walls with the photos from our session. I especially would like for you to know that you will be seeing us year after year as long as you will have us. Thank you so much for capturing the love our family shares. To me, its the most precious gift I have ever received.

He is one of my clients here at Pebbles and Polka Dots Photography and sadly, he has been fighting a battle with Leukemia and this week was sent home from the hospital as Carter is now terminally ill, the cancer is back... 

Treatment has stopped and there is nothing that can be done anymore for his illness.

I was called earlier by his family and will be heading to their home this week to photograph them all together and capture the love they all share. A treat I can not wait to give.

BUT we can all pull together and give him a life time of memories while he is still here with us. If you have anything to make his hopes and dreams come true, please help! 

Time is too short for Make a wish and Carter is also too young. As to have a wish granted you have to between the ages of 2.5&18 years old.. Please love this little boy form near and far and love his family Samantha Dan & Little Ivy ♥

Wreath halo from Mia Joy Studio, “There is, I have heard, a little thing called sunrise, in which the sun reverses the process we all viewed the night before. You might assume such a thing as mythical as those beasts that guard the corners of the earth, but I have it on the finest authority, and have, indeed, from time to time, regarded it with my own eyes.” 
~ Lauren Willig, The Garden Intrigue

Happy Monday all., One of our fellow photographers in CT has gone missing. Eric Langolis had a mountain bike accident this past Monday. He went pack to waterway to find his bike on Tuesday and has been missing ever since:

Eric Langlois is a resident of New Milford, CT who went missing Tuesday, June 11, 2013. He was last known to be at Lovers Leap in New Milford, CT. If you see him please contact the police. He has a wife and two children who want him to come home. 

New Milford police received a call from a woman Tuesday afternoon saying she'd heard a man crying for help. That set off the search.
 
Langlois' uncle, Peter Poulin of Danbury, said his nephew had "hit his head pretty hard'' in the accident Monday.
 
"We don't know where he is, if he is wandering around or if he fell in the water," Poulin said.

His wife just announced they are expecting their 3rd child on Christmas.

PLEASE, PLEASE, if you can donate anything to this amazing family it would be appreciated. Eric and Amber have a photography business which is their source of income. Please help this family as they continue in their search for Eric, father, artist and friend. 

My hopes is that they find him soon and return him home for Fathers Day.

Please click the link below. All proceeds will go directly to his wife and children.

It was a marvelous day full of fresh flowers, tiaras, glitter, jewelry, and all smiles from little Rowan. After the session ended, she kept hugging me over and over. Her little voice was the cutest I have ever heard. Her skin, pure white like a little doll. Blonde hair full of curls.

If you made eye contact with her, she would just smile. I have tears streaming as I think of it now. 

It's amazing how one experience can change your whole outlook and bring you back to what is most important. 

Please, say a prayer for Rowans parents and hold them in your hearts today.

This gorgeous little babe is wearing the perfect crown from Handcrafted Crowns <3

Backdrop from Roses and Ruffles, Got to the studio this morning for my last sessions in this spot before we move this weekend and WHAM, my door had been hit by crowbar and the studio broken into!! 

Thankfully I take the cameras home with me every night so those are safe and sound. They flipped the drawers and pulled canvas prints off the wall (police think looking for a safe), but shockingly nothing was missing! I think they only grabbed a handful of lifesavers from my candy bowl. I think they were looking for cash or a quick grab. Haha they must have been SO dissappointed when they realized it was all newborn hats, pretty baskets, diapers and a huge fabric stash!

My lighting is to darn big for them to run out with I guess. haha

Anyways, what a bittersweet ending to that studio spot. 

Onto bigger and brighter experiences with the new studio space, moving this weekend, in the constant of refolding our wraps, color coding the fabric backdrops, and hanging the newborn hats as we get orgnaized again. <3, Posting for the night crowd!

This workshop is already 1/2 full, make sure you grab a seat now.

Come spend three days with Meg Bitton Photography and I in NJ and capture your client unlike ever before.........

Oh, and eat chocolate too., When this little babes Mom first inquired about her newborn session she asked if we could do a shot with apples.

I of course said, "Oh yes no problem, I have a perfect little apple hat to use"

When they came in for their session last week, little did I know why. 

While Mom was pregnant, she had an obsession with eating apples during her pregnancy. We are talking 5-6 apples a day. Apple crisp, apple pie, sliced apples, straight from the fridge, and straight from the tree this past Fall.

And now finally, the apple of their eye is here. :) 

My whole studio filled with the smell of apples during their session. It was awesome........, And a smile to go with this beautiful girl <3 

Happy Tuesday everyone!

I received this message from my Yoga studio instructor and wanted to share, please pass it on:

Let's steal back this day from the commercialized industry who wants us to believe that this is a day for artificial chocolate we don't want to eat, overpriced flowers, or waiting for a card with words written by someone we don't even know. Let us know that real love cannot be found there.

Instead of holding our breath to see if someone remembered us, let us live as fully as possible in our wild, wonderful, wounded world.  Chalk a big pink heart on your sidewalk, go for a hike with your favorite pair of sunglasses on and let the sun shine upon you. 

Show someone how much you love them with a smile or hug or simple words straight from your heart. Snuggle your children. Walk your dog. Put fresh laundered sheets on your bed. Sing a song at the top of your lungs. Laugh until you hiccup. Refrain from feeling sorry for yourself or that the world owes you anything. It never does.

Let today be a day of being truly yourself. Eat food that you want and wear comfortable clothing that makes you feel most like you.  Don't judge yourself or others and appreciate all the people who come across your path even the crazies and the ones who are difficult. Aren't we all like that once in a while?  Fall in love with tomorrow. Be love-crazy with this world.  Even if only for one day.  One day is all you need.

Maybe one day is all we got., This was by far my most favorite newborn session I have ever done. I just ordered this in a 30x40 print for the studio. It puts me at ease when I see it.

I seriously would LOVE to do a few more of these full outdoor newborn sessions this Summer. 

If you are expecting, and are interested in having an outdoor newborn session in July or August in CT or MA, please email Mary at smilingtree15@yahoo.com. <3, OH EM GEE!!!! BOTH WORKSHOP DAYS ARE TOTALLY FULL ALREADY!!! I am SO SO SO grateful. <3

My jaw is on the floor., Here it is!! 

Email Mary at smilingtree15@yahoo.com to reserve your seat and create art with your Expectant Mamas <3, A perfect little prince. ♥
 
Newborn Crown from Handcrafted Crowns, Getting ready to release all the info tonight for the Maternity workshop dates! Keep your eye out for the blog link with all the info, I will post it here at 8pm EST!!!

I've decided to do 2 (one day) workshops in August! Only 8 attendees for each day to keep it personal and small, and an easy learning enviornment. I'm so so so excited about this and to meet all of you! So the first to email and send in deposits get the seats.

More info to come in a few hours!, Well, it looks like I am going to set this Maternity workshop in stone and announce, when, how much, and whats involoved tomorrow!!! The info will go up at 8pm EST tomorrow evening.

ONE question before I figure out all the details:

Would you all rather have a 2 day workshop that is more expensive, or a one day workshop that is less expensive? There will be 3 models each day regardless (2 indoor at the studio and one in the woods) Gosh I love the woodsy Maternity sessions!!! 

Let me know what you prefer (1 day or 2 days) and whichever gets the most votes is what I will create! :), I have had SO MANY inquiries about my Maternity photos. I'm seriously thinking of holding a Maternity workshop this Summer in August here at the studio. How many of you would be interested in coming to Boston for a fun girls weekend to shoot in the studio and outdoors with some fabulous expectant Mama's? I would teach you all my tricks in making those Mamas-to-be comfortable to get those beautiful artisitc shots and over the moon with their Maternity sessions. If I get enough wants, I may just have to set this up! :), Ahhhhh we made it through the blizzard and still have power! YAY!

Trying to dig out now, looks like we got 28 inches of snow in total!!! And the sun is finally out and shining!

Happy Saturday! <3 Stay safe everyone - the roads are all still closed and the driving ban is up

Bunkering down with the hubby and kids, and planning to build a few snowmen and snow tunnels <3, Wow. 

Normally I love my colored images the most. But when I converted this image to b&w during editing today, my heart skipped a beat. I adore this. And hope this expectant Momma does too <3

A mother's joy begins when new life is stirring inside... when a tiny heartbeat is heard for the very first time, and a playful kick reminds her that she is never alone.

In memory of all those lost in CT this past Friday. <3 My heart is broken., So many newborns coming into the studio this week! :) So excited for all the newborn cuddles after the events that went down this weekend and how emotionally exhausting it has been. There is nothing better than a newborn snuggle to make it all better. <3, With all the devastation today in my home state of CT, this made me smile, and I want to pass it on for when your kids hear about this, it's a good thing to remind them of:
 "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.' To this day, especially in times of disaster, I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers--so many caring people in this world." -Fred Rogers

CT is holding a statewide prayer at 7pm EST for all who were effected by todays tragic event. Please join me in lighting a candle for them and saying a prayer for all the parents who don't get to hug their own child tonight. <3, Simple, sweet, and so so cute he was., Fuzz head <3

This little princess was full of dreamy smiles and never once did I hear her cry. She is very quite, and loved to just look all around. She was very aware that I was taking her picture, and when she heard the shutter she would turn her head right to the camera. Just amazing. I loved her gorgeous eyes, and her little spikes of hair on the top of her head. Congrats to this new fam of 3 <3, <3 black & whites......planning on tackling a few galleries tonight!, This gorgeous couple were so fun tonight. I just adored spending the evening with them.

I am totally looking forward to doing their Newborn session in a few weeks, and also possibly capturing the birth of their little princess-to-be <3 , It was so great to meet this family today and their new son.

Wrap from Alexa's Closet Fanpage, This little guy is such a dream. He was here in the studio at 10 days old, and now at 22 days old he came back for more photos. Since his mom has referred so many people my way, I offered up a free session to her and use this little guy as a model for some new props and a how to guide on using wraps (stay tuned). She said absolutely and thankfully the weather held up this am to get some great shots. I just love cuddling this little man,  he reminds me a lot of my 3rd when he was that small.

They are expecting their first child, a daughter anytime now. He is a firefighter, so of course I am so excited to pose her with him in uniform (eeek) once she is here. These two are so excited for her arrival, and to top it off I got to meet their 3 other "kids" as well. We even got a shot of all of them together! I am looking forward to meeting the little lady in that belly very soon <3, I just adored this couple today who are awaiting the birth of their first child, a son. He is due in October and I am so excited to dress him up in pumpkin wear! These two are so full of laughter, love, and just good energy. :) What was even more beautiful about today, was that her sister is pregnant too, so she came along so we could get some sister Maternity pictures and capture that as well. LOVE when that happens. <3 <3 I am so excited to meet the little boy in this belly, and wish these parents good luck on their future journey! <3, I just loved meeting this adorable family today. This little guy was so good, and was awake for a little while in the beginning, then after a quick snack, he got super cozy and was putty in my hands. His Dad is an avid hockey player so of course we had to get a shot of this little dude curled up in his Dads goalie glove ~ adorable. I look forward to seeing this little boy grow and catching up at the next session. Congrats to this new fam of 3 <3, Loving this princess crown from The Photographers Closet!!!, This little peanut was a dream today. She is so sweet just like her Mom. She was such a good little girl and let me move her around a lot, and never cried once. She loves being curled up, and once in awhile she would open one eye to see what was going on and then went right back to sleep. I was very excited to meet her as I just did her parents Maternity photos a few weeks ago. Congrats to this new fam of 3 <3, A peek into my prop stash....this is only 1/4 of my closet....thinking I need to have a prop sale again real soon :) The buckets and baskets are starting to take over!, I was so very excited to meet this little stud today. He just melted my heart with those dimples, puckered lips, and that light blonde hair. It was REALLY hard to give him back after we were done with his session. He definitely gave me baby fever! He had the cutest little whimpers, and was one of the sweetest babies to photograph thus far. I am so happy for this new fam of 3, and just love being around them. This little boy is one lucky babe. <3 , This Mom-to-be is not only expecting her first child (a girl) very soon, but also her husband to arrive home from Iraq with the US Airforce.

I look forward to meeting her baby girl in just a few weeks, along with her husband, and capturing this new family of 3.<3, Little Miss Molly was so fun to photograph today. As every woman, she knows what she wants when she wants it, but in the end, she settled right into my hands, and let me capture her true, most pure beauty. I just love her perfect little nose and lips. The long hair that runs down her neck is just precious, and those perfect toes. *Gasp* She was such a treat. I just love meeting new parents, hearing their love story (theirs is one of true fate <3) and watching them as a new family of 3. Congrats to them <3 , I had a great time today with this little guy. I feel in love with his round cheeks and dark curls.

Congrats to this new family of 3!, You know you are on newborn overload when you take up the opportunity to pose your own 3 year old.

Congratulation to this new family of 3 <3, <3......, I was so ecstatic to finally meet this little girl today. I did her Mom's Maternity photos and was awaiting the day for her Newborn photos to come! At last I got to meet her, and it was well worth the wait. This 7 week old blew me away with what she allowed me to do to her and slept right through it. (YAY!) Not a typical Newborn session as she was so old, but her photos came out amazing!! I really look forward to watching her grow as her parents also signed her up for my Baby's First Year package I offer. See you in a few months Valentina! <3 that name!!, I was so excited to meet this little girl today and spend the afternoon with her down in CT.

It takes the pressure off of your husband to capture everything, and to have all of you in the photos together.....Here is an example of one I did last year., It was so great spending this evening with this couple who are expecting their first child, a daughter. They were so easy going and fun to talk with. Luckily they have a lot of beautiful property owned by their family, and I got a small tour of some super stunning areas.

I just simply can not wait to meet their new little man in a few weeks. <3, It's winner time!!!! Hope it's YOU!!!, I was so happy to see this little man again today. I did his Newborn photos 3 months ago, and was excited to see how big he got since. He has the most chunky cheeks and cutest little grin ever.
