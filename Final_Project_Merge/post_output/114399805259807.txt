By the 1980s, he was exhibiting his neo-expressionist paintings in galleries and museums internationally. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992., Posted with my Canadian/African connect.

Painting by: Lennox Commissiong 🎨 WORK STATEMENT: Expanding a bit on the image chosen and why. As you know Tupac was different things to different people, to some a sinner, some a saint. My focus is to capture both sides of the dichotomy. The background image of him in speaks to him being a messenger of his times, with equal importance (to some) as a messiah. Some even subscribe to the idea of the 'sacrifical similarity' while others say just another thug... Both men had the interest of the common downtrodden man at heart, tupac spoke to his masses using a manner with which they could connect. Behind the seriousness and confrontational lyrics, there was another tupac, the artist, the poet, the quiet contemplative moments. The use of color on a 'serious' image, allows me to give asnapshot of one of the serious thinkers of our generation, capturing the totality of his being. When all is said and done... in the contemporary world, especially in the world of the black youth, it is entirely possible that more 'folks' know the words of tupac. “for better or worse, not for me to decide... just laying the visual out there. (this work never been exhibited or seen by the public)Biography: Born in St.Vincent, WI, in 1958, Lennox Commissiong migrated to the US in 1972. He currently resides in Hisksville, New York. Commissiong is known for his work in varying media. Pencil, Acrylic, Pastel and Color - Aid Paper. Known for intricate abstracts, depicting carefully placed images that make up an overall theme and Ultra close-up portraits of Iconic Cultural figures as well as Jazz greats. He is greatly influenced by masters, Vincent Van Gogh and M.C Escher., About the other night !! Thanks @dussecognac and @rocnation for hosting this beautiful dinner.
