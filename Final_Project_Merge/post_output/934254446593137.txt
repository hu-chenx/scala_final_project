List(Our Front of House Operations Manager, Chris Hooper, is helping me out in the brewery today. Using those big muscles to stir the mash! Brewing another batch of Ruckus! for all you hop heads!, Come down to the brewery and try our newest offering. Introducing Isaac, our American Pale Ale made with heaps of citrusy American hops.

This beer pours a deep golden color with a small white head. Malty biscuit aromas mingle with citrusy American hops in this refreshing beer. Moderate malt flavors of biscuit and caramel seamlessly meld with judicious amounts of citrusy Cascade and Centennial hops to attack your taste buds, with a firm hop bitterness that lingers long into the finish.

Isaac is named after Captain Isaac Davis who led the Acton Minutemen into the Battle of Lexington and Concord. In this battle he was the first officer killed during the American Revolution., Cream Ale headed to the fermentor! Look for this to hit the nitro tap in about 2-3 weeks!  #nitrocreamale #drinkfresh #drinklocal #brewtruewest, Have you tried the Ruckus! American IPA yet? It may be our first IPA but it's easy to tell Russell has done this before! #MAbeer, Come down to the brewery tonight and enjoy a fantastic collaboration between us and Acton Coffee House! Tonight we have a limited supply (5 gallons) of our Irish Stout conditioned on whole Sumatran French Roast coffee beans from Acton Coffee House. Get in and get it while you can! #drinklocal #drinkfresh #ActonCoffeeHouse #coffeestout, http://www.beerco.com.au/blog/how-to-go-from-homebrewer-to-probrewer/

If you haven't had a chance to stop in and talk beer with True West's wunderkind behind the brew you gotta make it a point. 

Until then check out this interview with your very own Brewer from his time in Australia.  Gives some great insights into the method to his madness.  

Big Love!

Sl√°inte!, I made another batch of Brown Ale today because you guys are destroying the serving tank at an amazing rate! :) This will be ready in a couple of weeks, so you won't be without those mahogany suds. :), Hey fans of all things Craft!  

THANK YOU!

From the entire True West family. We are truly humbled by the overwhelming welcome to our village.  We are so proud of what we have all accomplished together in this first full week of great beer, great food and great community. 

We know we have a lot of work to do and we will continue to improve and evolve over the coming weeks and months. Please keep the comment cards and feedback coming - good and critical, we need to hear it all. And we are listening.  

A couple notes for all of you following us closely:

HOURS:  True West is currently open for dinners only, opening at 4pm Wednesday through Sunday.  This is purely a function of our staffing levels and preparedness. We would rather keep to tighter hours and delight rather than open for all meals and not do you justice.  Ultimately we will be open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner and brunch on weekends.  This will grow as our staff grows.  

MENU:  Wow!  Chef Helm and his team are killing it!  Our opening menu is somewhat abbreviated and simplified, again as we look to ramp and bring our staff along to achieve and maintain the quality you all deserve and we expect of ourselves.  The menu will also grow and change rapidly over the coming weeks and months adding our famous blackboard which will change daily and include the freshest, most local ingredients we can bring you. This also means it is not all online yet, but it will be very soon.

OUR SPACE:  We opened as quickly as we could, and as such several infrastructure items are yet to be completed.  Look for improved flow, acoustical noise reduction, better feet on the doggone stools and much more as we fix what you have pointed out to us.  

TRUE WEST BREWING:  Saving the best for last - Russell has absolutely destroyed expectations with our opening lineup!  Our First Batch Brown has been a huge favorite (as it tries to do its big brother, 7th Settlement's GABF Gold Medal winning 1623 American Brown Ale justice).  The Colonial Gold has been our gateway offering, designed to ease those that are new to craft beer into the fold. But still it is a huge success, bright, crisp and delicious.  We just put our seasonal Dry Irish Stout on for St. Patrick's and will be coming out with our first IPA, Saison, Smoked Porter and Pale Ale the next 3 to 10 days.  Ultimately you will see between 7 and 10 True West brews on tap at any given time. 

Again, thanks and we can't wait to raise a pint (or a SHARE) with you soon. 

Big Love,
