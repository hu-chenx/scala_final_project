Look for it in your stores around the 18th.

Made with unfiltered apple cider, roasted pecans and Vermont maple syrup; Maple Blend is chock-full of subtlety.

And I am literally about 5 steps from a virtually endless supply of cold, fresh pressed, craft cider.

And yet,

Something holds me back.  Could it be the beef, beer and digestifs  we consumed so lustily last night?  Or the multiple rounds of gin and tonics that went down so smoothly on Tuesday?

What am I worried about?  According to the Washington post I have quite a bit of room to run.  I suspect we all do.

According to the WashPo, a glass of wine per night puts one in the tope 30% of drinkers in the United States.  If you drink 2 per night, that puts you in the top 20%.

But the top 10%, (about 24 million legal aged adults) average 74 alcoholic drinks per week.  Or, roughly 10 per day.

http://downeastcider.com/buying-beercider-vs-buying-toothpaste-ode-lagunitas/, Is the Crowler (an alternative to the Growler) cool? We've been debating it here...If you don't know what it is, here's a short video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpTW54MrDjI, Better late than never.  In honor of National Puppy Day, a picture of Morty 4.5 years ago., Believe it or not, it is supposed to be a record high of 55 degrees on Thursday.  Sadly, it is the end of March and the only thing that truly excites me is the prospect of weather above the freezing mark.  The winter has that marvelous ability to play some sick tricks on you, lingering and stabbing you in the back whenever possible.  It is no surprise that I find myself huddled inside once again, longing for the green of spring and the humidity of summer.  Unfortunately, this cold hasn't allowed me to work on that picture perfect swing or get into the water too often. 

The hardcore New Englander would both surf and golf in the frigid winter, however, the snow has had a negative impact on both of those activities.  There is literally too much snow to golf and I think some courses might not actually open until late May (devastating), but they'll definitely be green.  

The surfing is a whole other story.  There are the winter warriors who vaseline their face and wear an absurd amount of neoprene to stay warm in hopes to catch a couple good waves before hypothermia begins to kick in.  In my years growing up on the North Shore I experimented with the winter surf scene and came to the conclusion that hour long ice cream headaches weren't for me.  Call me soft, but I grew tired of lying to myself that, "these salt flavored icee waves are going to be awesome."

With all that being said, I am excited to welcome spring back to New England.  It has been a long time since we've seen her show her face around these parts.  I look forward to the casual warmth, rain, and occasional perfect days that she brings with her.  In all honesty though, I am truly looking forward to being outside again, on a rooftop deck, at the golf course, or maybe even the beach.  I know it's New England and I am wishfully thinking, but it can't hurt to dream.

Here's to warmer weather and getting outside... once in a while!

Downeast Cider is doing a little thing with Area Four in Cambridge on Monday night (1/14). If you're in the area from 630-800 you should swing by for some pizza and cider. It's a $10 cover fee that provides you with an hour and a half of all you can eat pizza, (Mascarpone, House-Cured Pancetta & Roasted Local Potato), and cider

Anyway, if you're getting out of work around then and you're in Cambridge, it's a good deal if you like pizza and cider. They also do a beer/pizza pairing most mondays, and for ten dollars, its a really sweet deal. They've won a bunch of awards for having amazing food/pizza.

Feel free to bring friends, this is obviously a public event., a year ago: http://bcove.me/1fgq57zj, http://downeastcider.blogspot.com/
