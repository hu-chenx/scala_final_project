It is stellar!  You can only imagine what the 2009 is like if this is what he says about the 2010: Dark red cherry, plum, cinnamon and new leather notes emerge from the glass in a distinctive, medium-bodied Barolo. The 2010 stands out for its energy, balance and poise. Freshly cut flowers and tobacco linger on the finish. The 2010 is showing beautifully at this stage, especially if given a little aeration. Dried flowers and spices linger on the lifted finish. I very much like the sense of energy and intensity here. Grimaldi's Barolo is made from plots in Ravera and Terlo, and aged in a combination of cask and smaller French oak barrels., null, Cusumano Wine Dinner

We apologize for the inconvenience and hope we will all wake up to better news tomorrow.  #BostonStrong, Hard to believe it was only 5 days ago I was enjoying myself in the peaceful hills of Italy.  I can't imagine how it would have felt to still be there, while my children and family were home in Boston.  We are so concerned at La Morra about all of our friends, who have also become extended family.  

Everyone was there for us when we had our fire two years ago.  We received hundreds of emails from our customers and offers from restaurants around the city to help our staff.  It is our turn to be here for you.  We are devastated for The Summer Shack and for the family for the loss of Krystle.   Please let us know how we can help.

February 12th at 6:30 pm  www.vietti.com/en/

$125.00 5 course meal paired with the fabulous wines from the renowned winery Vietti

La Morra is named after the quaint town Josh and Jen lived in when they were first married in 1997.  There were many Piemontese friends who helped make their stay in La Morra feel like home.  Luca Corrado, from Vietti vineyards and his entire family, were some of those special people.  It was in his home that Josh learned how to make his infamous agnolotti from Luca's grandmother (who has since passed away).  When Josh and Jen travelled to Italy with DuVine bike tours, one of the highlights was visiting Luca at his winery in Castiglione Falletto.  You don't have to join their bike tour to enjoy Luca's wines or Josh's agnolotti!  Join us on Tuesday, February 12th for a spectacular wine dinner featuring Piemontese cuisine paired with Luca's award winning wines. We sell out quickly when Luca comes to town, so call today to reserve., Happy New Year!  So excited for Chef Josh's NYE menu! Come and visit!, COMMUNITY SERVINGS - Pie in the Sky

As the Holiday Party Season approaches, many of our customers ask if we cater parties.
The answer is...we LOVE to cater parties big and small!
If you're looking for a caterer, why not turn to your favorite restaurant?
 
From small at-home dinner parties for 6 to 20+ to holiday gatherings, weddings as large as 250 people...Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, corporate parties,
we do it all.  And we've been doing it since we first opened La Morra in 2003. Only now we're doing more of it.
People love Josh's cooking and they want to serve their guests some of the same dishes they've had here at La Morra.
 
While people know La Morra for its Northern Italian menu, specializing in cicchetti, wood-grilled meats, handmade pastas, and Josh's amazing Bolognese...
La Morra has also catered a variety of themed parties and will create any menu you want.
 
And although we are NOT a Kosher caterer, many area Temples recommend us because no one can do a better Kosher style meal like Chef Josh: 
And you don't have to be Jewish to like brisket and potato pancakes!
 
Basically, we will cater to your every whim. www.lamorra.com/packages.html

Five course dinner with wine pairing
for $85 per person
September 11, 2012
6:30 p.m.
 
 
Come join us for a night of food and wine from the region of Lombardy!  Chef Josh will be pairing the wines from the Ca' del Bosco vineyard with a five-course dinner that showcases this region's love of rich and hearty fare while featuring the leading brand of sparkling wines from Lombardy. 
 
If wine is art, Franciacota's masterpiece is Ca' del Bosco.  Founded when he was only 18 years old, Maurizio Zanella transformed the image of the Franciacorta winemaking district, where Chardonnay in particular reaches a specific ripeness, lending to a delicious concentration of flavors and aromas. Ca' del Bosco has been awarded over 20 Tre Bicchieri Awards (the highest wine ranking) from the leading Italian magazine on food and wine, Gambero Rosso.  Don't miss this chance to try some of the best wines in Italy! 
 

 From the owning family, Vittorio Marzotto will be joining us at La Morra for the dinner!

Monday, October 17th 
One seating at 6:30 PM $100.00 per person (including food and wine, excluding tax and gratuity) 

They say location is everything-a cultural maxim that operates in the wine realm as well as real estate. La Morra will host two winemakers, one from Slovinia, the other from Friuli, to bring you one extraordinary wine dinner. 

Students and winemakers around the globe study the techniques of Aleš Kristancic from the Slovenian vineyards of Movia and many visit him to observe and learn firsthand. His winery's vineyards occupy both sides of the Italian-Slovenian border. Kristancic, the current star of the Slovenian wine scene, is a storyteller, and like many good storytellers, he has a breezy approach to fact. Aleš will entertain you with his personality as well as with his wines. 

Our other honored guest is Paolo Vodopivec, from Vodopivec winery in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia winegrowing region, located in the far Northeastern corner of Italy. Paolo Vodopivec has earned an enviable international reputation for his distinctive expressions of Vitovska, a variety produced by only a handful of producers in the rugged Corso area of Friuli. No pesticides or chemicals are used in these wines. Instead bird houses have been constructed among the vines, allowing only a certain type of bird to nest and control insects and parasites depending on their location. 

La Morra is about to take you on a tour of these two wineries that you’ll never forget. You’ve had Chef Josh’s cicchetti, now see how Friuli can inspire his cooking. Really now...how can you miss Chef Josh cooking Slovenian food?, Received the best unsubscribe last night: "I'll be eating at your restaurant...just trying to save money right now for an engagement ring.

Reservations for dinner first:  www.lamorra.com/reservations.htm   or email me:  jen@lamorra.com
It is at an undisclosed location (very close to La Morra)...It starts October 8th.  Tickets will go fast as soon as the word gets out.  We are running a Blue's Bar inside the show (the bar will be your "escape" from the performance...if you can call it a performance).  
The Executive Producer from Punchdrunk likes to call it "a playground for adults where adults will remember what it is like to be a kid...it will break down all of their barriers."  They will do very little marketing because when they have put on these performances in London, they sell out as soon as they are announced.  Also there is the factor that it is again, indescribable! 
Right now the show is slated to run through December.   We have already started taking reservations for a pre-show dinner and will open our doors at 5:00.  
Josh and I have seen the set and we were completely wowed.
That's all I can say.  Let me know when you are going and if you want me to reserve you a table at La Morra first., Brunch is back this Sunday!
