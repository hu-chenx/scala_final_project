‚ÄúWe live nearby so we've been to Captain Fishbones quite a few times and have tried their dinner specials, brunch, random summer days on the water and random winter days at the bar. All solid experiences but last night really topped it for me. They hosted my husband's surprise 40th birthday and I was impressed by everything. The staff was great (particularly Maria, who patiently dealt with about 30 bar tabs!) and they were so flexible. They made it easy for me to enjoy myself at the party and not have to stress about the details. I got great feedback from all of the guests on the food and the location. Thanks, Fishbones!‚Äù
