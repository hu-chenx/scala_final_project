List(To our valued customers: We will be closed until further notice. There was a small grease fire that was contained to one piece of our equipment. We, however, have to have the establishment professionally cleaned, hood cleaned, and the building re-inspected prior to opening again for business, therefore, we cannot give an exact date of re-opening, but we anticipate and hope that it be within a weeks time! We are extremely sorry for this and thank you so much for your continued support!!!!!, Prior to this ruling, I am happy to say our establishment, The Proper Slice in Brighton, MA, had maintained between a 4 and a 4.5 star rating solidly for the last 3+ years. In the years to come, be forewarned that poor products/service may not necessarily be accurately reflected and thus kill the once highly trusted consumer site, for better or worse (depending upon which side you approach this situation). A 4.5 star rating on Yelp won't be as impressive in the future and certainly won't sustain as fodder for bragging rights in the business world anymore if this ruling is abused and exploited by Yelp...

COME CHECK US OUT! SEE FOR YOURSELVES WHY WE EARNED OUR 4/4.5 STAR RATING SOLIDLY FOR 3+ YEARS!!!
