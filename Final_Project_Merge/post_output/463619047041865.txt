You will be able to keep up to date with all of our specials :), Another amazing testimonial from one of our favorite families! This sums up what we strive to achieve every day when photographing and expanding our MamaRazzi Family!

To all of the Mamarazzi Ladies,
       Another session with you all and yet again I'm at a loss for words at the way you capture these moments in our lives.  A year after finding you for our maternity session I am still as deeply in awe as I was in the beginning.  You have never treated us like customer - but like family or a long lost friend - from the very moment we met.  You made me feel beautiful when I was bulbously pregnant, glowing when I was sleepless with a newborn (not to mention beyond patient spending almost FIVE hours to capture EVERY perfect shot), and the way you manage to capture Temperance's special faces takes talent you just can't find anywhere else.  I can't thank you enough for being there to photo document all of these special moments in Greg and I's lives.  Greg doesn't even mind being a part of the sessions anymore and was even excited when I told him we got squeezed into the recent beach sessions!  Lets be honest though, I knew you won him over by how comfortable you made both of us as nervous new parents and they way you so delicately handled our beautiful little refluxy baby - who was kind enough to leave her "mark" on just about every prop yet you didn't even seem to bat a lash at all the spit up.  Thank you again so, so much for all that you do for our family and we can't wait to see you for T's first birthday and all of our due dates in the future... Always, Kelly, Greg, and Temperance, Truly...... Everyone should know this amazing family <3, Our email went out this morning with all of our 2014 specials!!! Make sure to take a peek at all of the exciting things we have coming up 😜, So sweet and innocent <3, Sami, we hope you never change!
