How? We’ve constructed a micro-hydro scheme and two solar-powered irrigation schemes to provide water to communities, particularly for farming which is a major source of income for rural poor people.

Cornelius said: “I hope my parents will start to grow potatoes now that there is plenty of water being powered by electricity, so that I will be able to eat healthy. I study agriculture at school so when I grow up I want to be a farmer, own a piece of land here and develop my community. This project just came at the right time”.

#TBT #weare50, Today is Global Handwashing Day - a day dedicated to increasing awareness and understanding about the importance of handwashing. 

In Zimbabwe, good hygiene and sanitation practises are essential to help prevent the spread of deadly diseases. At the heart of this lies good old fashioned hand washing. A simple Tippy Tap made from local materials is an easy, effective way of enabling rural communities to be able to wash their hands. This simple technology, along with the knowledge of its benefits, can make a massive difference.

Khurda city, Odisha, has a population of 45,000. In its slums 94% of households don’t have a toilet. There is no city sewerage system and sludge waste collected from septic tanks is tipped into the public drains, causing blockages and flooding. 

Open defecation (toileting in fields, roadsides or by train tracks) is common. Women are forced to walk to dark and dangerous locations to find private areas to relieve themselves where they are vulnerable to attack. It is also a major public health risk.

Deep in the remote foothills of Western Nepal live communities of extremely poor smallholder farmers. Eking a living from inadequately irrigated lands and with little or no knowledge of improved farming and livestock methods, life is a constant struggle and malnourishment is rife.
 
In order to earn an income and pay for health and education costs, farmers desperately need to increase their productivity. Goats play a very important part for these small holder farmers, these hardy animals can withstand the harsh environment and their milk provides a vital income. Communities can better provide for their families and improve the nutrition for their children.

In North Darfur, the land is arid. With yearly rainfall only 600mm; the area is subject to billows of drought. Along with this, conflict has caused huge displacement, leading to the deterioration and destruction of what is left of the environment.
 
By planting saplings to create small forests close by, communities can begin to rebuild. These community forests can begin to rehabilitate the area by providing coverage to reduce desertification. The trees also increase the rainfall, helping to mitigate climate change, transforming the futures for these communities.

The call, made by more than 30 organisations across Asia and All We Can's campaign partner the Jubilee Debt Campaign, has also been endorsed by All We Can’s local partner in Nepal, Kopila. Mrs Bina Silwal, its Executive Director, stated:

“Kopila Nepal has been actively working to relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake and we have seen first hand the enormous damage to infrastructure, livelihoods with the loss of human life, as well as the psychological effects on individuals and communities. The extensive losses will set back development in Nepal by more than 10 years. Kopila Nepal calls on all institutions – particularly the IMF and Asian Development Bank – to recognise that Nepal should qualify for post catastrophe relief and cancel its debts immediately.”
