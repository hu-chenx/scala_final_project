Vegetable Stuffed Lemon Pepper Chicken

Roast Turkey, Recently, we have had a few inquiries about using the Level Up system.  This is something I am not going to use because:

1. My current Point of Sale system is not compatible with the Level Up System.  This means I have to buy extra equipment to set this up.
2. This leads to me having 2 separate point of sale systems.  I would have to enter the sales into my current one (for sales tracking purposes), then re-enter into the Level Up system. This essentially doubles my transaction time, and I cannot have that because it slows down the line.
3. The biggest reason: The cost per transaction through Level Up would be almost DOUBLE what I am paying now.  Definitely not worth it right now.
4. Cell phones distract customers and lead to misunderstandings.

Specials for Thursday, September 5th:

Roast Turkey
Chicken Teriyaki
Chicken Parmesan, Another PSA, this one concerns breakfast:

Breakfast is handled on a first come, first serve basis.  It is also made to order.  This means it may take some time for your meal to show up.  Staring, glowering, glaring, frowning, scowling, and/or displaying an unhealthy visual fixation toward the grill does not make your, or anyone else's food, cook faster.  Ohh and pestering the cook slows things down.  Distractions = loss of focus = possibly overcooked food = having to start over.  
That means if you come in and a bunch of people are ahead of you, be prepared to wait.   They are customers just like you.  Unfortunately this means you are no more special than anyone else waiting in line.

Thanks!!, So we are starting to transition to a more winter style menu.  Over the next few months we will be trying out some more comfort food type dishes, especially along the lines to stews, pot pies, and what not.

Just to let everyone know, we are closed Labor Day!!, For those of you who visit the deli regularly, you may have noticed that we have music playing.  We use Pandora Internet radio to keep us from hearing the same songs 19230 times over the course of the work day and giving us a mix of songs from the 60's to now.

However we have noticed a problem: any time a song from One Direction comes on, it gets played at a much louder volume than the other songs. Uncomfortably loud, which is only made worse because it is One Direction.  We don't know why this happens.  We apologize for this torture.  We have to endure it too, and are working to fix this before we gouge our ears out.  

Thank you for your understanding., Another beach day.  Probably going to be a slow day in the deli today.

Which is faster: credit cards or cash?

The answer is credit cards.  We recently upgraded the Credit Card reader (went from dial-up to IP based).  This took each credit card transaction from about 10-15 seconds down to about 3 seconds.  

It also took the average total transaction time from about 30 seconds to about 10 seconds (this includes cash and credit cards).

Also, the customer is (usually) quicker with a credit card because it is easier handle.  It also does take a bit of time to make sure the customer gets the correct amount of change., Ouch! It got chilly again today.
