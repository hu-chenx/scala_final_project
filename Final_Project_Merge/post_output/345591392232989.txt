http://www.dn.no/d2/2015/01/15/2057/Oslo/kunsten--slurpe, "The last reservation I made for a certain hot, new ramen-ya here in the city was, well, less seamless: 21 anxious calls to the restaurant, 20 fury-inducing busy signals, one short final conversation with a sympathetic hostess, one new name added to the wait list and one alternate plan to work out instead. But later on, by the grace of the dining gods, I got one more call: "There's a table available an hour from now." Workout canceled."

After two weeks of constant broth making with new equipment, purveyors, team members, teaching everyone, organizing and no sleep, we are finally figuring out the broth that came so easy for me during my pop up days when it was just me making the broth.  Thank you all for the amazing support.  I/we (Joshua and Heidy), take GREAT care in what we do.  We want EVERYONE to feel special when you come into our home (Mu Ramen).  

We really care.

Take a look at Mu Ramen's version of Okonomiyaki.  , "Noodles" are up!, Future site of Mu Ramen Harvard Square., The "noodles" are going up on the ceiling...so psyched!, Quoted from Adam Platt, New York food Critic:

"So are you excited to try these restaurants, or do you speak purely from a review standpoint?
Well, the excitement used to be a little more obvious. There used to be more noise surrounding certain openings â€” a kind of theatrical overture, complete with the banging of cymbals and the crashing of drums. But now, when I look at fall preview coverage, I really donâ€™t know what to think. I love Danny Meyer as much as the next devoted chowhound, but I find myself more excited about taking my daughters to the great new Filipino joint around the corner, Lumpia Shack, or to a place like Mu Ramen. Thereâ€™s a profusion of decent places to dine, but the ambitious, original, big-money gourmet operations are few and far between."

MU RAMEN The American fascination, and fiddling, with ramen has given us Ivan Orkin and now Joshua Smookler, whose background is in the dining rooms and kitchens of rarefied places like Per Se. With his wife, Heidy, he ran a popular pop-up behind a bagel shop in Long Island City this year. They are now opening a stylishly austere restaurant to showcase their noodle bowls and creative appetizers like chicken wings stuffed with foie gras. (Early October): 1209 Jackson Avenue (48th Avenue), Long Island City., Thank you FoodRepublic for the shout out!
