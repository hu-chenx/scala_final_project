Gaslight Brasserie

Mousse Au Chocolat

 

41/2 ounces Bittersweet chocolate (We use Valrhona 64%)

2 Tablespoons unsalted butter, diced

2 Tablespoons espresso or coffee

 

1 cup cold heavy cream

3 large eggs, separated

1 Tablespoon sugar

 

8-10 shortbread cookies for dipping

 

Combine the chocolate, butter and espresso on top of a double boiler with hot water not boiling and stir until all is melted.  Let the chocolate cool until slightly cooler than body temperature. 

Whip the cream to soft peaks, then refrigerate.  Next whip the egg whites in a medium bowl until they are foamy and begin to hold shape.  Sprinkle the sugar in and whip until soft peaks.

Stir the yolks into the chocolate mixture and combine with 1/3 of the whipped cream, then 1/3 egg whites.  Repeat until all is mixed.  Its important to fold and not whip this mixture.

Thank you in advance., Chef Keenan Langlois works the in's and out's of stuffed cabbage. A great side for many meat based dishes that you can make well in advance. 

Stuffed cabbage is a dish consisting of cooked cabbage leaves wrapped around a variety of fillings. It is common to the peasant cuisines of Europe and Western Asia, and has also found popularity in areas of North America settled by Eastern Europeans.  The filling is traditionally based around meat, often beef, lamb or pork and is seasoned with garlic, onion and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, eggs, mushrooms and vegetables are often included in the filling as well. In our version we will only be using vegetables as a filling agent.  Our this dish is featured on our Winter Restaurant Week Menu through the 28th as:

May we introduce you to the Croquembouche...
Here you will find our Frenchman, Keenan Langlois, constructing this masterpiece from the floor up (and by floor we mean countertop). [[[[[[ HISTORY LESSON...1547 when Catherine de Medici brought her chefs from Italy to France on the occasion of her marriage to the man who later became King Henry II.  Her chef named Panterelli had a dough recipe which became known as pate a panterelli, or Panterelli's pastry.  In the ensuing centuries the dough was changed and perfected until it finally became known as pate a choux (pastry for cabbages) because the puffs were thought to resemble little cabbages and were called choux buns.-------->In 1760 a French pastry chef named Avice filled the buns with pastry cream and called them profiteroles. -------->1801-1820 (it's a little fuzzy)  Antoine Careme  dazzled Europe with spectacular structures made of spun sugar, marzipan, nougatine and other sweet ingredients.  The croquembouche, whose name means "crunch in the mouth" is a rather simple version of his creations, and its popularity has spread from France to other countries as a different sort of celebration/wedding cake. Careme is said to have constructed his cake in the form of a Turkish Fez, rather than the conical shape we know, but he did make it with cream puffs, which are the basis of the cake we call croquembouche.]]]]]]]]]]]]]
Our recipe has been passed down from generation of french chef to generation of french chef and is kept has under lock and key of a man with a big french knife, but there are many recipes online.  Print one up and get ready. 
Crème Anglaise, Crème Chantilly, and Tuiles can add to the making of this dish, so if you are looking to prove yourself as a master of your domain and blow your guests away, print those recipes as well.

manager@gaslight560.com, Our Tres Chocolates Cake is a spin on the more traditional Tres Leches Cake. Four beautiful and fluffy layers or dark chocolate cake stacked by expert mason Chef Keenan Langlious using the lightest, milk chocolate mousse possible as mortar.  Mousse so light and airy that we had to top it with layers of cake just to keep it down. Mousse so delicious the only acceptable course of action was to then cover the rest of the cake in it.  After a little bath of cold the cake comes out for another coating, but this time it is some of our famously decadent ganache. Watching it be poured over the cake was.....an experience!  A more than generous coating makes its way on the cake step after step until finally its ready for a little dress. The combination of ganache and mousse folded together will do just the trick.   
-ask for the Tres Chocolates Cake @ Gaslight for your next special occasion, thursday night special: 1. Smoked White Fish Pate w/ pickled Radishes......2. Wild Striped Bass with Roasted Brussel Sprouts, and carrot puree, This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed at home.
This little piggy came from a farm in New Hampshire, and after being smoked for 10 hours, has a flavor that conjures feelings of home.  The pork consommé is just a thing of beauty and creates the perfect platform for this beautiful meat to perform on. The meat is tossed with some expertly cubed mirepoix that has been simmering in a red wine reduction.  Silicone molds in the form of spheres allow for a more than fun application of all these complex flavors, where a traditional terrine is used for the even more sultry creation using rabbit loin wrapped in bacon.
