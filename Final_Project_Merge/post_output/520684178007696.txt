Jammy blackberry, blueberry, and black current-great body!, GEORGE HOWELL THE NEW OWNER OF TASTE CAFE!!
I am thrilled
to announce the return to my café roots. On Monday, Laurie and I
purchased Taste Coffee House in Newtonville, MA, a suburb of Boston.
Taste was owned and operated by Nik Krankl, a superstar in the local
coffee scene! Nik built Taste into a first-rate cafe with a strong
reputation for good food and extraordinary espresso drinks in the local
coffee scene. We intend to maintain the food, espresso and service
traditions Nik so solidly established in just two years.We
teamed up early with Nik - foreseeing what a star he would become in
the local coffee scene. Taste has served our drip coffee exclusively
since 2008 and frequently offered our espressos in his rotating
espresso program. We worked closely with him to develop the signature
espresso blend, Cerise, that he competed with in the 2010 United States
Barista Competition, in which he took twelfth place! To learn more
about Taste Coffee House check out the website - www.tastecoffeehouse.com.
We look forward to continuing our creative relationship with Nik as he
moves back to his California roots and opens a second café in the near
future! We will take over from where Nik has left off. We will
keep with Nik's rotating espresso program and convert the drip coffee
program to the same level of excellence and diversity. In the near
future we will start a rotating drip coffee program - serving the full
range of George Howell Coffees, similar to The Coffee Connection's
style of small batch brewing. Freshness of brew will be key!  A bit
further down the road we will bring in single cup brewing as well.As
a buyer and roaster of the finest coffees on the planet our goal with
Taste is to have more face to face interaction with coffee consumers,
to learn from their feedback, and to have a venue to educate them about
our coffees and the many brew methods available for home use.  Getting
our feet wet with Taste is the first of many exciting plans we have in
store as we move towards opening a Boston flagship store in 2011. More
updates to come on our progress at Taste but in the mean time please
stop by and say hello! George H. Howell
