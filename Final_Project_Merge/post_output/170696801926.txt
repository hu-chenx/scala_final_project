#VNdesign, Sports Illustrated gave couple of reasons why Kobe Bryant's final chapter should be with the New York Knicks, not the LA Lakers.

"The only team that makes sense for Bryant is the Knicks, for obvious reasons. There is Phil Jackson and Derek Fisher, the triangle and the appeal of staying in a major market. New York is a bigger mess than L.A., if you can believe it, and first-time GM Jackson is aggressively looking to deal. The Knicks will have loads of cap space this summer and have a desperate need to be relevant. They have Carmelo Anthony, who has said publicly he has no problem playing with Kobe. Like the Lakers, they will likely have a top-five pick in June. Unlike the Lakers, they play in the Eastern Conference.

That‚Äôs the carrot. As much as Bryant wants to finish his career as a Laker, he badly wants another shot at the playoffs, to effectively go out on his shield. In Los Angeles, it‚Äôs a pipe dream. In New York, it‚Äôs a reality. As bad as the Knicks are now, the infusion of Bryant -- whose institutional knowledge of the triangle would be a huge asset to a team that looks bumfuzzled trying to play it -- and a high pick could be enough to get the 35-40 wins it takes to get into postseason."

#VNdesign, Kobe Bryant wanted to play with Michael Jordan

According to a Washington Post report on Monday, Bryant more than a decade ago wanted to leave the LA Lakers and play for Washington Wizards, where Jordan was winding down his career.

"That's true," Bryant told the Post. "A long time ago? Yeah."

Said Bryant, "I've always been very big on having mentors, on having muses, and I've been really, really big on that, being around guys who have done it before and done it at a high level and always tried to pick their brains and always tried to absorb knowledge. Obviously, being in that situation (with the Wizards), it would've helped having to be around him every day and so on."

A Bryant-Jordan scenario as teammates all fell apart when then-Wizards owner Abe Pollin parted ways with Jordan in 2003, a year before Bryant became a free agent.

"We would've put together a great team and we would've won championships," Bryant told The Post.

The trade would have sent the Lakers' Lamar Odom to the Hornets, as well Luis Scola | Scola4.com, Kevin Martin and Goran Dragic along with a 1st-round pick from the Houston Rockets. Rockets would've received Pau Gasol from the Lakers in the swap.

#VNdesign, How the Houston Rockets can land Carmelo Anthony?

#Houston would trade almost anything not named Dwight Howard and James Harden to get at Anthony and they would go all in on a contract too. There has been talk that Houston has offered up √ñmer A≈üƒ±k and Jeremy Lin in a "give away" trade that could include their draft pick in the first round or a roster player like Terrence Jones to get those salaries off the books.

If the #Rockets can find a taker for those contracts they‚Äôd go from a best-case $56.9 million in salary commitments to $40.2 million, which means $22.7 million in cap space. That‚Äôs more than enough for Houston to get into the game in a serious way for Anthony.

#VNdesign, Kevin Love reportedly wants to play for LA Lakers or New York Knicks

The New York Daily News' Mitch Lawrence reports that there are two cities that are drawing the superstar power forward's interest:

"Kevin Love's people reiterated to the Minnesota Timberwolves this past week that they had better trade him or else he'll leave via free agency when his contract is up after next season. With Love looking to exit, there's your No. 1 reason the #Twolves have not been able to find a head coach to take over for Rick Adelman. #Love wants to play for the #Lakers but he's also open to coming to the #Knicks."

#VNdesign, LA Lakers, Chris Bosh have mutual interest

According to Sam Amico of FOX Sports Ohio, #Bosh and the Los Angeles #Lakers have mutual interest in each other.

"I do think there's a possibility Bosh could opt out to sign with the Lakers ‚Äî but that admittedly seems like a long shot. I can tell you the interest is there on both sides. But will the Lakers have the cash? And would Bosh want to leave a real contender for a team that needs rebuilding?

The answers are yes and yes. Bosh would be a clear No. 2 man (behind Kobe Bryant) in LA. Being a star in #Hollywood is among the few things that supersede being a third option in #SouthBeach. But a lot of things would be in play here. First, it would mean the Lakers letting free agent Pau Gasol walk. No biggie there. Second, it would mean Bosh opting out of a really good situation. A little bigger deal. Third, the Lakers would have to find money under the cap for Bosh. With the deals they gave to Bryant and Steve Nash, a bigger deal still." - Sam Amico

#VNdesign, "I'm a free agent with no restrictions," Pau Gasol wrote. "That means I can go wherever I want. The LA Lakers don't have any bargaining rights. My franchise has the chance of offering me more money and a longer contract, but that's not all that's going to matter as far as my decision."

The impending free-agency decision has been on Gasol's mind for a while. The 33-year-old told NBA.com in December that he would be amenable to returning to Memphis, where he started his career, to pair with his brother, Marc Gasol, on the Memphis Grizzlies.

Unlikely superstar swap could aid #Knicks

"In his 1st attempt to be a front-office executive, Phil Jackson will need at least one player with an indomitable will to win, one capable of transforming the culture of an organization and a fan base that has become too accustomed to mediocrity and frustration. That player would be Kobe Bryant.

Jackson needs to talk Bryant into somehow joining him in New York for one last great mission in both of their careers: setting the table for the Knicks to win another championship.

One way that can happen is for the Knicks to work out the trade of all trades ‚Äî Bryant for Carmelo Anthony."

Odom shares an agent with Tyson Chandler, but that along with his prior relationship with Jackson won't by themselves be enough for the #Knicks to consider signing him.

#VNdesign, Despite growing up in Washington, District of Columbia, NBA superstar Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder wanted to play for The Toronto Raptors.

On Thursday, during an interview on The Dan Patrick Show, Durant said: "Believe it or not, I wanted to play for the Toronto Raptors, that was my favorite team."

Durant cited that one of the main reasons he grew up cheering for the Raptors was because of the Raptors' jerseys and the fact they were new to the league.

"They were a new team when I was growing up, so I wanted to be a part of that," Durant said.

Another reason Durant cheered for the Raptors was because he was a big fan of Vince Carter, Toronto‚Äôs former franchise player.

"His enthusiasm he showed, just his athleticism, and how he brought Toronto from being one of the newer teams in the league to almost going to the finals. He changed the culture there in Toronto."

"Over #NBAAllStar weekend, I'm told by a person with knowledge of the conversation, that Joakim Noah recruited Carmelo.

Now, you'll probably hear denials out of Chicago if they talk about it, because it would be tampering, officially.

But I‚Äôm told that Joakim said to Melo, "Look, you can go to LA Lakers. But if you want to win a ring, if you want your legacy to be about winning, come to Chicago."

Melo, I'm told, said, "Look, I've been watching you guys. I admire how hard you play. I admire how hungry you are. Oh, and by the way, my son‚Äôs favorite player: Derrick Rose." - Chris Broussard of ESPN

Assuming the #Bulls stay clear of the league office, they must clear even bigger obstacles to get #Melo. They'd likely have to amnesty Carlos Boozer and trade Taj Gibson ‚Äì unless they can convince Melo to accept less than a max contract.

#VNdesign, According to one report today, Kevin Love will either sign with the LA Lakers in 2015 when he becomes a free agent or re-sign with his current team, the Minnesota Timberwolves.

#VNdesign, Chicago Bulls ready to spend for Nikola Mirotic

The Houston Rockets drafted Nikola Mirotiƒá with the 23rd overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. The rights to that pick were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves and #ChicagoBulls before the night came to an end, giving the Bulls the rights to the talented Spanish forward out of Titograd, SR Montenegro, SFR Yugoslavia.

Mirotiƒá plays for Real Madrid Baloncesto in the Spanish ACB - Asociaci√≥n Clubes Baloncesto and has since 2008.

It looks like the #Bulls may be close to bringing Mirotiƒá to the NBA.

"According to most US based sources, it‚Äôs a given that Nikola Mirotic will leave Real Madrid, something we also consider a done deal if the Spaniards win the Euroleague Basketball Official Group, and the Bulls are ready to spend for the talented forward their mid level exception in a 4 years deal, which translates to a more than 20 millions USD contract for him. After 3 years in Europe, Mirotic is no longer restricted by the rookie salary scale and with this kind of money he can easily cover the monster 2,5 millions euros buy out his contract with Real Madrid includes."

Mirotiƒá, 23, is averaging 13.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.1 steals per game this season.
