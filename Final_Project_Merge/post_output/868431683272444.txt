Greco Bianco (or simply Greco) is an ancient, light-skinned grape variety originating in Greece and now grown throughout southern Italy. A tiny amount of Greco is now also grown in Langhorne Creek, South Australia.  Armed with excellent acidity and a fresh, clean, grapey flavor profile, Greco wines are best consumed young. They tend to oxidize in the bottle relatively quickly (within just a few years of vintage), resulting in nutty, caramelized flavors. Greco has sharp acidity, notes of apple and grapefruit, and a lemony palate. This medium bodied wine is enjoyable on its own and with light dishes.

Calabria is a wine region of southern Italy, jutting out between the Ionian and Tyrrhenian seas. 

Calabria is a rural region, its economy dependent on cereals, citrus and particularly olives. Viticulture and winemaking are far from the vital industries they once were. The local landscape is mountainous, and this has led to fragmented land ownership and widely dispersed vineyard zones. Without effective co-operatives, this can make wine production prohibitively expensive; the burden of purchasing and maintaining winemaking equipment is too high for most smallholders to bear on their own., Ehlers Estate Dinner Tickets are Selling Out http://conta.cc/17bvoyM, Wine of the Day. Tokaji Aszu. This sweet topaz colored wine comes from the Carpathian Mountains in Hungary. An Autumn harvest develops noble rot and allows for a higher concentration of sugar in the grapes. Tokaji has strong notes of honey and cinnamon and is a great choice for welcoming a sweet new year as Rosh Hashanah begins today at sundown., null, Today's Wine of the Day Selection is the Vespolina "Barbatasso," Monsecco - 2010 from Italy. Enjoy by the glass (100ml, 250ml, or 500ml) or by the bottle.

"From the Alto Piemonte in the small hamlet sized appellation, Colline Novaresi situated in the foothills of the Novare mountain chain, comes this Vespolina to charm the pants off all fans of Piedmont wines. Naturally high in acidity, this is a strongly assertive wine with cherry skins, white pepper and an intense minerality streaking through its roughened textured body. The wine's sweet ripe nose hides its complex, terroir-driven palate well. A wine meant for a meal, especially of game birds, wild onions and mushroom pastas. The grapes are harvested at the end of September into the beginning of October. The pressed juice then undergoes a seven to eight day cuvaison followed by a year of aging before being bottled and released to the market.", Yes, we WILL be open today for Labor Day, lunch and dinner!, $1 oysters now through 4pm, enjoy with a glass of wine at the bar, Juicy.
