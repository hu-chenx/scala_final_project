This month's pizza was inspired by fall and my last culinary trip to Naples, Italy. I ate pizzas several times a day, and wish I recorded the name of the restaurant that truly satisfied my "pizza tooth."  When I asked the pizzaiolo to prepare me a pizza that would make my trip to Naples memorable, he stretched his own signature crust and simply topped it with with panna (cream), fennel sausage, pepperoncino (crushed red peppers) and grated pecorino cheese.  When he pulled it from his inferno of an oven after about 2 minutes, he drizzled olive oil and sprinkled a bit of sea salt over the top. I was overwhelmed by the impact of the complementary flavors of chili, fennel, pork, olive oil, dairy and oven char.
 
It was this experience, coupled with the cozy culinary emotions that fall flavors bring, that inspired my creation today, which I call "Fall Inspiration".  Here's how you can build it yourself at Blaze Pizza:  Shredded mozzarella, Local fresh ricotta, Pork fennel sausage, Minced garlic, Shaved red onion, Fire roasted bell peppers, Fresh mushrooms, and Cherry tomatoes. Finish it off with Fresh basil, Olive oil, Sea salt and Crushed red chili.
 
Treat your senses by pairing the pizza with our Spinelli Montepulciano D'Abruzzo red wine.  This wine features the classic "thinness," that I enjoy so much about Italian wines, but also provides a light acidity that welcomes food and encourages another sip.

So close you can almost smell the pizza.., Behind the scenes with Chef Brad meeting the Pasadena crew on their first day of training. A sneak peak of the new store interior to follow shortly.., A note and recommendation from Chef Brad, concerning the importance of beer with pizza:

After working late at Blaze Pizza in Irvine last week, I decided sit on our patio to reflect on the day.  The unseaonble heat and humidity that night reminded me of one of my fondest pizza experiences from years past.  I reminisced about the week I spent with my native New Yorker-friend, Jamie touring Brooklyn pizzerias. 
 
We had spent an entire day getting on and off the the N, R and D trains and eating slices and whole pies from some of the greatest gas, wood and coal fired pizzerias in New York. We decided to call it quits on pizza for the night and stopped in a local (you guessed it) pizzeria for an ice cold beer.  That beer was a perfect end to that day's "pizza crawl." It was hoppy, ice-cold and had the perfect balance of malt to encourage us to share one more carb.  We couldn't resist ordering one of their crusty hero sandwiches that was toasted in the vintage Blodgett deck oven.  The light and crusty loaf was layered with Italian cold cuts, melted cheese and banana peppers. They added an unexpected peppery addition of arugula and fresh basil. 
 
I was inspired to relive this perfect gustatory experience and decided to head back into the Blaze kitchen to make a late night snack.  Heck, I had a hot oven, all the ingredients and my insatiable appetite.  The only thing missing was the sound and smell of Brooklyn in late summer and my friend's intense, passionate and well-punctiated conversation.
 
I knew that the Mission Amber Ale would more than refresh and hold up to the high expectation I had for this microbew to pair perfectly with my interpretation of this classic Italian sandwich.  Of course I folded the slices.


Beer:  Mission Amber Ale--Microbrew from San Diego, well hopped, earthy with a notable maltiness, lighly floral and a bit acidic
 
Pizza:  "Open-faced hero"--mozzarella, salame, pepperoni, banana peppers, kalamata olives, tomatoes, arugula and pesto drizzle, Have you had a chance to try our Blood Orange lemonade yet?

Doing our part to be respect the environment, because, after all, it's Mother Earth that’s providing us with all the amazing produce that goes into our delicious pies., Chef Brad tested over 20 olive oils before finding one that stood apart from the rest -- a blend of three types of olives grown locally in California.  After the harvest, olives are cold pressed and our extra-virgin oil is stored in air-free tanks to ensure the ultimate freshness.  Like our spices, this olive oil will be packaged especially for us when we order it, in an eco-friendly, recyclable bag-in-box., Blaze Ingredients Fun Fact: Did you know that our perlini mozzarella is sourced locally, and typically arrives in our kitchen just hours after it’s produced?  Now that's fresh!, Just finished up a visit with our spice miller, and although it has taken a few months to review all of our options, I am really excited about the quality we’ve achieved.  We are happy to announce that all of Blaze Pizza's spices will be milled fresh and to-order, then blended using our own signature recipes.  Sourcing fresh spices may seem like a small detail, but its little things that make a huge difference in the flavor of a sauce or salad dressing.  More delicious details and updates coming soon!  -Chef Brad, "Chef Brad here, Justin let me take the reigns on the page today so I can tell you about the dough recipe I've been working on.This is going to be made from scratch at each of our stores, and we tested over 14 different flours and almost 50 different recipes before we were satisfied.  To get it just right, we even worked with a miller to develop a signature flour blend exclusively for Blaze Pizza. I'm really exited about the recipe we ended up with – the perfect combination of crispy and “light-as-air”.   Can’t wait for you all to try it -- hope you enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed working on it. -Brad", Hats off to Chef Brad! His famed Margherita Pie from Olio Pizzeria is on the cover of the June Los Angeles Magazine! Can't wait for you all to taste his signature crust at Blaze.  You'll want to eat the slice backwards (crust first). -Justin, Another pizza sneak peek from our test kitchen.  This one's the LINK IN, with italian sausage, roasted red peppers, & red onions. For you healthy types, we are working on a gluten free crust (unbelievably good) and vegan cheese, if thats your thing., Chef Brad is busy in the kitchen today working on his Caprini salad -- a new twist on an old favorite. Perlini mozzarella, fresh basil and heirloom cherry tomatoes, with a balsamic drizzle. All in an eco-friendly Bottle Box. Can't wait to share it with you! -Justin, We couldn't resist sharing a sneak peek of one of our favorite pies so far -- the Green Stripe. It is fast-fired in under two minutes and you can either customize it to your liking or stick with one of Chef Brad's recommended toppings, like arugula, to top it off . - Justin, Chef Brad has been busy in the test kitchen at Chefs Center of California. We can’t wait to share his delicious fast-fire’d pies with you! In the meantime, we can share some pics of the fun we’re having. - Justin, Hi Facebookers, Justin here. I'm going to be hanging out with you guys on Blaze's Facebook page, answering your questions, and keeping you posted on Blaze news as we prepare to open our first store. So, I’ll start by confirming -- the rumors are true. Blaze Fast-Fire’d Pizza has signed leases in Pasadena and Irvine, and these first two will open this summer! 

Irvine -Open July 1 – University Town Center

Feel free to ask me questions, post your thoughts, and of course, discuss pizza. I look forward to the delicious conversations ahead!

Cheers,
Justin, We would like to introduce to you our Executive Chef, Bradford Kent, owner of Los Angeles’ top rated Olio Pizzeria & Café.  Chef Brad’s signature pizzas feature a “crisp, yet slightly chewy crust and delicious simple toppings.” We respectfully call him The Pizza Whisperer, and count ourselves fortunate to have him on the Blaze team.  Check out Barbara Fairchild’s (long-time editor of Bon Appetite magazine) interview with Brad last year. , Great bit of press from our friends at The Orange County Register's  Fast Food Maven. Thanks for the shout out! , It all started last summer, when we were craving pizza for lunch. No time for waiter service and a long, leisurely meal.  We just wanted some really good pizza.  Not delivery or a reheated slice.

We came up empty and ended up at Chipotle.  Enough said.  An aha moment.  The whole thing was sketched out on a napkin in less time than it takes to fold a burrito.  Or fire a thin-crusted pizza.

So friends, let’s officially launch this page by introducing you to Blaze Fast Fire’d Pizza.  We know you’re busy, so here’s the story in exactly 37 words.

Fresh dough. Pressed in front of you.
Artisanal ingredients. Inventive to classic. Custom built on the line. You decide.
Blazing hot oven. Fast-fire'd.
We're talking freakishly fast.
Less than 2 minutes. Less than 7 bucks.
Soon.

Stay tuned., null, null, null)
