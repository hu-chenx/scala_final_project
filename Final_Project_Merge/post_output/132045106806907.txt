#juicepress #ginger #immunityboost, happy valentine's day from the juice press family!, the senior beauty editor at ELLE Magazine (US)  discovers 10 surprising new ways to use rose water - swallow, soak, spritz, and more. here's what she has to say at about the newly launched infused rose water from juice press!  

"this most in first of all, a word about juice press's rose water. it's nothing like that fakey, soapy rose you might have come across in desserts (and some perfumes). distilled from bulgarian blooms, it captures not only the heavenly scent of the flower but also, somehow, the velvety softness of the petals. it's heaven. seriously. and it's good for you. the scent of rose has been scientifically proven to reduce blood pressure and levels of the stress hormone cortisol; it's even been shown to benefit the skin—and this is just from inhaling the aroma, mind you—by helping restore barrier function and natural hydration. topically, rose extract has validated anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties, and when taken internally, it might even be a fountain of youth"

@marcusantebi i don't know about your parents, but mine were the worst when it came to feeding me 'right' and teaching me about nutrition.  they meant well. they simply were not informed. the key component to optimum health is is leaving out the mistake of processed foods. contrary to popular thought you need far less protein than commonly taught, more calories from vegetation, raw if possible, and avoid dairy at all cost. believe that vegetation is the best source of all nutrients: vitamins, minerals, protein, carbs and fat. this is science, not quackery, not eastern religion or a hippy cultish concept., @marcusantebi Wishes heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of @WyattNeumann #wyattridesagain - wyatt's service yesterday inspires us that if you live life to the fullest you will leave a positive mark on many many people.

the debate over genetically modified organisms (gmos) as it pertains to the food system should begin with an understanding of how many processes commercial food growers have designed to alter food from its original state. those involved are slowly manipulating food so that it is not bio-identical to human chemistry, as food should be. there are so many things happening to foods before they reach our mouths. it is really troublesome.

gmos are just not worth it. the positive impact that can be argued for certain gmos pales in comparison to the immediate negative impact gmos will have on human chemistry, the environment and on other animals and insects with which we share the world., temperatures are rising today, stay hydrated! #juicepress #organic, we are proud to support City Harvest #skiplunchfighthunger campaign, providing food rescue services for new york's hungry! for the food truck schedule and for ways to donate, click here: http://bit.ly/1Etzxg4, there is evidence (including ties to the obesity epidemic) to suggest sugars that have been refined and isolated from their natural states lack the companion nutrients, minerals and antioxidants found in natural fruit sugars. the benefit of getting your sugars from fruit is that these sugars occur naturally and are believed not to have the same negative effect on body chemistry as refined sugars. here's more of our take on The Wall Street Journal piece on sugar labeling: http://bit.ly/1F4zYRu, happy mother's day to all you mother earths, mother f*#%in fireballs and every mother in between! #juicepress, super gifts for our super moms! our superfood bowls are raw, vegan, and gluten free. perfect gifts for mom this mother's day!, get up for run club! today 9am-noon, go on a run, post a photo to instagram with #jprunclub #juicepress and #willrunforjuice (photo must be posted 30 minutes before you go in store), show to cashier in any of our stores and get a free juice!, lunch game on point in the #jptestkitchen with our avocado toast with tomato, shiitake mushroom crisps, and truffle kale dust., it's friday! jp kids love the little green monster, a blend of apple, banana, strawberry, mango, lemons, spirulina and field of greens. enjoy every last sip!, morning run, done! rocket fuel packs in caffeine and antioxidants, giving you that boost to go the extra mile.

the advantages of cold brewing coffee beans are twofold. but first let me just explain what cold brewing is. with cold brewed coffee beans instead of boiling the coffee beans were taking the coffee grinds and soaking them in cold water for at least 15 hours it takes this long to allow the flavor of the coffee to seep into the water.

so why is this method beneficial to your chemistry? well first when you take something and you heat it up and then put into your system the warm or hot compound could penetrate your cell membranes quicker.  this is not always a desired effect when it comes to something like coffee - specially conventionally grown coffee beans that have all kinds of chemicals and pesticides. with your cell membranes being permeated faster because of the higher temperature , the effects of the hot coffee are much more stimulating - whenever you have a great amount of stimulation you have to have a reciprocal amount of negative crash at the end. that explains a little bit how hot coffee maybe too harsh on the body chemistry. the other negative of boiling a coffee bean is that the hotter you make something the more you alter it from its original molecular structure - in the case of food or beverage, the more you alter it the less compatible it is with your own chemistry. the more you shock the body the harder you have to work to restore homeostasis. (natural balance in chemistry)

the beauty of our coffee beverage is that our coffee beans are organically grown and we do not use anything processed to make our formulas! our almond milk is homemade and is not pasteurized or preserved with anything! when you drink a juice press cold brewed coffee and you avoid the chemicals and the dairy and the pesticides that are out there in most of the coffee beverages that exist you are doing a lot better for yourself. - marcus antebi, founder & ceo, it's my lunch & i'll eat what I want to., no hpp = a food or drink that hasn't been subject to high pressure processing, the cold pasteurization that prevents bacteria growth & extends shelf life.

while processed foods and refined sugar continue to wreak havoc on the american diet, animal protein, like red meat, poultry, dairy, etc., is not off the hook, with concrete ties to chronic inflammation, the precursor of most disease.

on the flip side, a plant-based diet has been shown to prevent aging and even reverse the progression of chronic diseases like coronary heart disease and certain cancers.

various studies suggest that “animal protein may significantly increase the risk of premature mortality (from causes like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes) by 75% (by as much as 400% for cancer 7 type 2 diabetes) for consumers who get 20% or more of their daily calories from animal protein.

unlike prescription drugs which are tightly regulated by the fda, supplements have long since been exempt from a stringent approval process, with many supplements labeled as “gluten-free” or “hypoallergenic” not living up to these claims.

determined to regulate the safety of herbal supplements and minimize fraud and quality discrepancies, the formulation of this coalition comes on back of last month’s new york state investigation into supplement label practices of mega-retailers of gnc, target, walmart and walgreens (all of whom were forced to pull questionable products from shelves).

as it is a long road to adequate consumer protection from a regulatory standpoint, these concerns speak to the importance of consumer exercising discretion in choosing their supplements, relying on trusted, organic brands for any diet supplementation., a new study published by the journal of the american medical association found that a vegetarian diet lowers risk of colorectal cancers (2nd deadliest cancer in the u.s.).

interestingly, scientists noted that “vegetarians might be protected from colorectal cancer not only because they eat less meat, but because they eat more plants.”

previous studies have suggested a correlation between meat-heavy diets and colorectal cancer, with findings here supporting this notion. observing a sample population of almost 78,000 people over about a 7 year period, vegetarians overall manifested a 22% reduced risk vs non-vegetarians. results varied among vegetarian subsets, with vegans demonstrating a 16% lower risk.

even accounting for some lifestyle differences in cohorts beyond diet, the benefits of a vegetarian diet persisted controlling for these factors including exercise, alcohol consumption, smoking history and family history of colorectal cancer., null, null, null, null, all your favorite hot soup flavors all the time! you can now find quart-sized containers of egyptian red lentil, butternut squash & quinoa, puréed cauliflower & mushroom, souper greens, & lentil mushroom chili in the fridge at all juice press stores!, out of crumbs, health rises on the upper west side. juice press is excited to announce plans to open a NEW location at 350 amsterdam avenue (between 76th and 77th)., sunshine & love me juice. this green apple, kale, spinach, & lemon formula is packed with 9 grams of protein., with various government agencies releasing dietary guidelines for 2015, serving-size recommendations and facts across various bodies do not quite match up. namely, fda labels on food packaging conflict with portion suggestions published by the department of health and human services and department of agriculture.

unlike usda and hhs guidelines that are revised every 5 years based on medical and scientific research, fda food label data are not, in fact, recommendations based on science and medicine at all, a detail little known by consumers.

while usda and hhs recommendations encourage consumers to eat a certain amount of fruits, vegetables, grains and protein (opting for language like cups or ounces rather than the vague term “servings”), fda labels actually tell consumers how much they typically eat.

the fda is in the process of updating these facts to reflect a more accurate portrayal of the contemporary american diet (read: oversized portions), with serving sizes sometimes double the size of those suggested by the usda and hhs.

ultimately, a healthy diet is one that is plant-based, consisting of real, whole foods, and nothing processed. until the general public internalizes this message, health hazards that stem from processed foods, refined carbohydrate and excessive animal protein consumption are likely to persist., photo via WellandGoodNYC.com.

several companies out west and one or two here in the east have begun to put charcoal in some of their juice formulas with the intention of aiding the detoxification process.

fresh raw juice alone is detoxifying and alkalizing without including an ingredient that has unproven benefits and is potentially hazardous in certain forms for most people.

not to mention just leaving out dietary mistakes has a positive effect on your chemistry.

charcoal may have occasional use for medicinal purposes, such as absorbing unfriendly bacteria, poisons and gases, but it should not be considered a health food. it is made out of peat, coal, wood, coconut shell, or petroleum and has no nutritional value.

if consumed regularly on an on-going basis, charcoal could absorb valuable nutrients, minerals and friendly bacteria and therefore it is best to consume away from food or juice, which is highly nutritious.

we cold press our juices to ensure the electrical vital force of the organic produce are not compromised, and do not include any ingredients in our juices that would rob the body of these nutrients.

Juice companies should not prescribe medicinal non-nutritional items and set them lose on the public at large.

Also the consumption of charcoal regularly can mask certain problems that individuals may have such as ulcers - charcoal is a very specific remedy used by knowledgable practitioners  who understand the history of the patient and the context of the charcoal use, ie., to treat gas.

nutritionist stefanie sacks debunks a number of these tricky food label terms. of note, most of these buzz words are related to animal-products. consumers should be mindful of getting organic animal protein from clean sources. vegetation is the cleanest source of all nutrition, including protein; limit animal protein to no more than three small portions per week.

1) whole grain / whole grain does not = 100% whole grain. therefore there could still be refined grains stripped of nutrients in your lunch without the 100% whole grain seal of assurance.

2) pasture-raised / a common designation on animal protein items (i.e. eggs, chicken breast, ground beef) without a verification system of any kind. sacks suggests that without a USDA definition, this term is basically meaningless.

3) cage-free / no verification process here, either. “cage-free” is no substitute for a USDA organic seal which ensures chickens are free of antibiotics and are not consuming GMO corn.

4) fair-trade / this term is about social consciousness, i.e. working conditions, fair terms and sustainability of producers, with little to no connection to the quality or integrity of the food product itself.

5) grassfed / the usda defines this term as “grass and forage being the feed source consumed for lifetime [of the livestock].”, our line of delicious hot soups is growing (stay tuned this week!). here is a jp original favorite - egyptian red lentil - hearty & warming., locked & loaded. starting this week out right., sunday morning shopping in greenwich., show us your run nyc! join juice press run club saturdays 9am-noon by going on a run, posting a photo to instagram with #willrunforjuice & #juicepress, show to a cashier in any of our stores & get a free juice! take the best photo & get more., studies show that americans will purchase 58 million pounds of chocolate for valentine's day. don't be a statistic. treat your love with a LOVE at first sight gift basket from juice press. complete with love at first sight, love me, lucky seven, pink punk and three desserts (made with raw cacao and organic, non-processed ingredients): chocolate love quest, the dating game and ebony & ivory. order via catering@juicepress.com., spreading the love in williamsburg., "getting sick before nyfw isn't an option. kill it with fire." you're welcome, New York Magazine the cut., juice press run club - grab a friend & a free juice. saturday between 9am & noon, go on a run, post a photo to instagram with #willrunforjuice & #juicepress, show it to a cashier at any juice press for one free juice!, without the backbone of FDA industry guidance, a mandated verification process, or uniform labeling standards, more and more manufacturers are opting voluntarily to label their products as “non-GMO” (even non-food items!).

some staggering stats…sales of non-GMO products exceeding $10 billion last year, outpacing even gluten-free category sales, and 80% of polled consumers (out of 30,000) willing to pay more for non-GMO foods. on back of data like this, it is no surprise that manufacturers across the board are vying to stamp non-GMO on their packaging.

while the non-GMO project (leading certification group in the united states) has verified 24,500 products as non-GMO, as many as 50,000 items in the average grocery store have the buzz words non-GMO or GMO-free tacked onto their labels.

we are obviously in the midst of a massive trend, with retailers from whole foods to trader joe’s taking steps to ensure their products are free of genetically engineered products, with the possibility of traditional grocery chains following suit.

while consumers have expressed the desire to know whether or not their food contains genetically modified organisms (which speaks to the debate ongoing in state legislatures around mandatory labeling of products that do contain GMOs), some are concerned that voluntarily labeling is clouding the waters to an extent. for one, there is the potential for non-GMO project seals to be confused with organic seals, which is a more extensive “assurance that food is grown without synthetic and toxic chemicals and in a manner good for the environment, as well as being non-GMO.”

some thoughts from juice press founder + ceo, marcus antebi, to learn his thoughts on this pivotal study:

"interesting article after careful review.

the friendly bacteria that reside in the gut will eventually, i believe, in the next 25 years be linked to many many many cures to devastating illnesses and illness of the future.

because the bacteria are actually you in the first place or were you in humans as we evolved many millions of years ago.

bacteria evolve like everything in the living world but evolve better outside the human host. when they return into the host they bring back with them new coded information about the survival of the host (you).

the bacteria are like billions of keys that unlock secrets.

there is no research i know of that is being done on what i'm speaking about but i believe that in in 20 years you'll read through dozens of papers about "good bacteria" being used to stop cancer, reverse alzheimer's, and much more.", run club street style. saturdays between 9am & noon, go on a run, instagram a photo with #willrunforjuice & #juicepress, show it to a cashier at any juice press for one free juice! take the fiercest photo & get more., enter to win #theperfectfit package: $3,000 to Moda Operandi, a juice press credit, 20 Flywheel Sports classes, + more from NUDE Skincare + Vogue! click below to enter:, juice press in-store events kicking off today! stop by 1296 madison ave (at 92nd st) this morning between 8-11, or swing by 1474 3rd ave (at 83rd st) between 1:30-3 / 5:30-7 for complimentary cleanse consultations, nutrition & cooking tips from our in-house health coaches, sampling new innovations from our test kitchen & gift bags with perks from wellness partners., black & white "milkshake" - juice press style. try mixing our signature jp black with our chocolate shake (non-dairy with raw organic cacao) for a healthy version of this classic favorite., food guru fred bisci shares some perspective on the study out of usc last week (https://news.usc.edu/63669/fasting-triggers-stem-cell-regeneration-of-damaged-old-immune-system/), where researchers conducted a human trial that suggests fasting for as little as three days has the potential to regenerate the entire immune system, even in the sick and elderly.

"water fasting is an unbelievable tool, but not something to be undertaken lightly. fasting is not starvation. fasting is the absence of the presence of food. starvation is when body starts to consume muscle mass and organs. one needs to be careful and make sure to be in the right hands under the right supervision. short term water fast of 7-10 days for most people are safe and tremendously therapeutic. for a person with cancer or suffering from certain serious illnesses, the effects can be miraculous.

even 2-4 days of water fast is tremendous. you increase the growth of new cells. this is something the body is trying to accomplish all the time, but people’s lifestyle - overeating, eating late at night, eating processed foods - suppresses the body’s ability to do so.

the body will also heal itself on a juice fast. you are accomplishing almost the same thing but it will take longer. it will take you 3-5 days to go into a fasting state, when the body starts to feed on (recycle) its diseased or dead cells. at this point the body would start to generate new cells though not to the same extent as on a water fast. this healing will still occur because the real culprit in suppressing this healing process is concentrated food. leaving out processed foods is the key.

juice fasting is a lot safer than water fasting with very few risks. you are drinking juice which is a very powerful alkalizer and contains all needed vitamins and nutrients. you have many fewer biological healing symptoms than someone on a water fast. juice fasting is the way to go for those who are not at a supervisory clinic. a lot of people drink juice and run all over the place, which is ok because you are getting vitamins, minerals and the proteins and fat from weight loss. but, if people were able to rest, close their eyes and meditate more during a fast, the healing results would be more dramatic.", you heard the woman: drink. more. juice., enter to win #theperfectfit package: $3,000 to Moda Operandi, a juice press credit, 20 Flywheel Sports classes, + more from NUDE Skincare + Vogue! click below to enter:, stop by 122 greenwich avenue between 8am and 1pm, and enjoy:

And vice versa. Your mind state effects your ability to strive to be more pure, clear, clean. Elevated.

If you were to completely clear someone's diet by force and detox all of their physical impurities, that person would likely panic. Or mildly put that individual may not be equipped emotionally to exist in such a physically pure state.

This is why we've spent a life time "intoxicating" ourselves with food or through food. We do this to insulate ourselves from feeling things in our childlike natural state. Foods are a powerful chemical alteration of our emotional state.

In the process of detox (which is simply a process of eliminating dietary and other input mistakes) the body and mind are never divorced from each other.

If your body is numb you will feel less and be less connected to your innate higher self.

If your body is pristine or as close to that as possible - I believe you have access to a mysterious universe of knowledge and creative power.

People with extraordinary force allow this superstar force to seep through even in a highly toxic physical state.

I am not preaching as though I live in some super 1960s hippie dippie utopian mind state. 

I struggle with this.

I have experienced this utopian mind state without drugs or water boarding or starvation a few times in my life and I therefore know it exists for me.

If I practice living in a more pure physical state I know this effects my emotional state. I haven't been able to let go completely because I'm not prepared to exist this clean.

Being vegan is not enough.

Cleansing and fasting are essential. For me.

Drinking plenty of raw No HPp organic juice is a huge part of this every day.

I need like at least 3 big juices a day minimum.

The juices are awesome in their transformative power.

I hope you all already believe this.

If we (JP) alter this juice in any way from what we do NOW -- we'll screw it all up!

The reason why this juice works is because of what we don't do to it!

All of our juices are pure and made with strict integrity and thoughtfulness. 

If Norman Walker, who lived 99 years or jack lelaine were both alive today (both juicing pioneers of the 20th century) they'd certainly be shopping at juice press and would lovingly promote my partners and I as the torch bearers of the juice movement of the 21st century.

We serve and stay closely connected to the young mr Fred Bisci who is another legend of the raw food and juice movement. He's a regular at juice press and that's a source of pride for juice press.

observing patients on a prolonged fast, researchers found that fasting triggers a regenerative response, kick-starting stem cells into producing new white blood cells,which fight infection. during the fast, the body "recycles" unneeded cells to save energy, ridding itself of "parts of the system that might be damaged or old" replacing these inefficient parts with brand new white blood cells.

the implications of these findings for cancer patients, in particular, were dazzling. first, a total rebuild of the immune system is monumental for cancer patients on chemotherapy suffering from damaged immune systems. remarkably, a extended fast was also found to reduce the enzyme, pka, which "is linked to aging and a hormone which increases cancer risk and tumor growth," and "protect cancer patients against the toxic impact of chemotherapy."

while more clinical trials are needed to substantiate these findings, the research here is truly groundbreaking and supportive of the pinnacle of juice press' philosophy, that the body is a miraculous healing machine, and if we are able to get out of its way by avoiding toxic foods and habits, it will do just that., hardcore superfood custom smoothie: coconut water, banana, blueberry, acai, e3live (a west coast lake-grown algae teeming with nutrients), spinach + kale greens booster, field of greens powder, maca & dates., null, null, null, juice press is served! office catering featuring cold-pressed juices, avocado toast, raw hummus wraps, & south of the border platter (chia guajillo chili taco shells with homemade guacamole, pico de gallo, pico del quinoa,  crudite, cashew sour cream, hot sauce, & jp zesty flax crackers)., stocking up with organic cold-pressed juices made fresh daily at our superkitchen in long island city., null, null, null, Lil Jon on his juice press: "special delivery from juice press keeping me healthy with fresh cold pressed juices." turn down for what?, null, the wayans brothers killed it at caroline's last night! hope mother earth helped Marlon Wayans feel his best for the show. our favorite joke of the evening: "the projects where we grew up have changed a lot. the liquor store is now a juice press.", null, congratulations to our friends at the Seattle Seahawks & New England Patriots on two epic wins yesterday. super bowl xlix will be one for the books as these relentless champions face off., null, give me a good bag of pre-washed organic romaine lettuce. throw together a Quick Salad for the 8 year old. chomp down a few leaves while the baby gets a baths. throw back our probiotic pills.

Their presentation focused on juice press' feasibility of opening in a specific new market they had researched as part of their project.
this is was a sophisticated presentation that taught all of us a lot about the business we love.
Their insight and understanding of our business was outstanding - they chose to work tirelessly on this specific project because of their appreciation of juice press and because of the challenges obvious in our space - thanks From team juice press for your hard work and passionate dedication. Marcus antebi - jp founder, enzymes. we live because of them. we produce them. some enzymes create things. others break things down. we eat them in foods.

pasta, a slice of bread, your system searches for both enzymes and vital nutrients in these foods groups which is mostly like searching for water in sand. -me again, VITAMIN AND MINERAL deficiencies will rob you eventually of precious time on this earth. - marcus antebi, jp founder, raw juice, raw solid whole produce, or raw blended produce; there are no better sources of nutrients for the "human-blob-creature". for us these are magical substances that bring to us life on an otherwise environmentally hostile habitation.

now, some people for a variety of reasons which i will not go into in detail here on Facebook, do not do great with some raw vegetables. like i said there are a variety of reasons. so what. gently and forgivingly cook the vegetables that you do not feel you do well with. sure that changes things a bit. its chemistry. right? liquid water freezes into ice or evaporates into a gas in either case when certain factors are applied to the substance. thats how chemistry works. 

if you cook a fruit such as a tomato, something has to be different about its composition and therefore its overall effect (not necessarily good or bad) on your chemistry.
just don't over cook your vegetables.

most vegetables do great baked or steamed.

precision diets need to be tailored to your unique chemistry based on a host of factors. any diet that has at its center the core philosophy the elimination of processed foods is mostly right and beneficial.

that being said high protein diets are asinine and excluded from the previous statement.

one factor that is often overlooked is that if you are gravely miserable on your diet profile, your unhappiness will effect your immune system.

happiness plays a role in your physical health. this is a proven scientific fact with data to support it. *merck medical journal 2nd edition page 7.

your diet should not make you miserable.

i love my diet. juice press made my diet possible.
my reason for starting juice press was "f$#ck this, i don't want to do the dishes or wash blender parts ever." thats how the concept to flight.

there are no need for extremes in your diet profiles. i am passionate about showing people what I've been fortunate to learn from several masters of nutritional science and a lot of experiential anecdotal science. these things have weight.

your body is a highly adaptive machine. you need to create reasonable dietary boundaries and live within them without deviating. deviation is a mistake. you can learn more about that in fred bisci's simple but wonderful book, "your healthy journey." 

although my vegan diet is considered extreme by some, its really not at all to me. its not necessary to be extreme, only in a few areas one must be black and white in my opinion. processed foods for example.

processed foods are the curse of mankind. 

they set my progress back in my childhood and early teens.

I REALLY WANT TO HELP!

I'm the real deal people. i live this mission to help the world fight their addictions to bad foods and dietary mistakes. i suffered so much as kid because of bad food. i suffered emotionally my whole life seeing my parents afflicted with obesity and other maladies related to lifestyle mistakes.

 i don't want to be a jerk or come off as preachy. I'm not. Your lifestyle doesn't effect me in anyway. So, I don't feel threatened or anxiety because of what others do. i am just a creative person with a business i love and I'm surrounded in all corners with people i love that encourage me to dive deeper into this experiment.

Juice Press is the test lab for a better way to sell food.

We can help a lot of people. You too.

We are the early adapters of the future of food. You too.

I discovered today in a discussion with these wonderful young adults that i believe FIRMLY that in 40 to 50 years from now, processed foods will be like contraband. people will have trained themselves how to use juice and they will rely on it. they will drink smoothies daily and eat fresh raw produce daily daily daily. nightly too.

probiotic supplements will be at the frontline fighting many human diseases.

i feel this deeply.

so we are only pioneers on a mission to push the clean food movement forward. you are pioneer if you live this way too. and the more people you tell and the more people that see your happiness and brightness, the better off we all are for it.

when i read something that denounces raw juice, i think, wow! that's really dumb. that person just doesn't have the experiences. then because I'm an opinionated schmuck i get really annoyed and think about the person who wrote it. they took the time to write something really dumb and then placed it into the world for others to crash into, dribble on, slip under, and fall over.

scholars once wrote the earth was flat.

in a study published in the journal of the academy of nutrition and dietetics, researchers found that participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study experienced a benefit whereas there were no significant changes in the placebo group.
 
those who ate only 22g of freeze-dried blueberry powder per day for 8 weeks experienced an approximate 5% decrease in systolic blood pressure and a 6% decrease in diastolic pressure, with levels of nitric oxide (the chemical involved in "relaxing and widening blood vessels") increasing significantly.

ALONG the lines of this thought is the problems with consuming too much protein: illnesses.

we don't need nearly as much protein as believed by many ill-informed educators. It's been known for nearly a century that on average people need no more than 20 to 30 grams a day. No more. Too much protein is the cause of many serious diseases. A knowledgable scholar would agree with my simple statement- they would prefer if I complicated it with deeper analysis and verbiage. But later 🎓

Plant based live foods are the best and most readily available sources of clean and easy to absorb amino acids (protein) - for example almonds, sesame, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds, soybeans, buckwheat, all leafy greens, and most fruits. Fruits supply approximately the same percentage of complete protein as mother’s milk. 
And the awesome nutrients such as vitamins and antioxidants that accompany the protein are crucial.
There are enzymes and minerals and phyto chemicals as well. 
Sounds like an impressive guest list to a party. It is. 

Why is this so hard to get this simple set of ideas for some people? Especially medical people and  I know many- they don't study that's why!! Hahahaha 🎈

I can't single handedly break the calorie counting obsession or the obsession with alienating oneself from raw fruit sugar - 

it is nearly impossible not to get enough protein from a plant based diet provided you have enough calories coming in from a wide spectrum of foods in the plant kingdom- they must be unprocessed and unrefined foods.

Also There is ample evidence from modern western studies that can be sited that prove food combining for complete proteins is utterly useless.

There is ample evidence showing that too much protein in our diets clogs the cellular system and makes protein toxic - to that burdened system -

Too much protein is part of the big problem of all these forms of cancers ravaging us with in these modern times where good food sources are so readily available - it's ironic.

Processed refined foods are the leading culprit as well. They are the true curse and scourge of mankind as one of mentors puts it !!

I'm not a genius or a discoverer.
I live this lifestyle myself and I 
research and stay informed. 

Using my own body as an example - at 46 I can train at a pretty high level, bang around in thai boxing with kids half my age, I'm as strong as an ox 
Don't see a difference from 15 years ago - and recover almost quickly. Maybe a tad slower. (I won't officially admit it to myself that I maybe slowing down yet. I'm slower because I'm not in fight condition or training at that extraordinary level.) 

I also know you can eat meats and flesh foods in small amounts infrequently and be extremely healthy- that's a personal choice
You can't eat meat foods every day however 

Dairy is a disaster - sorry.

I don't eat flesh foods and I'm strong as hell. I don't make muscle gains as a result of lifting kettle bells - I maintain existing structure well.

I've been observing myself for years in regard to diet. 

I use green juices as my antidote and fruit juice like doc green for instant energy -

I think the perfect breakfast anytime of the year is a raw superfood smoothie/

Our amazing fresh grab and Go salads can be mixed in a serving bowl with their respective dressings by our friendly staff. It take less than 60 seconds and mixes in the flavor of our award winning homemade dressings. 

This is a service we've offered since back when we only had one store - I am almost insistent you let us serve you the best way we can by letting us mix your salad next time you pass by, unless of course you don't have 60 seconds to spare. 

Ok - it might slow your grab and go experience down by a minute... But it's worth it if you're a salad junky like me. 

I don't think I've missed one day of eating at least one salad in 12 years. I can't remember exactly but Its a statement I will stand behind. 

You're welcome to stay in or have us just place the specially mixed salad back into its ready to seal container (no extra charge for the service.)

Our "pico de gallo" with a full tossing and a sprinkle of sea salt - hmmmmmm I lived on that salad for 18 months!

My old stand by is always "the marinated kale" never fails me!

And nothing nothing is as insane as chef Daniels relatively new "spicy Miso crunch salad"! Of course everyone has their favorites-

"For the love of kale", "kale Ceasar"

key findings suggest that certain probiotic bacteria produce bloating because of their “heterofermentative” nature. heterofermentative bacteria release gases (like CO2) in the intestines during digestion, particularly in individuals suffering from gluten or lactose intolerance. yes, that means that the probiotic you have been consuming to aid your digestive health might actually be the source of your bloating and related issues.

fear not; certain strains of probiotic bacteria are exempt from such unsavory symptoms, a distinction made in a recent cornell university publication. “homofermentative” probiotic bacteria do not produce gas during fermentation, and therefore, by definition, cannot be the source of bloating. among these strains of non-gas producing bacteria? glb44, the strain of the l. bulgaricus subspecies found in PROVIOTIC.

the icing on the cake, a study published in the new england journal of medicine indicates that probiotics containing l. bulgaricus may even relieve abdominal bloating (& potentially other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome). excitingly, these findings set the stage for continued scientific research on the alleviating effects of l. bulgaricus on bloating and related digestive issues.

Using a probiotic as an immune builder was suggested to me years ago by my food mentor @Fred Bisci, Ph.D. And I tried several times to get results - to no avail. I used to use vitamin C to squash symptoms and truthfully I think that works too most of the time.

while this regulation is a not to be overlooked as a step in acknowledging, if not combating, the obesity epidemic, a re-education about cutting out processed food must be part of the bigger picture strategy.

it is essential to bear in mind the quality of calories consumed. calories, sugars and fats from whole, real foods like fresh, organic fruits and vegetables, contain vital companion nutrients, as opposed to the empty calories found in processed foods.

while the fda (the administration behind the new labeling requirement) cited the goal of “helping consumers make more informed choices when eating out,” certain studies suggest that consumer response to calorie count publication is limited. one study suggested starbucks patrons reduced calorie consumption by only 6% when aware of calorie information., Haute Living New York features juice press in their lineup of the top 5 juice bars in nyc., juice press on the go with love at first sight - green apple, kale, spinach, & lemon., juice press cocktails bring new meaning to "gin and juice" (think - fewer hangovers). read more on New York Post., coffee or tea, we got you covered. our matcha green tea latte provides energy + focus and our lineup of cold brewed (far less acidic than hot brewed) coffees are sweetened naturally with organic dates and our extraordinary homemade almond milk and jp black formulas. calories + sugar from raw fruits and vegetables contain vital nutrients unlike those found in processed foods., our vegan, dairy-free blueberry cheesecake contains no processed ingredients, refined sugars, iodized salts, preservatives, or artificial junk unheard of by the pilgrims. our whole pies & cakes never see the inside of an oven! order them online at www.juicepress.com/desserts or in-store as a special order, 48 hours in advance., it's monday morning before thanksgiving. detoxify, energize, alkalize. enough said., atomic elements and their sources ( m. antebi)

fruits and vegetables must be ripe for the body to digest them properly. pasteurization of juice and food is a disaster—it alters their nutritional value and vital forces. chewing, blending, or lightly steaming fruits and vegetables releases the nutrients within the encapsulated insoluble fibers (wow, i sound smart). monsanto (the leading producer of genetically engineered seeds) engineers seeds in laboratories, which may or may not negatively affect the nutritional values of the food we eat. one thing is sure, it’s no longer natural. produce is rushed to harvest. non-organic farming practices that use a litany of chemicals are changing our chemistry. all this, combined with a number of dietary mistakes we generally make, means we are likely micronutrient deficient. these dietary elements support the biochemical processes in the human body. you don’t need large amounts—if you can connect the dots and leave things out, your body should be able to absorb and utilize the vitamins and minerals you are consuming.

one of the main causes of inflammation is lifestyle.  processed food is one of the main causes of long-term inflammation directly or indirectly. chronic inflammation is essentially the onset of most of our diseases, directly or indirectly.  briefly, lifestyle, diet and our eating habits and injury are the leading causes of inflammation.  processed foods, such as white flour and processed grains, all processed sugars, all sodas and carbonated drinks, coffee, alcoholic beverages, cold cuts and all processed meat products are acid forming foods of the worst type and leave an acid ash.  raw fresh vegetables and fruit, and fresh fruit and vegetable juices are anti-inflammatory and leave an alkaline ash, which is far better than acid ash which causes inflammation.     

the rapid introduction of fresh fruit and vegetable juices, with all its alkaline forming vitamins and minerals, and omitting all processed food and other foods rapidly helps the body’s immune system to neutralize inflammation - in most cases. 

when juice fasting, the omission of dietary fats and proteins enables the human body to recycle its own fats and proteins.  otto buckinger, a world renown german biochemist labeled this process "autolysis". otto buckinger fasted over 80,000 people in his lifetime.  he said that juice cleansing is a dynamic tool in restoring a healthy homeostasis in the human body. 

the power of a juice fast takes place when you omit all the things in your everyday lifestyle which have caused our body’s detox system to fall behind and start to create chronic inflammation.  when you leave out all the fats and proteins and all other processed foods, including the organic vitamins and minerals and the water that your body needs, your body will start to feed off the morbid materials and weaker and dying cells. 

juice cleansing is a dynamic and awesome tool at our disposal to help recreate a healthy equilibrium in our bodies on a cellular level.  it can help us avoid most of our diseases and slow down our aging process.  of course, this is a simple explanation to a complicated process.

http://www.juicepress.com/juices-blends/super-food-smoothies/healthy-ambition, "Dear Marcus :

As per your inquiry I want to restate my experience on detoxing and juice fasting:
 The human body is constantly detoxing.  This is a very important part of human physiology.  If we were to cease detoxing we would die of autointoxication.  

We detoxify through our bowels, our kidneys, our breath and our skin.  

Many people today, especially those on the standard American diet which include mostly processed food loaded with agrochemicals, pesticides with  excessive amounts of animal proteins and all the other intoxicants that come with the modern fast food lifestyle, will benefit from a juice cleanse.  When a person goes on a juice cleanse by omitting all the above and drinks fresh cold pressed fruits and vegetable juices, which are loaded with vitamins and minerals and enzymes, the body will go into a remedial response which is truly amazing and will start to unburden and heal  itself because of what is being left out. 

The energy or vital force that was used to deal with all the mistakes will be used to heal and become healthier. The  fats and proteins from our weight loss  will be recycled to supply the small amount of fat proteins we need for this process. The idea that juice cleansing is not safe is incorrect and shows a total lack of knowledge and experience in this subject In my own personal experience of more then fifty years I have never seen a problem when done correctly. Honest research with the likes of  Dr.Ragnar  Berg and Otto Buchinger two German world famous authorities on nutrition biochemistry and juice fasting will provide a lot of positive information.  

My own personal experience with juice fasting and athletics is extensive. Juice fasting is not only safe but has tremendous benefit in restoring ones health."

RANDOM SUNDAY THOUGHTS FROM A LAYMAN IN FOOD.

1. there is connection between the consumption of animal proteins and the level of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the body.  

This is a problem when you're eating processed carbohydrates that cause your sugars to go up, this will spike your insulin, for the majority of people.
that's when your body releases igf1 and 2.

To make matters worse people too much protein which is likely the best thing feeding cancer cells -

processed carbohydrates combined with too much animal protein promote cancer. in my opinion.

repeat:
higher protein diets result in higher levels of IGF-1.  Studies have shown that increased levels of IGF lead to increased growth of existing cancer cells.  Dietary interventions and modifications such as vegan diets regulate IGF-1 activity and have been associated with lower risk of cancer. 

the temporary positive effects that seem to follow a "paleo" type diet are incidental because those diets simultaneously promote the elimination of processed foods, in particular processed concentrated carbohydrates. so, for a short time, on a high protein diet without the processed carbs, most people see an improvement. 

NEW THOUGHT 
whenever you leave out the processed foods, you're going to survive, you're not necessarily going to thrive, but you will do ok.

NEW THOUGHT 
you really have to seek help OR guidance from doctors and medical people who understand bio-chemistry from more than one angle: (the scientific angle) - experience counts for something in medicine.

i meet too many doctors who will only follow "something" that has been proven by a "double blind study" conducted or a fabulous research paper done. This is expected and in most cases a good decision.

in other cases, it slows or impedes progress. I've met far too many doctors who do not know how to shoot from the hip and follow their own personal experiences and personal successes of people like me.

BACK TO PROTEIN 
i'm not suggesting in any way that people cannot be healthy eating a moderate amount of animal protein. that would be ridiculous.  

at the same time, we should think about the negative impact that too much protein has on our chemistry. it's like sunshine.
we need it to live, but too much of it causes us harm.
the exception here is that you don't need animal protein to live, you can obtain all of the protein and other necessary nutrients from a plant-based diets.

ON ANOTHER ALARMING NOTE 
animal flesh is loaded with phyto-estrogens and argo chemicals as well. these things can not be dismissed. and will be the topic of another ranting.

animal protein and animal fats are a very poor source of energy. don't be fooled by spikes in energy, they are always followed by reciprocal crashes. when anyone shows key tones burning up in their blood, they're burning fats instead of carbohydrates, which may not be an efficient way to go. sounds great if you want to lose fat. it's just not optimal for health and longevity.

lastly, let me once again mention the UNHOLY EVIL ALLIANCE which is processed carbohydrates combined with animal protein. in my opinion a recipe for growing cancer. in my opinion.
 <----processed carbs + animal protein ----> = get sick fast.

NEW TOPIC 
FRUIT, starchy and non-starchy vegetables are crucial for their nutrients. and most people do very well with these in a juice format.

the argument that raw juices are bad because the fiber is removed is not a universal argument for everyone's chemistry. there may be some validity to parts of the argument but not for the reason usually mentioned. remember, the juices are not meant to function in place of whole food diet; rather, they are either for juice cleanses or for supplements to a whole food plant-based diet.
REMEMBER juices have trace amounts of fiber which are the inulins and saccharides - juice is also a pre-biotic (food) for probiotics.

let's talk about orange juice.
a toxic person may feel light headed if they drank several glasses of raw orange juice or raw cold pressed grape juice, for example. but not always. and not only for the reasons of blood sugar level spiking. there are many factors that could make a toxic person feel badly if they drank too much raw organic juice.
the pasteurized orange is really only a sugar drink where they add back color and flavor, legally. it's no where near freshly squeezed oj.

THE DISCUSSION of why pasteurized juices and or HPP are better or worse than raw juices is now raging in my industry. 
it all comes down to the altering or denaturing the enzymes, destroying them in the heat or pressure processes. these enzymes are the key to life and the life forces in the juices. the juices are sterile and in my opinion this sterility reduces the juices' powerful positive, not negative, impact on our immunological systems.

and here's my newest discovery:

the heat pasteurized juices don't spoil in part because the natural enzymes, which would ordinarily ripen and then rot the fruit, are denatured. these enzymes effect your own chemistry's ability to balance the natural sugars effect on your chemistry.
when the juice has been altered in this way and it mixes with your chemistry and your digestive juices, it will effect you like a processed sugar. the vitamins may be intaken, but the effect on your chemistry may not be a positive - it won't be the same as with raw juice.
there's absolutely no "paper"or double blind study on this, but i assure you it's coming soon.

i don't advocate someone drink 32 ounces or 10 glass of oj a day.
someone drinking 17 ounces of oj in a day usually does excellent.
in most cases, even without the fiber, it won't spike the sugar short term or long term.
remember how much sugar you burn is related to how much you exercise. The more you exercise the more sugar you burn.

Again raw fruit sugars or sugar from starchy vegetables in no way should be compared to processed sugars. That would be stupid.

NEW THOUGHT 
if someone were hyper concerned with blood sugar, drink raw fruit juice mixed with green juices to lower the glycemic index or average the GI over the fruit and the greens. or when drinking raw carrot juice which contains glucose not fructose, if you are concerned, eat a few celery sticks if you want the fiber. or you can simply dilute your fruit or starchy juices with water.

remember I'm not advocating that people with disease drink fruit juices - I'm covering my back by stating that my beliefs pertain to normal and healthy people.

the juice is powerful and often we want this power. some doctors don't like it.

my experience has shown me that people with blood sugar level problems, insulin resistance, type one or two diabetes, actually do very well with raw fruit juice in the context of them trying to clean up their diets, they do fabulous with raw juices.....in my experience.
there are too many variables to make formulaic paradigm.

type one diabetics who burn a lot of calories through exercise are different than those who are sedentary.

some people do better with raw smoothies.
but thats mostly in context of a fast that includes mostly juice and smoothies.

new thought
the most ludicrous argument I've been trying to battle since god knows how long is the idea that your liver doesn't detox unless there are amino acids present, suggested by some that you can not detox unless you continue to eat protein. There people out there making this shit up as they go along that you need amino acids present in a certain quantity for the liver to function in detox mode.
ha.

FYI, there are always trace amounts of amino acids present in the liver, and what's more the body has all it needs to detox itself if you absolutely get out of your own way. you don't need supplements or a specific diet to detox - whoever believes that amino acids are required is ridiculous - even from a scientific perspective. if your body needs amino acids it can pull it from fat cells.

That goes for all Juice - of all varieties - veggies alone - fruit alone - fruit and veggies !
Juice has been a subject of many debates - in my opinion mostly by people who don't use it and - don't prescribe and don't experience it in action - I watched so many 1000s of people change their diets and have seen miracles in chemistry. 

I have as many complicated answers PRO juice as the leading naysayer can twist CONs. 
Therefore I'm very proudly defiant because I'm sick of watching people I know suffer in the cycle of greed created by big companies in the processed food and junk food that feed big pharm more sick people who In turn feed more surgery happy doctors - that rough I know. But I feel that way.
NOW ---curative medicine and trauma medicine and trauma surgery are brilliant and thank god we have science- medicine and science have done wonders for child birthing and birth defects and blindness and so many mind bendingly great things! but there's a perversion and corruption present when it comes to preventative medicine. With preventive medicine and life style facts and scientific nutritional data - we are sadly in the dark ages. 
Let's be clear - juice and food are not medicine or a panacea - we hate to hear that. Foods can't be prescribed - no two chemistries are ever in the same place at the same time.
Although juice is and fresh wholes foods are flooded with nutrients - ITS ALWAYS PRIMARILY ABOUT WHAT YOU DONT EAT RATHER THAN WHAT YOU DO EAT! (All caps wasn't really necessary there in this day and age. That was a little dated I admit.)

Your body is the miraculous healing machine- you just need to get out of its way -

When the body's own healing mechanism is closed - or not functioning - thank god for science medicine and surgery.

joan insulted my father from the stage for bringing a underage kid to a 10pm show. 
she looked at me and asked me if i knew what she was talking about. she cursed a bunch and then told me i was lucky to be out late listening to grownups being vulgar. 
joan rivers in my opinion is one of the 15 most important comedians of all time, several of which i was lucky enough to see before i was 15. my heart filled condolences to her family and friends.  i am very honored to have been part of her life via juice press.

researchers believe that probiotics induce an improvement in total cholesterol (reduction in “bad” cholesterol), reduce blood glucose and insulin resistance and help regulate the hormone system tied to blood pressure and fluid balance.

in turn, study participants experienced a moderate reduction in both systolic and dualistic blood pressure after a period of eight weeks on probiotics. moderate or not, this minor drop in blood pressure correlates to a 22% reduction in the risk of death from heart disease, heart attack and stroke. , life force protein smoothie. have you gotten your camu camu fix today?, Sign of the changing times.

microbial diversity and concern over the impact of disappearing beneficial bacteria is a hot button of late, with the medical community examining the connection between our gut diversity (or lack thereof) and proliferation of diseases like autoimmune disease, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, obesity and allergic asthma. as for what came first, the disorder, or the disruption of microbial bacteria, the verdict is still out, but researchers have tied the elimination of microbial diversity to western habits like frequent antibiotic use, animal protein heavy diets and cesarean deliveries, to name a few."

Every now and then some totally clueless reporter will write an article about how expensive commercially bought juices are- and that experts say a juice fast is asinine - or there's too much sugar or fat or whatever !

There are plenty of expert doctors who recommend juice fasting - that's first if all.
 Juice fasting was not invented by a handful of pot smoking hippy vegetarians sitting around in their back yards passing the bong around. 
Water Fasting has been around many thousands of years as a way of purification - and there are studies to prove that a reductionist type diet is the most profound way of restoring  health provided the body's natural pathway to recovery is open and able to heal itself - a common practice by doctors is to recommend that you quit smoking if youre a patient with a Lung disease. Why? Reductionist theory. Leave it out and you'll have an immediate reciprocal improvement in your health.
Patients with problems with mucas and phlegm are told to leave out dairy. And so on. 

raw fruit sugar is not to be mentioned in the same breath as processed sugar. Sugar is not sugar - meaning not all sugar is the same just as not all salts are same - processed sugar and salts are isolated from their nutrients and are treated in a way that make them poisonous to the body. 

Guys, remember this is not really complicated - it's what you leave out of your diet that allows you to achieve wellness or optimal health. 

A juice cleanse is a reduction diet where you're leaving out everything except basic nutrition - by doing this you allow the body to focus all of it's attention towards simple healing processes.

Hey doctors 
Instead of asking me where are my studies are to prove this ... You should be spending all of your time and resources helping me prove it to you directly. 

If all of the juice whackos like me are right - together we can save tens of millions - just buy simply telling people to drink more  juice - imagine!!

In a juice cleanse Theres enough fiber to support a juice only diet - you don't need that much protein -although there is protein in juice .....and the sugar occurring in the fruit is accompanied by a flood of vitamins - vitamins and minerals - duh!
Everyone benefits from raw fruit. 
If you're starting to slip up your diet over the summer try doing a week away from booze and eat only fruits and vegetables morning and night. Radish - cucumbers - all the peppers - carrots - strawberry - loads of tomatoes - citrus - all the leafy greens you can stomach -
If you get enough calories from a broad spectrum plant based diet - including nuts sprouts seeds vegetables and fruit... All of nutritional needs are met - all!

Juice fast at lease one or two days a weeks over the summer and stop being influenced by schmucks who are in way over their heads when they talk about juicing - and nutrition in general. Ill do battle with anyone over this subject - anyone. Bring me genomist, doctor, astronomical, whatever...

Also start a consistent routine of probiotic supplementation from a non dairy source - stay consistent - 

My company has helped tens of thousands of people do short terms and many many hundreds do long long terms juice fasts. I be never seen one person not do significantly better after a mid term cleanse. I've never seen a juicer have gyclemic problems.

I've seen many people - many- get off medications - I ve seen people change all of their cholesterol numbers for the better- just by fasting on juice.. Never seen one persons numbers go up.
Is this all anecdotal science? Probably. But it's experiential. And that counts for something.

This basket of fruit shown is my dinner - veggies and fruits are life for me.

Goodnight all
Stay away from that bag of gluten free pretzels - it's still junk.

Marcus, IM PERSONALLY BEGGING YOU TO STOP AND READ THIS
ABOUT FOOD AND YOUR DIET.

1. food dummies.
there are plenty of know it all fitness professionals and even mds that have all the answers about basic nutrition. then why are we all so confused? it's the food dummies' faults for setting us up to fail! bogus half truths and whacky unscientific notions of nutrition exist at every turn.

2. common myths.
the average healthy person should avoid fruit, avoid the naturally occurring and awesome healing power of raw fruit sugars. this is just asinine foolishness.

where do you suppose you’ll get your vitamins from if you abstain from fruit?

there are dynamic healing forces in raw fruit sugar (raw form = no artificial or concentrated processed sugars).

fruit sugar is required for health and digestive hygiene. 

diabetics or diseased people are told to avoid all sugar. and this is silly. fruits that contain fructose do not require insulin. fruit with starch will contain glucose which requires some insulin. fructose in whole fruit will not raise a diabetic’s blood sugar. They need to abstain from processed foods and eliminate dietary mistakes to improve their chemistries.

im spending a lot of time on fruit sugar because the very fabric of “muscle up” science diets are based on utter nonsense: more protein, no sugar, lower calories!
this type of diet may serve to reduce your weight (not always) – but mostly serves to acidify the blood, age us faster, weaken the immune system, reduce overall energy, and in the end make us sicker faster.

you got to trust me.
the cleanest fuel comes from raw vegetation. protein loading is a myth.
if you want to BULK up take in more calories altogether - and the best source of these calories is always from a plant based diet.

im not saying you need to go out and eat 43 bananas and run a marathon. this type of unbalanced diet is ridiculous as well.

unless someone ordered you to avoid fruit, you need plenty of fresh raw fruit every day. if you can’t get the bad perception of fruit alone out of your head then drink our raw fruit juice with greens mixed in. this way the glycemic index is averaged between the fruit and the vegetable.

stop protein hunting. too much protein is a problem in your diet not a solution.
east more fruit, eat more vegetables.
drink a lot of green juice.

for god's sake avoid processed foods and beverages.

dont underestimate the awesome power of these (juice press) juices.

- how long have you been working at juice press?
 
since october 2013 (so almost 4 months). 

- what inspired you to start working for juice press?

 jp15 had just opened a block from where i had just moved.  after trying the dr. green and learning about the cold-press process from the awesome staff, i was hooked.  as a performer, my health, my body, and what i put into my body are incredibly important to me. i wanted to learn about and invest in a lifestyle and products that were not just "healthy", but that elevated my physical and mental wellbeing to its full potential! it was "love at first sip" for me! i knew i wanted to be a part of jp, and i happened to ask if they were hiring, not knowing that jp15 was new to the neighborhood.  i'm so glad that i asked, and that freddie met me with such enthusiasm!

- did juice press change the way you eat/think/live? 

 yes. i get "juice press withdrawals" now, when i haven't had my daily jp.  i had done juice cleanses in the past and have always made nutrition a priority... but until i worked at jp, i didn't truly know what i was consuming... i just took other people's word for it.  i trusted labels, rather than really learning about different ingredients, supplements, and foods.  juice press changed how i think about food & drink nutrition.  i ask questions like, "where did this come from?"; "how was it made?", "what are the benefits of consuming this?".  now i know to get a "volcano" when i'm starting to feel sick; a green juice ("mother earth" being my go-to) when i need to alkalize and flush my body with greens; and, yes... a "sweet wheatgrass" to clear that hangover!  juice press has made me aware and appreciative of the kind of nutrients that i can and should be putting into my body.  and jp has provided me with a way to respect my body and overall being!

- what else do you do besides juice press? 

right now, i'm in the cast of mamma mia! on broadway.  i recently graduated from the university of michigan with a bfa in musical theatre, and have been a working actress involved in various projects, productions, with auditions for tv, film, & theatre since moving to nyc in may 2013.  i am passionate about community outreach through the arts, and have been part of multiple not-for-profits and organizations in the past, and am eager to get involved in nyc!  i love playing the piano, cycling, running, yoga, and eating macarons (i think that should be jp's next "indulgent sweet" recipe!), don't forget! run club tomorrow, 9am, from 82/columbus, 92/madison, 1 west 22nd st, 122 greenwich ave. #willrunforjuice, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are a thing of the past. almond butter and berry jam, however, complement each other quite splendidly.

i drank an unbelievable amount of juice today and feel great, but mystified how i drank 10 bottles of juice. i started my cleanse on monday  feb 17 2014 and i noticed that night a better sleep pattern than I've had in months. which is to say that i actually sleep for a change!!

i also noticed how eager i was to spring out of bed at 7am. which sounds late for most people in food management - however, i don't usually hit the sack before 130a or 2a. always answering emails !!!

today was harder for me than normally on cleanses. i was stressed out about 19 things and i wanted to eat to soothe my mind. every time i drank a juice i felt better. so i drank a lot of juice today because i was dealing with époque problems right up until midnight.

I'm only in 2 full days but i already had an abstract but strong feeling of clarity on the way home from work:

toxic memories pile up in the very essence of my fibers and are trapped within me. the obsession with time is toxic and foolish but unfortunately I'm a slave to it. the accumulation of possessions is and the confinement of architecture are also toxic for me. again, I'm a slave to things by choice.

i had a vision driving home when looking at these buildings I've been looking at for 30 years. the vision was that someone else looked at these buildings for 30 years, i will be looking at them for another 30 years, and one day some one in 30 years will be starting his or her journey to looking at the same buildings for their next 30 years and so on.
there was a blur in the understanding of time for 3 seconds and in that time i realized that time was such a nonsensical construct of our minds. it was cleansing for three whole seconds to not understand time at all. i was like a baby.

then i resumed my normal obsession. my clarity is already epic. i sensitive to how things that would effect me a really deep negative way, i compartmentalize to a degree and deny they exist. noise, pollution, and being surrounded by loudness and insensitivity and the lack of nature i live with. i can do it every day because I'm numb. it feels harder and more intense with out foods and stimulation.

on a juice fast, drink away. drink as much as you can and include water. start as soon as possible. work up the courage to just start a juice fast. cheat if need be. start day one with smoothies and add chia seeds to all juice to fill up. each day leave something else out until you are at only raw fresh juice . do 60% veggie and 40% starchy vegetables and fruit. somewhere in that %. thats not a rule to follow only a guideline.i can prove that there are very few mistakes that one can make drinking raw - non hpp'd juice. ORGANIC! must be organic. repeat there are very few if any mistakes in drinking lots of fresh organic raw juice. I've experienced thousands of people's cleanses with them and watch the results from start to finish. 

start a fast and don't quit before the transformation happens. it takes longer than 3 days.. but if all you can do to start is 3 days.. do it. theres still enormous value in 3 days.

RON is an amazing amazing artist and I have a great deal of admiration for his work and accomplishments!

Ron Agam , a painter influenced by the works of Joseph Albers and the Russian Constructivists painter of the last century. He presently integrates his work with technology and his developing his artistic creativity towards what can be called “Neo-Kineticism”
His is mostly recognised for his hallucinogenic, kaleidoscopic worlds which he creates on flat panel digital lenticulars. With mind-curving vortexes of colours, his pieces are as complex as a rare agate stone. If looked at long enough, the trippy visual creations begin to play tricks on the mind. The innovative lenticulars are an extension of his paintings, which he turned to after an illustrious 52-year photography career. The unique 3D creations are the result of his experiments with different mediums

hpp is clinically proven in europe to adversely effect juice. 

University of Leuven (the best Belgian university – article attached) summary of negative points about HPP:
1)      There is some vitamin C losses during HPP processing.  “a higher vitamin C loss in fruit juice compared to in buffer solutions because of the existence of endogenous pro-oxidants in fruit juice such as metal ions and enzymes.”
2)      A study on stability of vitamin K in buffer solutions has shown that pressure (650 MPa/70 [1]C/3 h) induced chemical reaction resulting in small quantities of meta and para isomeric DielseAlder products of vitamin K1 degradation.
3)      Pressure treatment lowered the content of vitamin A
4)      The TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant capacity) index of orange juice decreased after HP treatment in the pressure range of 100 and 800 MPa combined with temperatures from 30 up to 65 [1]C) as a function of treatment time (up to 90 min). At all temperatures studied, the antioxidant capacity of orange juice decreased faster when the pressure level of the HP/T treatment was increased (Indrawati, Van Loey, & Hendrickx, 2004). The decrease of antioxidant capacity in orange juice during HP processing is mainly caused by ascorbic acid degradation.
5)      Combined treatments of pressure between 300e400 MPa and high citric acid concentration (1.2e2%, w/w) decreased the antioxidant activity of tomato puree.

marcus antebi, no need to venture out in the cold. order your juice press craving. we'll deliver throughout manhattan and williamsburg., 3 very very amazing juice press originals are blended drinks: south of the border, tomato gazpacho, and green giant. we have several bottled fresh blended juice and blended only mixes. the 3 mentioned are unusual in that they are true blended elixirs. with cayenne, garlic and olive oil, they are great during winter cleanses and for those needing a push start in the winter. blended vs juice only. there isn't a better choice. juice only minus the cellulose fiber is faster and more cleansing because you are leaving out the fiber. blended is more mild cleansing because you're leaving the fiber in. this is something controversial to people with common nutritional science background and little experience with the more conclusive science of nutrition and lacking in experience themselves. there are as many controversies and arguments about the subject. please follow the simple path of fred bisci, norman walker, jack lalaine, and many others. there real medical doctors who study and use juice on patients... its simple chemistry and it can be proven on your chemisty today. marcus........, what better way to celebrate presidents day than with a juice cleanse? start today and join marcus on his 30 day cleanse!, -today is day one of my 30 day juice fast. feb. 17th

2)      Compression of foods may shift the pH of the food as a function of imposed pressure.

3)      There appears to be a wide range of pressure sensitivity among the pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. Patterson and others (1995) have studied a clinical isolate of E. coli O157:H7 that possesses pressure resistance comparable to spores. Some strains of Salmonella spp. have demonstrated relatively high levels of pressure resistances. Given these pressure resistances and their importance in food safety, E. coliO157:H7 and Salmonella spp. are of key concern in the development of effective HPP food treatments.

The body naturally will follow and ancient rhythm and want to store more fat and hold more weight to shield from the cold.

The dietary mistakes we make in late december through the new year now take their toll on us in the dead of winter. We are lacking in sunlight, the primary source of Vitamin D, and we are lacking in fresh air. Winter depression effects the production of white blood cells and lowers our immune system. Living in a continental climate is tough going.

Juice and Blended smoothies are a vital part of maintaining system to stay in the game of optimal health.

 Juice is the faster acting cleanser than smoothies because it enters the blood stream faster. Adding back the cellulose from the fiber in a blended smoothie is slows its cleansing power. Some would argue differently.

Drink plenty of green juices and do smoothies every day. If the cold of a frozen smoothie doesn't sit well -  make your smoothie with room temperature fruit and liquids or allow your juice or smoothie to climb to room temperature. Your Call.

If you're eating flesh foods as part of your diet avoid foods fried in a pan or on a grill. Avoid all saturated fats fried in saturated fats.

Ginger and turmeric are warming. Especially in warm water with lemon and raw honey.

If you are carrying more than 8 lbs of excess weight you are likely to feel more lethargy. try your best! 

Inflammatory foods will take their toll on your training in the winter. Do your best to plan a juice fast in the winter using juice and smoothies as the only source of sustenance.

Do your best to maintain simple warming exercises even if at your weakest level. Keep moving and sharp. Training is training and its all good.

BACK ROUND:

i've known arjan steve milles for 12 years. he brought me into muay thai for fitness and trained me to eventually fight on a competitive level. 

arjan steve is a disciplined guy who has an awesome diet and is in unbelievable shape. this POST fight cleanse was not intended for him to drop weight. i'll let him blog what he hopes to gain and learn from the experience. 

arjan steve is without a doubt one of the best trainers there are in the world. his also a mean motor scooter in the ring.

he trains everyone from fighters, soccer moms, kids, and so on.. i am a connoisseur of muay thai because i ve trained with many trainers from thailand to south africa to jersey, miami, los angeles, and even the bahamas baby. 

we are doing 30 day cleanses with a wide variety of people and I'm excited to include this active fitness pro into the mix. read his blog!!

"No problems to report, not hungry, still training my students and feeling very strong in my own training. "

arjan steve milles has competitive and coaching experience in muay thai spanning more than two decades. after turning professional, steve captured the world kickboxing association and international sport kickboxing association u.s. champion belts, as well as the intercontinental champion title for the u.s. muay thai association, battling current and former world champions in north america, europe and asia. he retired with a professional record of 20 wins, 8 losses and 2 draws.

In other words, all the fad diets are largely the same. none of them offer a truly new approach. it's being in a calorie deficit that enables weight loss, not the actual quirks and rules of the particular diet 

These diets are one-dimensional because they focus only on weight loss. they don't tell you what you should be eating to reduce inflammation or your vital numbers (cholesterol, LDL, HDL, tryglicerides, and non-HDL). 

There is no guarantee that simply losing weight will lower your numbers or that you will even feel better overall. weight loss alone does not ensure that aches and pains caused by inflammation will dissipate.

What i recommend for every human being is a diet that considers all the components that relate to optimal health. are you ready? 

By simply eliminating all processed foods from your diet and including fresh whole fruits and vegetables and fresh raw juices, you will more than likely meet all your health goals.

Such a lifestyle change is a starting point that will have miraculous short-term effects on your chemistry. you will feel better within a few days. on a primarily plant-based diet that excludes processed foods, you will likely still lose weight even if your caloric intake is higher than those restrictive diets. 

You have to stick to this plan. absolutely no processed foods. this is the holy grail of nutritional science. if you leave out processed foods, there will be an immediate overall improvement in your chemistry.

This is the concept that we have to hold to and expand on, not rapid and toxic weight-loss programs. it's hard work, but we have to begin the discussion and support each other's efforts., null, spring training begins with Mark Teixeira and marcus antebi at Soho Strength Lab's juice press grand opening.

Find Out Tuesday jan 28th - 3:30pm-5:30pm - at Juice Press #11 at 1 west 22nd Street, ny ny between 5th ave. and 6th ave. ask starting defensive ends Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril for your self., MATT PLOTKIN TRUSTED FRIEND OF JUICE PRESS! REACHING COMPLETION FOR OF HIS FIRST CLEANSE. 30 DAYS!!

"I have been an athlete my whole life. One can even argue that at the age of 37, I am more active than I was at 22. However, no matter how hard or often I worked out , I have never been able to get rid of the excess 15-20lbs that I have carried for more than a decade. Deep down I knew if I truly wanted to lose weight and get healthier, I would have to change my eating habits. However, my love affair with food always trumped any diet I ever attempted.  
 
I have been a Juice Press customer for over a year, but it wasn’t until recent conversations with Marcus that I learned what the true benefits of Juice Press products were, or more importantly, the damage that the other foods I consume were causing. He convinced me that if I truly wanted to do this right, then I should do a 30day cleanse of just juices and smoothies, which meant no booze, coffee or solid food! So on Jan 2nd, at 209.5 lbs, and a cholesterol level of 236 I started my journey….
 
The first couple of days were intense, as I suffered from massive headaches given the caffeine withdrawal. I forced my way through it, and what helped was that I was drinking the drinks that I liked. I stayed away from the real green tasting juices, and drank more smoothies. My daily lineup would consist of Vital Force, Dr. Green, MILF, Fountain of Youth and Tomato Gazpacho. I would stay loyal to these flavors at first, but then added Pink Punk, Body Fit, & Rocket Fuel to the mix.. It wasn’t until day 3 or 4 when I woke up with a complete different feeling throughout my entire body and soul. I went to sleep starving and miserable, but woke up refreshed with a sense of energy that I hadn’t felt for I don’t think ever. My usual back pain in the morning is gone, and once I started to see the first few pounds come off, that just motivated me even more. My whole attitude had changed also. Not only do I feel different, but I am thinking differently as well. I am not saying drinking juice made me smarter, but I am definitely thinking clearer. I knew going into this that the biggest challenge and obstacle to my cleanse was a big family event we had scheduled over the weekend of January 17th. It was a Saturday night affair with cocktail hour, open bar, late night pizza truck, basically everything that I usually look forward to as it’s an excuse to eat and drink in complete excess! I am happy to report that I made it through the night without a morsel of food, or a drop of liquor. If you had told me a month ago I wouldn’t be drinking in that type of setting, I would have said I would have been moping in the corner all night, but in actuality I didn’t leave the dance floor! I am about 75% done on my cleanse and I currently weigh 194, over 15lbs less from when I started. I am getting blood work done next week to see where my cholesterol levels are, but have to imagine they are down. I haven’t felt this good physically since high school.
 
It has been a remarkable journey, and I look forward to having a clean slate and being able to pick and choose the foods I introduce back into my diet. Of course I am going to drink again, and have a slice of pizza, as those things are a part of who I am. But I am going to practice moderation, and I am going to be a lot more selective to what I put into my body going forward.  Thank you Juice Press for having me accomplish in 3weeks, what I haven’t been able to do in 15years!  " MATT PLOTKIN, "Hi Marcus, 

I wanted to thank you and Michael again for the opportunity to participate in this juice cleanse. It's been an amazing experience that helped me learn a great deal about Juice Press's products, it's business and the industry. It was also an eye-opening experience for me that will impact my eating habits for the long term and change the way my whole family eats for years to come. I really appreciate the opportunity for this experience. "

BRIAN HOLMES - FRIEND OF JUICE PRESS IS 5 DAYS OUT FROM COMPLETING HIS FIRST JUICE FAST. FIRST TIME OUT 30 DAYS!!!!

---------------------------------------------

"My name is Brian, I'm 40 years old and this is my first juice cleanse. I maintain a relatively active lifestyle for a father of three and have trained hard for all sorts of races from marathons and triathlons to 10k's and 5k's, but I tend to become unmotivated when I don't have a race date on the calendar. I've never been on a diet and healthy eating was never a big focus of mine. I'm 6" 1' and my weight usually fluctuates throughout the year between 180 lbs and 190 lbs. At the start of this juice cleanse I weighed 186.6 lbs, but I think my ideal weight should be somewhere in the high 160's to low 170's. 

This Juice Press cleanse has been an amazing experience. I never imagined I would feel this good and learn this much about myself in 30 days. I have 4 days until the end of my cleanse and I weigh 170.1 lbs, so I've lost about 17 lbs in less than 4 weeks. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation of food for 30 days, but I was wrong. Seeing and smelling food was tough for the first couple of days, but since then, hunger hasn't been an issue. The smoothies are my favorite, but I usually only have one each day. Lucky Seven, Perfect Pear, Vital Force, Dr. Green and Gravity are my favorite juices. When my juice cleanse is over in a few days, I plan to continue drinking juice daily, while being much smarter about what I eat. I think my brain now finally realizes that my body doesn't need all of the garbage I've been feeding it. ", ginger fireball: out perfect immune booster.

http://www.juicepress.com/hot-soups/adzuki-bean-chili, here we go again. so i found this article DETAILS magazine - (FEB2014 - page 71) about the juice wars.

it’s humorous and trying to be controversial. although it’s rehashing 75 year old arguments. nothing new is being said. 

there are always controversies in medicine and science. we do 100 hundred studies on something. they come out with the results and either fads or fears emerge until the next set of studies emerge with new sets of facts and truths.

when ever there is a change in the standard thinking of the time people get nervous mostly because they don’t want to NOT KNOW something.

50 years ago doctors thought smoking was ok and everyone smoked camels. they were all dead wrong about that call!
 i make that comparison because i believe that the pro-smokers of yesteryear are the equivalents to todays naysayers about raw juice, super foods and blended smoothies, the raw food diet, veganism, and of course juice cleansing and fasting. 

i don’t expect anyone to do real investigative journalism YET on juice. especially in sexy magazines. we are however at a wonderful point in our JUICE HISTORY.

grab that DETAILS MAGAZINE and shimmy through it. 

i want to comment that I’m happy to see juice is a hot topic and we are all more or less (mostly less) on the same side and page.

-lauren slayton made great comments. kudos.
 -joe cross is always awesome and he’s one of my heroes of the juice movement. check out his movie fat sick and nearly dead. it is epic.

-kimberly snyder. sorry. she clearly doesn’t understand juicing. she’s my new nemesis. she doesn’t have my experience with cleansing and clearly lacks experience with cleansing the masses. her comments indicate allegedly that she doesn’t understand autolysis…

so I’m on the war path to defend science and smite kimberly’s missteps. i would gladly challenge her to a public duel on nutrition and juicing knowledge anytime - anywhere.
on her comments specifically about fiber:
if you add the fiber back in you won’t have the same autolysis process.
for everything you leave out - there is a reciprocal improvement in your overall chemistry. pressed juice is not meant to be utilized as a whole food.

she’s misusing the term whole food. a common mistake among the un-initiated.

all juice starting as a whole food - and remains unprocessed and it’s not made into battery acid - it’s nutrients are intact and of high value - vitamins and minerals are intact and not lost in juicing. 

its not whole in as much as we are removing the fiber material FOR THE SAKE of a direct benefit. 
the whole purpose of juice is to get the vitamins and minerals quickly and leave out fat and protein to promote autolysis. 

the protein and fat is not there in noticeable amounts but on a cleanse, through autolysis one will recycle their own morbid or weak cells.

of course today a lot of doctors are going to still be against juice. most are PRO juice. and many brilliant doctors have proven its efficacy over the last several decades in studies.

for all of us, including me, the one thing that we should not take is an absolute approach. I may be branded as a fanatic. but as much of a fanatic as magellan was by declaring the earth was flat.

on fruit sugar: no one should say that fruit sugar is good for all chemistries. there are many sides to the story of individual chemistries.
i am not implying that people should go out and drink a gallon of orange juice. I’m also not implying that fiber is something to be avoided in general. you need fiber. and the more digestive resistant your foods  are, the more fiber you need, i.e, flesh foods.

many doctors take an opposite position because of the way they are programmed. there is plenty of sciences that prove the awesome dynamic power of juice. 

the DETAILS article poorly quotes more bad science in comparing raw fresh fruit juice sugars in grams to the the highly toxic processed sugar in a snickers bar. 

this is so common and such a ridiculous mistake it serves only to prove the individuals making the comments utter lack of experience with treating people with juices, and their own lack of personal experience with juice in their own diet. traditional nutrition has brainwashed its students to promote diets based on high protein, calories + or -, and a litany of other relevant by secondary observations.

if a comparison should be made - compare a snickers bar to an apple. itis closer because they are both concentrated foods. compare coca cola to fruit juice - thats more realistic. never a snickers to juice. but the comparison in both cases have many flaws.

regardless of the sugar, the soda is toxic poison and pure acid that you can take the paint off a car with.
take a glass of fresh juice as it relates to your chemistry and it leaves behind an amazing alkaline ash in the blood stream. this reduces inflammation in the body.

this is the awesome power of juice. in most peoples chemistry the sugars in raw fresh juice are immaterial.

sugar (the raw unprocessed naturally occurring sugars) effect every one differently. . i if a person’s blood sugar bounces up and down they’re going to feel much much worse over all if they consume highly processed foods with processed sugars than if that the same person is drinking fresh raw fruit juices with higher grams of sugar. (moderation is still key for that person.)

if that same person mixes more green juices in with the fruit - say 1:1, they’ll feel fabulous. or fruit juices diluted 1:1 in water allow even the most toxic people to make amazing progress in their overall chemistry. unless they’re so toxic the symptoms they feel are actual detoxing and not illness.

soda can dissolve a sea shell if left to soak for several days. theoretically you would have to drink about 80 glasses of water to alkalize yourself after drinking this garbage. the person eating processed garbage - never makes progress unless he’s taking lots of medicine and even then its short lived. 

with soda and its sugar - because its so acidic it promotes inflammation - inflammation is a big big problem. 

whereas with fruit juice and its sugar, its so alkalizing because of the vitamins and minerals - its awesome. even citric acid as it relates to the digestive alkalies converts to neutral salts. this is simple science

don’t get bored, stay with me. lets recap because i tend to ramble as i am not a writer or media training. I am house trained.

if you are producing insulin and are efficient at stabilizing sugar you won’t have a problem with a  reasonable amount of fresh fruit juices every day.

in terms of fiber: the juices have trace amount of fiber (the inulins and the sacharides are there in trace amounts to not cause problems in juice only fasts)

fiber as it relates specifically to juice fasting and “cleansing” IS cleansing because your leaving it out. 

remember, its what you leave out that allows you cleanse. if you have fiber back in , you can only cleanse to the point that you include something back in.

too many “knowledgeable people are focusing on calories, sugar and fiber. the comparison to this approach to health and nutrition is similar to a sailor in 20 foot seas spending all his time concentrating on decorating the interior of his ship rather than keeping the vessel weather proof and sea worthy. 

good MODERN nutrition is all about reducing inflammation - and getting quality nutrient rich calories. not just calories - 

**raw fruit sugar matters in context to the efficiency of one’s chemistry.

**fiber is relevant to the overall diet - not just to raw fresh juices. 

**and calories are secondary to cleansing and unclogging the system.

it's great that the argument is heating up and juices are cooling down! 

the great news is no one disagrees that juices in some context are healthy and we are all more aware of the benefits of  predominately plant based diets.

"Thank you Marcus,

Your words strike a chord with me.  I too have been recently shifting into a more meaningful space, wishing to give more, yet not really knowing in what form the giving will take.  However, being a part of John's experience has made this nebulous feeling a bit clearer.

John and his family tried valiantly to save, or at least prolong, his life, but they were working against a very powerful, archaic, impersonal, bureaucratic system rooted in the pursuit of profit and a science guided more by politics than honest scientific inquiry...  At a ludicrously high cost.

My growing frustration with our society's "heathcare" system (in T. Colin Campbell's new book, Whole, he calls it a diseasecare system...  Which is a bit more fitting.), horror over Fukushima's impact on the life of our oceans, the massive corruption of the FDA, Monsanto, pharmaceutical companies, industrial farming, crazy gag laws protecting corporate interests, Washington's complicity in so many corporations' illicit actions where profit it always a higher priority than public health, the general public's lack of nutritional knowledge- or deliberately misguided education of the public in order to sell a myriad of products...  The list goes on and on I'm afraid...  I could go off about these and more subjects, but I'm sure your knowledge surpasses mine and I wouldn't be able to tell you anything you don't already know.(!)

This exasperation, mixed with my fascination (maybe even mild obsession) with health, nutrition, wellness, fitness, environmentalism and smothered in the wish to help those suffering from curable diseases, is a recipe for change.  I'm not sure what role this will take in my life, but I am staying open to opportunity.

If the memory of John's life can act as a catalyst for just one person to reach out and help someone else, it is a life to be celebrated.  If my appeal to you helped you get closer to your late night aspirations, then I am grateful John helped you on that path.  This thought helps to alleviate the pain of losing such a radiant human being so early in his life.   I appreciate you sharing that with me.
Thank you.

Actually, I would love to say my thanks in person... if you ever get an opportunity to eat lunch in a seated position ; ) I'd be honored if you joined me for lunch sometime soon."

Sincerely,

1 west 22nd street
71st/columbus
92nd/madison, Fossil fuels are like processed food in every way. They seem cheaper in the upfront scheme of things but they're both ultimately costly beyond measure. I'm not talking about global warming - don't worry I'm not losing my edge.  I'm just making a real easy to absorb example here. Fossil fuels are filthy from the start and leave behind a sickening and filthy waste byproduct. The problem is that the use of them is ingrained in our collective behavior for about 100 plus years or more. Noone wants to pay more for anything upfront. We don't want to wait or Be bothered toiling with a natural processes..and why should we when we can move with rapid and thoughtless momentum on to next thing. 
The world has become sedated and drugged by the power and awesomeness of our own inventions and technology. The combustion engine being one of them. I love them too. More than anyone. We all should. But similar to a bad drug addict I am finding it nearly impossible to reach a bottom and change my world through and through without having to have something catastrophic happen. There are brilliant simple alternative sources of energy available to the world. Simple. One day fossil fuel will be mind bendingly ridiculous to the future generation no longer using it. When I travel and I see fast food in every corner and how difficult it is in some places to be good produce and or buy ready to eat fabulous salads and fresh juices ...It opens my mind in a good way.
I realize that if I'm lucky I can be a pioneer of alternative fuel...juice and raw foods..The very best of both. I'm going to be a big company one day and I swear to my own life I won't manipulate people and cause them harm knowingly for profits. My partners and I have and chance to leave a legacy behind hopefully more epic one day than wholefoods. My pledge is no more fake processed toxic fuel for humans. I'm a true believer . I don't want it for myself send my family. . I don't want to get rich selling twinkles or processed beef...I'm actually not sure why I'm becoming a do gooder...I'm actually sort of a prick...but I think that's what makes me good at juice and food. I have to be tough and nd out spoken to keep this moving. Juice press is more than my life now. I hope it's many thousands of people's lives as well. We are a community of people who want the best fuel every day. In the early history which is happening now..it seems like a product inaccessible unless you have money.. but the die is cast. I can see more and more specifically focused raw food and juice concepts catching on. The greedy part of me hopes they all fail.... but the higher thinking part knows that if we all succeed. .maybe processed foods go away. Probably not as easy or as fast as I'd like...I'm a slightly bored 45 year with no bad habits after years of therapy and whatnot. I'm an ex danger sportsman ...I'm itching to keep my mind busy busy busy. I need more action.. partners of juice press lets get this party started... Austin and Vegas need "clean fuel support." Mk maybe that can be our new catch phrase..."clean fuel supoort" by the domain. .call the attorneys. ..I'm going to now to wash my face and brush my teeth in the ocean...Happy new year., The ocean is a macrocosm of our digestive systems. 
The ocean is a dynamic "host" fluid of digestive mediums that within it live a multitude of friendly organisms that share in the delicate balance of a perfect chemistry.  There seems to be a divine wisdom in this... like our own biologies. Both would exhaust  super slowly if nothing corrupted them. If nothing were to upset the balance of feeding - absorption - utilization - evolving - wasting it would take more than 100 years for each human to die.... But there is an interruption in this perfect flow. "Civilized foods". Yes thats right.. elegant and glorious gadgety foods. Sauces and tricky techniques, preserves, and chemicals, excess use,  salts and sugars...polution... all these have corrupted both the world we leavin and our bodies. Everyone knows this so I'm not a putts for mentioning it. I'm not writing freaking poetry here either.
I'm drawing on two parallels here.

very informative segment- http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/healthy-not-much-juices-drink-flat-belly-121540876--abc-news-health.html, Children and Food
This is a very very complex subject because it brings the issues of food, health, the immune system, chiding rearing beliefs, social and family  pressures, and doing what's convenient to the surface. 

I don't want to make my daughter feel like a prisoner in her own world. On the other hand what I consider to be toxic the majority of really good parents that i know and respect are willing to feed and indulge their children with. 

I believe teaching children to think about food and where it comes from elevates their consciousness and this is my moral obligation to my children. 

Teaching children from the earliest age that food is for their survival 
And educating at appropriate stages basic understanding of nutrition and how it is interconnected to their overall happiness and health is also a moral obligation. 

My parents failed abysmally with me and my sister and I spent most of my adult life correcting this shortfall. 

My sister sufferred with her weight our whole lives. 

In short
I don't think it's extreme to be different than other families and not classify junk food of any kind as a *treat*. I'd say cotton candy, red bull, fried foods, dorritos, mickydees, candy and so on are just utterly absurd items. The havoc these items wreak on a child's developing brain are epic.

Any good pediatrician or genomist can atest that processed foods on this level are the curse of human health. Especially our kids.

Treats should be fresh raw smoothies and whole fruits, coconuts and amazing raw foods... treats don't have to be orgasmic to have a treat like effect. Maybe here and there birthday cake. . Vegan of course..

children's protein intakes are way too high in our society and this is way too stimulating and too addictive.
Not to mention the other problems it causes with health. Cow's milk is a catastrophe. And theres so much more to talk about..

This is hard work because we're on the go. Who has time to convince a kid to eat salads and drink green smoothies? I dont.

I'm sure there are plenty of powerful moms out there that can elaborate on their experience and help me write a book. Working title: "mommy won't buy me cotton candy...but grandma will" childhood food conflicts and controversies ...who wants to help me write this book and illustrate it? I have two great doctors behind me on this subject.

starting weight: 168 pounds. weight at day 15: 157 pounds. kampkleanse.tumblr.com, flesh foods are concentrated protein. it is for that reason they accelerate the aging process. in fact stimulating foods, concentrated foods, and processed foods all make the body work harder to digest, assimilate, and waste.

eating short - fast meals 6 times a day also demands a lot of the body. this habit "speeds up" metabolism. something that is mistakingly thought of as good thing. but making your organs work all the time has neither short term or long benefits, (maybe) you will feel leaner for a short time, but generally your wearing yourself out faster.

humans are not meant to be grazing animals. we are designed to eat infrequently, meaning we are designed to fill an empty stomach not pile new food on top of old. no doubt we survive longer on "fast-transit" time foods: (vegetation). 

flesh foods are very "slow-transit" time foods. animals with short digestive tracts, such as big cats, do better on flesh based diets than humans. also big predators require enormous amounts of sleep because their vital forces are used in digestive processes.

in human beings, wasting vital force will have a negative impact on your overall immune system since storing vital force means their will be more energy for healing and recovery processes. 

flesh foods contain protein among other nutrients. the proteid matter is stimulating and addictive. nitrogenous gases from flesh foods are addictive. we take a life time to build up these gases in our system and its hard to feel good without feeding them with more gases. but the saturated fats and the unneeded amounts of protein cause problems and strain on the cleansing organs.

eat flesh foods a maximum of 3 days a week every other day at most. never eat starches with proteins. always combine a green leafy salad with protein foods. this is the correct food combination.

foods require different digestive times and different digestive mediums. combining the right foods together avoids fermentation, indigestive, and food from rotting in the digestive tract.

this does not mean you can't eat meat and other flesh foods and still be remarkably healthy, but for many technical reasons to slow the aging process down, you have to reduce the amount of protein you consume on a daily basis. 

dont fry meats in saturated fats even in a pan. broil, bake, grill, steam, and boil. boring. blah. but healthier. 

of course, eat wild fish, organic beef, and farm raised chicken. 

heavy sauces are a problem. 
raw flesh is dead and not the same as raw vegetation in terms of health. raw flesh is loaded with parasites. i fully disagree with eating raw meat although there are people here and there that swear by it. there is not logical scientific argument that can survive a rational argument for raw beef.
eggs: save for another discussion.

m. antebi, BEYOND CALORIES

because nutrition is more than just calories, it's important to look at the whole picture when assessing the value of a food or beverage. we feel it’s a catastrophic blunder to blindly pursue calorie counting. if your diet consists primarily of processed foods and you have a weight problem, your primary dietary goal should be the restriction of calories. but no matter where you take this obsession, you cannot achieve optimal health unless there is a shift in focus. 

the primary goal should be the restriction of processed foods. you cannot cause obesity and illness in a healthy and clean body that is consuming a diet consisting of vegetation in the form of fruits, vegetable, nuts, sprouts, and seeds. the clean body uses calories efficiently. the clean body stops eating when full. very few food addicts binge on vegetables. they generally reach for stimulating foods such as refined starchy carbs, over-cooked dead food, fried saturated fat, concentrated protein, as well as outright poisons such as processed salt, sugar, and white flour. calories from these substances will clog the digestive system. just like a high performing vehicle, the more low grade fuel you feed the body, the less fuel efficient it becomes. 

the calories question is complex. the highest degree of knowledge dictates that if you consume calories from raw foods in an unprocessed form, eliminate processed foods, and clean the digestive system, you should slowly lose weight, or at worst maintain a healthy weight without the risk of obesity--no matter how much you consume. this challenges everything you’ve heard about calories in-energy out. we are not saying you can eat 4,000 calories of raw oatmeal and not gain weight. there is a limit to how far you can challenge physics. we are saying that raw food calories matter less than processed food calories and certainly affect the body differently. if you want to accomplish weight loss or weight maintenance (which is the only reason we’ve become a calorie-conscious culture), and if you want to add optimal health to your life, you need to focus on the following things in equal measure: (1) eliminate processed foods; (2) reduce animal protein intake down to a max of three days a week or eliminate it completely; (3) avoid dairy at all costs; (4) do not eat too late or too many times throughout the day; (5) combine foods properly, e.g. no starches and proteins together; (6) drink more raw green juices; and (7) create a reasonable diet plan that you can live with and stick with it. 

we believe that raw juices are the best fuel for our body. consuming them will make us more biologically-efficient machines and we’ll need fewer calories to get better nutrition. introducing raw juices to our diet as an everyday habit is a fabulous antidote to the toxins we encounter. green juices neutralize acids and all raw juices make it easier to maintain blood alkalization. the main benefit of drinking raw juice is that if it helps us skip one or more crappy meals a day, we’re 1,000 times better off! obviously, we recommend drinking as much juice as possible each and every day. drinking juice and maintaining a sensible diet that excludes processed food is a step in the right direction towards optimal health.  

while many of juice’s nutritional benefits are readily displayed on the nutrition facts panel, all juices provide value beyond what is visible on the label. 100% juice is an ample source of phytonutrients (compounds in fruits, vegetables, and other plants that can help prevent and fight disease). although this benefit is not listed on the label, there is strong scientific support for the role fruits and vegetables play in reducing disease risk.

additionally, research shows that drinking 100% juice is associated with a more nutritious diet overall. studies suggest that appropriate consumption of 100% juice is linked to an overall healthier eating pattern, including reduced intake of total dietary fat, saturated fat, and added sugars.

M. ANTEBI, day twelve of the kamp kleanse has come and gone. today heidi muses on the topic of nutritional development of kids and the potential benefits of ridding the body of years of intestinal build up.

"the wrong tea can cause nausea and impede the progress of detoxification. without knowing the exact source of the product, i could easily be putting processed tea into my body, causing my body to work harder in its processing of the liquid. the goal during a cleanse is to put quick-transit-time, easy-to-process liquids into the system in order to promote the body’s detoxification. the human body is a miraculous healing agent on its own, provided you get out of the way and allow it heal. by eliminating processed foods as well as solid foods, you allow the body to focus on healing neglected maintenance. if you continue, however, to put caffeinated, processed, or abrasive liquids into a juice fast, then you are not allowing the body to fall into the natural path of detoxification. this is also why you should not drink coffee or alcohol on a juice fast, even though they are technically liquids." 

for more first-hand juice cleansing experiences that are t.m.i. for facebook, click here: http://kampkleanse.tumblr.com/, click the link to reveal the truth about pesticides: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=680420938656634, addictions to food and chemicals start at a very early point in our lives. there are many things that contribute to what connects us to food. 

the first is our innate weakness to crave stimulating chemicals like processed sugars and salts. caffeine, spices, rich foods, acid forming food, carbonated, alcoholic beverage, concentrated proteins, and so on are habit forming because they make us feel good in the short term. really good. what defense does a young child have against ice cream? if they're lucky they're allergic to it.

the second is that we are raised to have deep emotional connections to foods based on how the people we loved early in our lives linked us to food. i give my daughter a harmless stick of gum with a hug and praise because she listened to me and behaved on a particular day. how can she not crave gum for the rest of her life when she craves her father's love and attention? this is a minor example but it extends further to many other categories of food.

on holidays, my family gathered and celebrated. grownups focused their attention on the children, gossip and of course food. rich - delicious foods. we over ate. we ate. and ate. and we salted and sugared, and learned to gorge ourselves. food regardless of its negative effects on my chemistry was associated with warm positive loving feelings. 

for my father, food was the only relationship he had with a neglectful mother. she gave him very little in their family of 13 children in the way of self esteem and life lessons. but she fed him and over fed him. also he learned to insulate and protect himself psychically by being overweight - his weight was an emotional barrier.
food can numb our feelings.

thirdly we are bombarded by product campaigns that lead us all over the spectrum towards foods that are sickening and malnourishing to billions of people.

( i consider cigarettes part of this evil campaign since smoking is a from of consumption. smoking effects the chemistry like food. it is ingested and absorbed through the lungs. i consider the lungs a digestive organ.) smoking is an extreme. but what about energy drinks, processed foods, GMOs, etc.?

junk food is every where and its easy to get. it's often disguised as health food, or healthier food. the path to understanding nutrition is confusing because nutrition is the convergence of several complex sciences on a single point: human chemistry.

breaking the habits are hard….nearly impossible. I've battled with food addiction my entire life. i don't feel judgmental of those who struggle with food. i feel like i understand it. i feel compassion on an awesome level because everyone is me…everyone is more dear old father suffering through the ignorance of childhood in the 1950's. everyone is my older sister. i want to help people feel better about themselves. i want to want to give away what i have found and interpreted over the years. I'm getting really good understanding this stuff and i have a way of seeing recovery from addiction in a way that has been helpful to a lot of people. 

i want to learn how to help more and more people. otherwise, what the hell is the meaning of my life. without juice press and the exciting stress it causes me…. there is little motivation to do much of anything. i like what juice press has become and where it's taking the team and i.

lets explore food addiction and the trouble it causes so many of us. what are you troubled with ? what questions do you have about diet and food addiction. 

the coming holidays are a good time to observe how we eat. how we feel about how are families eat. how do you feel about how they relate to food. do you feel good about holiday eating or disrupted?

just think how many turkeys are thankful for you today., happy thanksgivingukkah! juice press gift cards available at all locations!, i want to try to maintain a humorous and polite edge on my reply to kate seamon's article calling people schmucks for juice cleansing on newswer.com.

to begin with, anyone who disagrees that the body is a miraculous healing machine with incredible healing capabilities on its own, please spend some time reading the "merck medical manual." 

the body performs countless natural detox processes every day through out your life. if these processes fail or weaken we become ill in various ways and even die. blood is cleansed through the lymphatic system and liver. this is a process that occurs in a healthy body. this is one example of your remarkable natural healing capabilities. 

science dictates that things like stress, pollution, genetics, diet and life style and even moods control how fast or slow you are able to cleanse. homeostasis through out the body is regulated by several processes one of which is the elimination of toxins. anyone with a brain and 3rd grade education can understand that there are in fact toxic foods. 

in addition, over eating is toxic because of several factors, one of which is fermentation and the intercellular gases it will create. another is that overeating may cause food to poorly digest and rot in the digestive system causing toxic bacteria to proliferate, and of course more fermentation and off gases. a dirty upper gi is scientifically at the root of many degenerative and acute illnesses. 

are you all following me here so far? other dietary mistakes such as the consumption of processed foods, bad food combinations, eating late at night, too much protein, to name a few, are also at the source of health problems. these statements are irrefutable science.

the benefit of a fast on juice is that you are leaving out all of these mistakes. for every mistake you leave out, there is an immediate reciprocal improvement in your overall chemistry. the reason is linked to something called vital force. something our dear writer kate sadly knows nothing about. vital force enables an immunological response to cleanse and self heal. bruises, cuts, virus, and so on. when we stop introducing harmful toxins - your vital force increases because you do not expend energy removing the toxins. the unused energy will have a direct positive impact on your immune system and your cleansing and detox processes. in other words, when you get out of the body's way - it knows exactly what to do to restore homeostasis. there are limitations - if the body's pathway to natural recovery is closed - healing may not take place. drugs and surgery often save. some times people die. there are no sure things in recovery and illness.

are you still following? please stay with me.
juice is actually a brilliant approach to a variety of problems. juice is not snake oil. it is not quackery. it's simple food.
juice works for two simple, technical, scientific reason: (1) you drink juice only, you leave out every mistake, you leave out everything including "too much protein", you leave out too much fiber, you leave out everything except supremely clean nutrients from a plant source. that's right, you get it all on a wide produce spectrum fast with juice: protein, carbohydrates, fat, organic salts, vitamins, and minerals; and (2) raw organic juice is alkalizing. it pulls endogenous acids ( toxic material ) directly from the cells and puts them back into the blood stream to be picked up and expelled through normal waste function.

cleansing is a ridiculous word. i agree. it sounds stupid. the word fasting is accurate. a fast is a dynamic way to induce a healing crisis. using juice because your including nutrition is a safe way to do. i watch many many people do very long (60 days fasts ) under skeptical medical supervision. ive witnessed and assisted people to completely ween off every medication, sugar, blood pressure, etc. why? the juice? not exactly? the juice is responsible for a small part in the "healing" to no longer need medication. it was again: what the people left out of their diets that allowed their body to heal itself. no two people fast and cleanse in a similar way because no two people have the same chemistries at the same time. some people crap a lot on a cleanse. others crap in small pellets. some people feel weak. others invigorated. some people feel hungry and have cravings. some forget about food and enjoy feeling light and rushy. the fact is on a proper juice fast you should be getting enough calories to remain efficient and feel good. cleansing is not for everyone. some people should not juice fast. some do better on a raw vegan food diet for several months. their are too many variations to explain in context to this article.

traditional scientific data stumbles over this obvious healing process. its too obvious.
- naysayers worry about fiber. they simply dont understand the biological and chemical purpose of fiber. juice has trace amounts of fiber. the inullins and the sacharides remain in the juice.
-naysayers worry about sugar in raw fruit juice. they simply dont understand the interaction of raw fruit sugar that is unprocessed and intact with companion nutrients and how it effects a reasonable chemistry.
-naysayers worry about protein. again, not understanding that protein is the problem - not the solution.

our dear writer on newser.com kate:

you're way out of your depth and over your head in this article. your style of juice fast bashing is 9 years too late. 1000 articles later, even the weakest writers include science in their writing.

im a passionate and threatened by your article because it threatens to push society back into the dark ages. the dark ages are the standard rda from the fda. the dark ages are where all people of medicine and high degree, generally toxic themselves, try to grapple with cutting age science and the dont have a clue.

kate: let me help 10 of your favorite friends drink juice for 10 days - give me the worst toxic puss bags you can find. if we can't demonstrate in 10 days radical improvement in their blood work, moods, and other vitals, i will do a 30 day twinkie cleanse with red bull chasers.

you owe your readers and apology for such low grade and recreational sport writing. you do no service to anyone, least of all the tens of thousands who heal illness and general health with juice.

Going to introduce walnut to the finishes  I hope to be open by Jan 6. This will be the 15th store open. While we also have 2 others in construction., why do people get sick in the winter?
not because cold weather breaks down the immune system. this is counter intuitive to what people think about cold weather.
actually bacteria does poorly in temperatures below 40. it's generally because people exercise less, engage more in binging and poor eating, don't get enough fresh air, and possibly depression. According to the merck medical journal depression inexplicably reduces the immune system.  people suffering from depression often produce less white blood cells than people with a positive outlook.

more people get sick from november to February because the cold weather enables the body to contract down on cellular level and that combined with bad habits create an internal environment ideal for bacteria to  proliferate. but cold and the flu are part of the detox experience and thats why nothing works to cure them. there is nothing to prescribe. anti biotics don't work. when the body is overloaded with endogenous toxic material you're likely to fall ill.
a major benefit of cleansing in the winter is that it takes no energy to digest the juices so your body has more energy to turn into vital force. vital force has a direct positive effect on the immunological system. 

What naysayers of clesnsing dont realize simply because that dont have experience the is how juices are so dynamic in pulling endogenous toxic material from the cells.juices are essentially an antidote and they are neutralizers of the acids in the cells. 

the juices neutralize the released acids which can than be picked up by the body and expelled. 

 you can't judge ph by antiquated ph chartd. juices are very alkalizing in relationship to your chemistry. juices burn clean and leave behind an alkaline ash in the blood. That's scientific and simple chemistry.

Add 2 table spoons of raw hemp seeds and two tablespoons of chia seeds : blend, Fred said you can live on that alone indefinitely., mother earth: the greenest of green drinks. prepare for thanksgiving like a pro. #fallforveggies WellandGoodNYC.com, bringing juice to work & keeping it cold just got a whole lot easier. grab a cooler tote for 2 bucks. in stores now., http://www.juicepress.com/holiday-pie.html, will you be there?, Victoria's Secret angel Doutzen Kroes tells CR Fashion Book about her love of 14 hours cold pressed apple with maca, Dear Marcus,

My name is Robert Wnorowski (nuh-rouse-key). I just started working at Juice Press 8 (brooklyn) just under a month ago and I felt the need to thank you. Bright, King, and everyone at Juice Press have taught me so much about nutrition that it has changed my life for the better. The key thing that I learned is that it’s not just about what you put into your body, but it’s what you keep out. I used to think processed sugar, meat, and dairy were all part of a balanced diet. It’s crazy how wrong I was. 

Because of this job I’m transitioning into a vegan and it’s done wonders to my body and my mind. When I started working, I was 245lbs. Today I am 219lbs! I’m at my lowest weight since before high school! My goal is to be under 200 by December 15th, and I have faith that I can do it. I’ve noticed that I am a lot less sluggish and I have plenty of energy and my mood is a lot more positive. I’ve basically taken most of the necessary steps to avoid being a fat fuck for the rest of my life. As cheesy as it sounds, I feel like a brand new man and I have you and this job to thank for that. I’m in the best shape of my life.

I look forward to chatting with you and I hope that this job can become a career in the near future. 


Regards,
Robert Wnorowski, null, dairy: there are a few common blunders that are universally accepted as truths. the united states does not claim ownership to this broad naïveté; poor nutrition is a global pandemic. one of the first common and disastrous blunders is the consumption of processed foods. the consumption of dairy is another common blunder that has its historical roots in a time when milk was unpasteurized and therefore nutrient and enzyme-rich. furthermore, livestock was not corn-fed and was not pumped full of antibiotics and growth-inducing hormones as they are today. the naturally occurring growth hormones and casein in cattle irritate the internal system of the human body, triggering the production of mucus as a defense mechanism. mucus is a wonderful breeding ground for pathogens (bacteria). non-human milk is not biochemically adapted for the human body and is too growth promoting. the growth-inducing effect of cow’s milk could be a factor in the proliferation of cancer cells and the growth of tumors. good luck telling your pediatrician you don’t want to feed your kid milk! 

cow’s milk promotes growth beyond a human’s natural capacity to grow. this is a form of stimulation, which is irritating to the inner lining of the body. the secretion of mucus, among other side effects, is the result. dairy is a well marketed myth. sources of dairy resemble nothing like they did centuries, or even 60 years ago. cows are milked about 300 days a year. for much of that time, they are pregnant. the later in pregnancy a cow is, the more hormones, including estrogen, appear in her milk and are passed onto you when you consume it. it’s not good for your body. also, dairy is pasteurized, which destroys most of its nutrients and enzymes. there’s much more to learn about the adverse effects of dairy products. milk should be consumed by the infant of the animal who produced it. vegetation is a better source of all nutrients.

Kale and the Thyroid: Kale is Goitrogenic substance

Goitrogens are substances that suppress the function of the thyroid gland by interfering with iodine uptake. The body needs iodine to make thyroid hormones. When the body tries to compensate and produce more hormones, this can cause an enlargement of the thyroid, i.e. a goiter. (common knowledge)

There was study in rats done years ago where they fed them goitrogenic vegetables (e.g. kale, spinach, and broccoli) and it affected their thyroid. i dont trust the findings of these silly rat tests.

Traditional science is funded by people with a vested interests in the outcome of studies- I don't trust some of the ridiculous things that are concluded by scientists who change their minds as often as the science around them changes.

In the context of a healthy diet and thyroid, highly goitrogenic vegetables do not cause problems. If they did, you'd also have to reduce or eliminate 50 other foods. 

Most people get enough iodine from food and drinks. If you get adequate amounts of iodine, eating reasonable amounts of goitrogenic food is not a concern. 

Cooking partially inactivates the goitrogens (except in the cases of soy and millet). 

Go back to a full spectrum diet If you feel like raw vegetables are causing a problem, or cook kale and spinach. Don't be afraid of vegetables, folks. ive watched many many people with thyroid use kale successfully - even juice cleanse with high kale and spinach juice. no problems. consult your doctor.

Certain raw foods have been identified as lightly goitrogenic. These foods include:

Cassava and cabbage, due to both foods containing thiocyanate
Soybeans and soybean products such as tofu, soybean oil, soy flour, soy lecithin (Beyond the goitrogenic properties, soy also contains genistein, which has been implicated as interfering with thyroid function in rats.) 
Pine nuts, Peanuts, Flax seed (Flax seed contains cyanide, which transforms into thiocyanate inside the body and can lead to hypothyroid syndrome.)
Millet, Strawberries, Pears, Peaches, Spinach, Bamboo shoots, Sweet Potatoes, Bok choy, Broccoli, Broccolini (Asparations) Brussels sprouts, Cabbage, Canola, Cauliflower
Chinese cabbage, Choy sum, Collard greens, Horseradish
Kai-lan (Chinese broccoli), Kale, Kohlrabi, Mizuna, Mustard greens, RadishesRapeseed (yu choy)RapiniRutabagas (swedes)Tatsoi, Turnips

Despite generally being a stimulant, caffeine acts on thyroid function as a suppressant. Some studies on rats suggest that excess caffeine, in conjunction with a lack of iodine, may promote the formation of thyroid cancers.

Fred Bisci, Ph.D. helped me compile this data. marcus antebi, Naomi Watts sips juice press watermelon juice in Allure magazine. november 2013, take a look at what a week of groceries looks like for families around the world

http://www.nutritionnews.com/food/diet-food/what-a-week-of-groceries-looks-like-around-the-world/, juice press at rag & bone and baby buggy event in soho, Agave and other raw sweeteners:

we can all agree that from a purist's perspective, NO sweetener is always better than some sweetener. that being said, there are no purists here. therefore raw agave, maple syrup, coconut nectar are GUILT FREE  sweeteners. and when used in small amounts are not any cause for the alarm words commonly used by starter foodies in the health kingdom. natural sugars and "sugar" are two misused often confused terms.
raw sugar from fruit that has not been processed or isolated has companion nutrients and a completely different  effect on the chemistry than processed and refined sugar. sugars are not evil. they are actually necessary and so is fruit.
 
stop bashing agave. fred bisci, phd who has been truly 100% raw for over 45 years consumes raw agave and he and i both understand the confusing things that are written about agave.
He frequents jp2 and googles down agave as he wishes. He's obsessed with the fountain of youth smoothie and chef Daniels creations.
the problem with too much fruit or agave sugar is that whenever there is an excess amount of sugar that can not be burned (AEROBIC) by oxygen it is often times fermented (ANEROBIC) in the body. it is fermentation that is the problem not sugar. fermentation produces alcohol. and its the alcohol that puts the white blood cells to sleep. not sugar. You are the "still" for the distillation of the alcohol from sugar & refined carbs 
rice cakes, wheat flour, most snack foods & packaged commercial products are loaded WITH THE wrong sugar that becomes a fermentation problem.

agave should never be compared to processed and isolated sweeteners like brown or white sugar, high fructose corn syrup, etc.
its just a simple uneducated statement and perpetuation of mass confusion about simple bio chemistry.
 
sugar to high degree does not suppress  the immune - 

a small dose of agave - maple - coconut and similar sugars do not adversely affect most people. the more sugar from fruit or starchy vegetables such as carrots one consumes, the more active you should be to utilize the sugar as energy rather create excess in the blood.

when agave, maple, coconut sugar is mixed with the fiber and fruits its totally harmless depending on how your body handles sugar.

THE BODY DESIRES PERFECT HEALTH AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT STATE. However, in order to achieve good health, the body must go through the elimination process. A healing crisis occurs when the body is in the process of eliminating toxins.  Reactions (see paragraph 4) may be mild to severe and last anywhere from a few days to a week or more.  One should expect to experience a healing crisis and work toward it for the elimination of toxins.

A healing crisis is the result of every body system working together to eliminate waste products and begin the task of regeneration.  A disease crisis, however, works against the body’s normal process of storing wastes and toxins in the body.  Symptoms of a healing crisis may be identical to the disease, but there is an important difference-eliminating.  A cleansing, purifying process is taking place and stored wastes are in a free flowing state.  There are times when pain during a healing crisis is of greater intensity than the building of the chronic disease which may explain why there can be a brief flare-up in one’s condition.

The healing crisis usually brings about past conditions in whatever order the body is capable of handling at that time.  People often forget the injuries or diseases they have had in the past, but are usually reminded during the healing crisis.

Reactions to a healing crisis can include any (or several) of the following; nausea, headache, sleepiness, skin eruptions, unusual fatigue, diarrhea, head or chest cold, ear infections, boils, or in any other way the body uses to loosen and eliminate toxins.  One’s body needs juice and especially KANGEN water, to help carry off the toxins.  This is a time for rest, if possible.

One may experience more than one healing crisis.  With more serious conditions, there may be small crises to go through before the final one is possible.  The person in a chronic state, or who has gone through many disease processes, must go through these processes again.  Many times the crisis will occur when one feels their very best—the body is setting the stage for eliminating.  The whole body must get into action—many people feel an energy boost the first few days which will help them as the toxins are dumped into the blood stream for elimination.

Nutritional Microbiology will open your eyes to how badly the body is ridding these toxins and most of the time your blood will look worse before it looks better.   your body wants to be healthy and balanced and as Dr. Fred Bisci says over and over “it’s a matter of what you put in and what you leave out”.  

Make sure you put in plenty of fresh, organic, raw vegetable juices and leave out the CRAP (Completely Refined And Processed) and you will achieve superior results in short order.
