Today, we are throwing it back to December 20th, 2008. The Golden State Warriors arrived in Charlotte to take on the Bobcats. With both teams far below .500 and Golden State coming off 5 straight losses, it seemed unlikely at the time that the game would feature a high amount of excitement. Apparently nobody told that to Jamal Crawford. With the Warriors top two scorers out with injury, it was obvious that Crawford would have to shoulder a lot of the load if the Warriors were to come out victorious. Crawford put on an unbelievable performance scoring 50 points on 14-26 from the field, including 5-8 from Three Point Land. Using his elite handle, Crawford attacked the basket relentless throughout the game and got to the Free Throw line 18 times, sinking 17 of those attempts. Jamal dished out 5 beautiful assists while only turning the ball over one time. Crawford’s efforts were enough to secure the Warriors a 110-103 victory and finally get another Win on the board. This special edition Diamond Throwback Jamal Crawford can be found in Throwback Thursday packs starting today!, null, Cameron Newton says him and his  "God-given" thumbs would beat Stephen Curry in NBA 2K.
