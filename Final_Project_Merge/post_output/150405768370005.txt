https://www.facebook.com/events/167355450093230/?source=1, Good Life Bar - Upcoming Events [Dec 4 - Dec 14], A quick PREEEACH from yer friends at GL:

To say this booking is a dream come true is an understatement.

If you know Good Life, several of us involved in nightlife decisions here grew up on Turntablism. Watching countless videos, going to shows and competitions. It was new and inspiring and for many of us, the catalyst that drew us to become DJs.

QBert, to us, is the Divinity of this inspiration, multiple DMC champ, the man behind Wave Twisters, world renowned for taking the craft to another level.

We are so happy he is playing Good Life :)

TBH, we're not sure what QBert's going to play or do. All we know are 3 things:

1. On Saturday December 14 QBert is going to be in the DJ Booth.

2. If you want us to keep doing bookings like this, please show up right at 10pm to support this night and be downstairs when he goes on.

3. No requests for this man or you'll be asked to leave.

THAT SAID: We are also going to party like there is no F*CKING tomorrow and we will have 2 floors of music all night so we will make sure EVERYONE enjoys themselves. So bring friends.

There's room for crab scratches and Juicy J at Fresh Produce. That's the beauty of it.

Additional Soundtrack provided by DJs Reel Drama, Evaredy and founding / resident DJs Tommee and Knife with support from UGHH.COM & JTTS.COM

$10 / 21 + / No dress code

https://www.facebook.com/events/361431203967352/?notif_t=plan_admin_added, Quick note concerning Game Over. Hello everyone! Just wanted to let y'all know that Game Over co-founder Scott Trano has left Good Life to pursue his vision and the vast undertaking of creating a full-scale video game bar in the greater Boston area full time. He will take the Game Over name with him to pursue what he has helped build. For Good Life, we will continue doing what we've been doing each and every Tuesday but simply under the name Game Night. We wish him the best of luck and plan to be his first customers sitting at the bar when the place opens. In addition, Game Over will most likely pop up at another bar in the near future as well, but in the meantime, Good Life will continue to serve the gaming community here as best we can each and every Tuesday. We hope that Game Night and Game Over can co-exist in the coming months and we truly and fully support each other's desire to expand and to serve New England gamers as we have for close to a year now., We considered not hosting today‚Äôs event, but after being glued to the images and the news for so long, I think we can all use a little escape. So come gather, play some games and let‚Äôs try and forget about this tragedy if only for a little while. The show must go on. And we‚Äôre starting ours today at 5 pm.
