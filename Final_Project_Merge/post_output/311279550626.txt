About the Cask ‘n Flagon:
The world famous Cask 'n Flagon began as a small neighborhood bar known as Oliver’s in 1969. What was once known as the little bar on the corner of Brookline Avenue and Lansdowne Street is now a landmark location for diehard Red Sox fans, sports enthusiast, college students, locals and tourists. Many have said that the Cask 'n Flagon is as synonymous to Fenway Park as the infamous Green Monster and Citgo sign. After 43 years, “The Cask” still holds the heart of Boston. Its walls are filled with black and white photographs of old time baseball greats such as Bobby Doerr (#1), Joe Cronin (#4), Carl Yastrzemski (#8), Ted Williams (#9), Carlton Fisk (#27) and many others. The tradition continues with our new location in Marshfield, MA.
