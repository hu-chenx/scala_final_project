We hope your conscience will weigh heavily on you and that you'll bring back this vase for others to enjoy.

Restaurants are public places but guests are also invited into our Dali Family/Home and for anyone to abuse the privilege of our welcoming arms is, well, shameful.

Enjoy your stolen vase but know that one day you'll also feel the pain of a broken heart when someone treats you with some thoughtless and malicious act... "
