Co-owner, Hops N Scotch & Coolidge Corner Wine & Spirits
Born and raised on Long Island, he was peeling onions for his family’s restaurant business before he could ride a bike. Six years ago, he and his business partner opened Coolidge Corner Wine & Spirits and turned it into an instant success. When the space two doors down became available, they launched a restaurant, Hops N Scotch. After a mere six months in business, it’s another homerun, and they now have roughly 30 full- and 20 part-time employees. He takes pride in the carefully curated and constantly updated inventory of his store and makes a point of having fun despite all his hard work. “I try to have a fun in life to make up for a lost childhood,” he says, and his outgoing, exuberant personality is proof. Determined to succeed and highly motivated, he believes that you have to get up in the morning and move your life in the right direction. He credits his parents for his impressive build and himself for his “life of the party” joie de vivre. Bonus points for having “lucky earlobes.”, Valentines Day
