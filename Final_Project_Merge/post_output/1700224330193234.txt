The top technology and infrastructure minds from JPMorgan Chase are working together for our kids as part of Chase’s Force For Good program. Over the next year, the Foundation and the Force For Good team will be working on finalizing the technology that was created at the Code For Good Challenge in Columbus.

I PROMISE | JPMorgan Chase & Co. Careers, We hope all of Mr. LeBron’s Schumacher CLC Wheels for Ed kids and their parents who earned a trip to tonight’s game have a blast!

Although he’s on the road, LeBron sent his Foundation team to Seiberling CLC to check in on his kids at Akron After School., If you stand at half court at Quicken Loans Arena and look to the highest point of the northeast corner, you’ll find the location of the 2014-2015 I PROMISE Land. Standing in the same location, if you turn to the Cavaliers bench and look directly at the second section in the lower bowl, above the team’s hoop, you’ll find the location of the 2015-2016 I PROMISE Land. For an explanation of the change, LeBron simply offered, “They’re my sixth man. There’s no way I’m having my kids sit in the last row.”

We hope our Akron I PROMISE Network students from Litchfield who EARNED tickets to tonight’s game have a wonderful time.

GO CAVS, When asked whether having his kids and their parents at every home game gave him an unfair advantage, with a big smile LeBron said, “Unfair advantage? Yes, absolutely, but I prefer the term ‘home court’ advantage.”

LeBron and the Foundation purchased tickets to all 40 Cavaliers home games; fittingly there are nearly 40 schools in the Akron Public Schools (APS) system where our Wheels for Education and Akron I PROMISE Network students attend. For each game, our partners at APS select ten students from a participating Wheels for Education or Akron I PROMISE Network school. Students are chosen based on their behavior and adherence to their PROMISE with LeBron. The students are given a special invitation from LeBron, a special t-shirt, two tickets to I PROMISE Land, and $10 in food vouchers for each family.

I PROMISE | Rougarou, “People from outside of Ohio may not get it, but this is really where our connection begins. Not because you play for the Cavaliers. It's the fact that you were born here, went to school here, grew up and became a man here, like so many of us did. LeBron James didn't hatch from a genetically modified superhuman shell. You weren't born with incredible basketball skills. Like the rest of Northeast Ohio, you had to work for what you have. Everything was earned. That's why it doesn't matter if you and the Cavaliers win a championship or not for your impact to be felt.”

Read the rest of Greg Swartz in-depth article below:

I PROMISE, “He may have been a thousand miles from home physically, but his heart was back there. He realized his greatest desire was to help the kids in his hometown, the ones who face the kind of struggles that LeBron dealt with growing up.”

To all of our incredible partners who are helping us change the world: thank you.

I PROMISE, Back when he moved to Miami, LeBron and the Foundation believed they could still make a difference in his hometown. Finding companies to support us as we started the program was difficult. Company after company said, “How can he help Akron kids if he’s playing in Miami?”

While these other companies questioned how LeBron could be successful, JPMorgan Chase & Co. asked, “How can we help?” And that’s just what they did.

Thank you Chase for believing in our kids and for eight incredible years of partnership.

If people laugh, block them out, because ultimately the answer to your question will help the entire classroom. The only way we get better is by learning, and together, you and I are going to learn every day."

Have fun in gym class and have fun outside, run around, go to the playground, and most importantly, be safe. If you are on the playground and you see younger kids, I want you to play with them and get them moving. Will you PROMISE me that you will do that?

#IRISH23FOREVER #PROMISEKept, "I believe my calling is much higher than being a basketball player. I can inspire people. Youth is huge to me. If I can get kids to look at me as a role model, as a leader, a superhero … those things mean so much, and that's what I think I was built for. I was put here for this lovely game of basketball, but I don't think this is the biggest role that I'm going to have."

We met Douglas and his family at the school to deliver their prize and we learned that Douglas is an avid reader who wants to grow up and protect others in the military or as a police officer. His favorite subject is math and he PROMISES to continue to do WELL in school. With Principal Summers standing by, Douglas's homeroom teacher Mr. Dombrosky shared, "Douglas is often my example. He follows procedures, has his belongings away, pencil sharpened, and is getting work done first thing in the morning." Grandma Tammy delightfully shared that being part of the Wheels for Ed family keeps Douglas focused. "We see that LeBron and his Foundation Team really are watching over us.
