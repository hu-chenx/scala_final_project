List(Just want to give you all an update.... We were forced to release or lease on Franklin st. as the build out in that location is just too overwhelming.  We are looking at 2 other spots in the local area which were already functioning restaurants in the past so we could get in there and open much quicker and for much less of an investment.  It is very disappointing because the Corinthian hall building is so beautiful and would have been a great spot for us. Not to mention all the work that has gone into that project already..Keep your fingers crossed, still hoping to be reopen by late fall., null, Do to unforeseen circumstances, Ab Fab will be closed tonight.  We will keep you informed as to our future on main st.  On a good note we are full steam ahead in our New Franklin St locaton.  We will keep everyone informed as to the GRAND OPENING DATE!!!!, So trivia will finally be happening tomorrow Wednesday March 18th... Sorry for the interruption, So it is confirmed... for those of you who haven't heard, we are RELOCATING!!!!!!  Ab Fab will be relocating to 523 Franklin st Melrose!!!

"Absolutely Fabulous on Main Street in Melrose is just that. It offers two experiences in one location: a 'high vibe' live entertainment bar scene and an intimate dining area featuring 'honest Italian food with a sophisticated global twist.' Can't make it to the hub of the universe? (that's Melrose, sports fans) Jaywalk across Beacon Street from the BBA headquarters and have lunch at Scollay Square.
