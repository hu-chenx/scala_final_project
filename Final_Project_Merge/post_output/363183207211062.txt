For those of you who didn't have the wonderful chance of ever meeting Thomas "Pup" Thwaites, here is a small paragraph written by his Great-granddaughter, Bethany Greenwood Monteith.
This is him to a T

"He always wore a Red Sox cap over his slicked back, thin white hair. His face was rigid with a couple of scabby lumps, he couldn‚Äôt help that he was old. He always maintained his memorable smile, which was usually adorned with left over Fixodent, and spoke in a sort of raspy tone. He stood hunched over, usually wearing a blue cotton sweater with grey stripes on the sleeves. His hands were fragile with knuckles the size of gumballs. His fingernails usually stayed on the longer side of short. He wore baggy, blue corduroy pants that hung low around his waist and dark work boots on his feet.", Chicken Soup, Gorton and Beans. . .
