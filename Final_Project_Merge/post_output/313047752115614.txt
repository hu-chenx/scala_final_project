FACT: To the contrary, Tequila is a type of Mezcal. By Mexican law, Tequila can be produced only in specifically designated geographic areas, primarily the state of Jalisco in west-central Mexico, and must be produced from only the Blue Agave (Weber Blue Agave, Agave Tequilana). Similar Agave spirits are produced from other regions and from other species of Agave. These other types of Agave are known locally as Maguey. Spirits made from Maguey outside of the appellation of origin are known as Mezcal. All Tequila is Mezcal, but not all Mezcal is Tequila. As an analogy, Champagne is a sparkling wine but not all sparkling wines are Champagne. In order to be Champagne, the sparkling wine must be made from a specific grape within the appellation of origin in France. Mezcal is made by 'palenqueros,' Tequila by 'Tequileros'., Tonight's Dinner Special:

Pan Seared Blue Fish(Skin On), Mango Salsa, Yellow Mole and Coconut/ English Pea Risotto.  

Get yours while they last!, Tequila is made by steaming the hearts of the blue agave plant, one of approximately 136 species of agave grown in Mexico. Once steamed, the hearts are minced to a pulp, combined with water, and fermented, producing an alcoholic liquid that's then distilled and bottled., Your libation awaits!
