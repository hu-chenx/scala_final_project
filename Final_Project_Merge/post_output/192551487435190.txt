In a time when restaurants and bars change seemingly by the day, I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished. 
We're thriving. We're loved. And we provide a great product. 
Huge thanks to our staff that have been there for all these years!(We've never lost a bartender, only added some)You guys are amazing!!!  Thank you so much!
Thanks to Dave Sammarco for getting our kitchen going, and to chef Tom and Adam Ganson for taking it to levels I never imagined. 
Thanks to all of the bands that have played over the years. You've provided entertainment every night since we opened, and you've given us an amazing reputation!! We are proud to be known as a go-to spot for live music in the Boston area. 
Thanks to all of my family and friends for all the support over the years; especially my lovely girlfriend for putting up with me. 
And huge thanks to my stepfather and business partner Chris Whitney who does more behind the scenes than you could ever imagine.
Thanks to Robert Elliott for all of your help and support. We would have been closed after a week without your generosity and advice. 
Last, but certainly not least, thank you to all of our loyal customers!! 
You've shown up day in and day out to support us, and I am eternally grateful!
Thank you all for supporting local family-owned business. 
I know you have plenty of options for places to go, and the fact that you choose Bull McCabe's so often is truly humbling.

Nephrok Allstars at 10:00., New full page ad in the Weekly Dig., From the Improper Bostonian:

Somerville’s Union Square can seem dead on a Sunday, but the atmosphere changes when you enter Bull McCabe’s. The bar’s packed with bodies nodding to the airtight breakbeats of Tommy Benedetti from roots-reggae futurists John Brown’s Body. Guitarists Johnny Trama (Ghosts of Jupiter) and Jeffrey Lockhart inject biting licks. Bass grooves ooze from funk veteran Aaron Bellamy, who’s stepped up since Benedetti’s JBB mate Nate Edgar moved to Brooklyn. Guitarist Van Martin slides in for a Jerry Garcia-toned rock lead. And singer Boubacar Diabate pops in for a tune. There are also horn lines from rotating players that can include Timo Shanko (Fully Celebrated Orchestra/G. Love & Special Sauce) or Dana Colley (Morphine).

Welcome to Dub Apocalypse, which Benedetti and Edgar began at Matt Murphy’s in Brookline before securing their base at McCabe’s two years ago. “With a residency, if you’re playing every week, the ideal thing is to keep it as fresh as possible,” Benedetti says. “So that’s why we started incorporating players from different bands and genres.… You keep people coming back because each show’s a little different.”

The drummer anchors the band’s core group of players, calling shots from a master list of original tunes as well as Studio One grooves from Jamaica. “They’re timeless rhythms and melodies and horn lines, and we’re using that as a platform to launch our own inspiration,” Benedetti says of his improvisation-savvy crew, which shares similarities and occasional membership with the world/jazz/groove collective Club d’Elf. “To play in this band, you’ve got to have elephant ears. That’s when it really happens.”

Dub Apocalypse hasn’t released any records (“It’s a hard thing to capture in the studio,” he says), but he endorses tapers who post shows online. “There’s something in it for people who like soul, funk, reggae or jazz or Phish or whatever,” he says. “The more people that can hear the music, the better for all.”, Perfect night for patio dining. 
New cocktail menu with some amazing funky drinks from David Wells.

Parking lot is available after 6:30 M-F, after noon on Saturday, and all day Sunday. 
We are paying a substantial amount of money to rent the parking lot. 
Because of that, we need to make sure the people parking in the lot are actually INSIDE Bull McCabe's. 
We can't have people parking here, coming in for a drink and then heading off to the rest of the square. 
Cars belonging to people who are not at Bull McCabe's will be towed. 
And, any cars left after 1:15 AM will be towed as well. 
No double-parking. If there's no spot, please find street parking. 
I don't mean to sound harsh, but this is a very big financial investment for us, and I want to make sure there are spots open for people coming to Bull's.
