Hands down, the best wings I have ever had. And I have had some serious wings. The "Honey Hot" wings are the best ones. The others are fantastic as well. 
Do NOT forget the sweet potato fries. I am salivating right now just thinking about them. 

The burgers are good, but doesn't touch the wings or sweet potato fries. And remember, they only accept--

Oh man do I love my wings and does Buff's Pub deliver. Came here on a nice Saturday afternoon and wasn't too busy. Wait staff was very attentive.

The wings were amazing and I know my wings. The flavors were explosive and the wings juicy.

My only complaint which I didn't mind too much, but my girlfriend (and I'm sure others) is that almost all of their sauces are spicy. They only have 1 or 2 that aren't spicy, but I didn't try those as they didn't seem too interesting.

We also got sweet potato fries and those were some of the best sweet potato fries I have ever had. 

The prices were great and the food was amazing. Definitely recommend.

Buff's is a cute little place.  It's a bar/pub.  The stuffed buffalo head is a nice touch.  The restaurant was pretty empty on the evening of July 3.  The Harpoon IPA on tap didn't have the best head- maybe it was towards the end of the barrel.  The waitstaff were pleasant and efficient.  We decided to do some chicken wing research.  We had an order of old school Buffalo wings, extra hot and well done.  The wings were cooked perfectly.  Buff's extra hot sauce is equivalent to medium strength elsewhere.  It was good.  We tried some of their garlic/cheese/sriracha wings in the interest of science.  The main flavor that came through was that of the garlic.  There was a hint of sriracha and no detectable cheese.  The wings were fine, though.  I am a chicken wing traditionalist.  We also tried the chili-cheese fries, strictly for research purposes.  They were very good.  NB:  Cash only!

Overall a pleasant experience and a good meal.  Buff's has very good wings that would hold their own against most other places.

I really like buffs pub for a good neighborhood place with good beer and food!  Love the turkey tips.  I have frequented buffs often over the last 6-7 years since I have lived in watertown and speak highly of it..  however I do have an issue.... The last 2 times I have been there this year (March and June 2014) there is one waitress that is so miserable to us.  Both times I have been with the same friends ... The whole point of us going to buffs is to have some drinks, catch up and have dinner.  If were still sipping on our drinks post dinner talking we usually get dirty looks.  In March we were flat out told that people were waiting and we should wrap it up.   This past June I was literally afraid to ask for a water even though I had already had 2 beers... I was dying of thirst I was afraid we would start to get the dirty looks again if we lingered any longer.   From now on I think we will meet elsewhere.

I was well aware to bring cash here and was able to find parking just a block or two away. It seems like they're the two major complaints for Buffs. For those that don't already know, there's a public parking garage within 100 yards of the place, so you really shouldn't knock the place for not having parking options. 

The hubs and I had to wait about 10 mins for a table, so we grabbed a beer from the bartender and waited at the front of the restaurant. I asked one of the servers for a recommendation and they said to go for the honey hot. When it came time to order, I took the suggestion and opted for the honey hot plate with onion rings, along with stuffed jalapenos as an appetizer. The hubs had a regular buffalo hot plate with fries.  The food was GREAT! I really havent ever tried anything like the honey hot before. I used to work at Buffalo Wild Wings and tried a ton of sauces while I worked there, so I thought this would be similar to a honey BBQ with a little kick. Boy was I wrong, YUM! The fries looked hand cut and were piping hot. The jalopenos had somewhat of a chipolte cream cheese in the middle, which was pretty unique as well. 

On top of the excellent food... the Service!!! Oh man! Everyone was extremely friendly, courteous, and quick to refill our beers. We actually tipped more than 20% because we felt so well taken care of. Rock on, Buffs! You guys are awesome!, BUFF‚ÄôS PUB ‚ÄúSUMMER BREEZE BURGER‚Äù
