"I‚Äôm from Boston, and my trips home usually involve eating at old standbys (oh hello, Eastern Standard). But once I‚Äôd heard Tim and Nancy Cushman -- the couple behind the phenomenal sushi legend O Ya -- had opened a Japanese tavern of sorts, exceptions were made. The casual vibe is almost disconcerting -- you feel like you‚Äôre somehow in a Japanese-inflected New England sports bar -- but once you get the food, you realize this is truly a Cushman joint. 

The marriage of the Japanese izakaya with some American angles almost made many of the dishes feel Hawaiian -- the tuna poke for instance, with roasted macadamia dressing, and its play on ‚ÄúSpam,‚Äù which actually includes foie gras -- but there were winners from all sides of the menu. The spicy tuna roll was basically smokey, the spicy ramen with the soy egg made you feel like you should probably slurp the entire bowl, and the Hojoko cheeseburger (with American cheese, huzzah!) is essentially what would happen if Burger King sold its soul to a genie to make one fantastic flame-broiled burger. And this is all before we‚Äôve even gotten to the drinks, like the exquisite Hato made with shochu, mezcal, grapefruit, cinnamon, and soda. Needless to say, it looks like I‚Äôve got a new standby. -- KA", Ho-Ho-Hojoko Holiday Party!, STILL NEED PRESENTS?

Let's Rock. #bmas #hojokorocks, "Is the Hojoko burger the best thing you'll find at this funky, Fenway-side izakaya, the kicky new sibling to fancy sushi icon O Ya? Maybe, maybe not. All the quirky Japanese grub here is, to use a highly technical phrase, freaking awesome. So, maybe you'd rather some "Spam" (read: foie gras) sushi rolls, or an excellent okonomiyaki with smoky bacon and truffle Kewpie. But the burger ($14), a chuck and Wagyu short-rib patty topped with American cheese, dashi pickles and a spectacular "special sauce," is most emblematic of Hojoko's overall approach. It's seriously great food that doesn't take itself seriously.

Leave your leftovers behind and enjoy the gorgeous weather tonight with us! #kanpai #hojokolovesyou, "Hojoko‚Äôs odd-yet-familiar version of the cocktail is instructive: If we don‚Äôt even have the same orange juice that we did when the drink was conceived, couldn‚Äôt it be high time we stopped obsessing about how the Ward Eight was made a really long time ago? Perhaps the only way to truly reclaim a historically not-so-great drink‚Äîor any drink, for that matter‚Äîis to acknowledge that its identity need not be fixed. It‚Äôs a mindset that, in its own way, is entirely in keeping with the Ward Eight‚Äôs unwieldy heritage."

Moving into the new music-themed Verb Hotel is Hojoko, a "high-energy izakaya," according to a release. The Japanese pub will be the latest from O Ya owners chef Tim Cushman and his wife, sake sommelier Nancy Cushman. O Ya, of course, is consistently rated among the top restaurants in Boston. It's also among the priciest. So the combination of a Japanese pub in a young, trendy hotel, armed with an irreverent name (we suspect the "Hojo" is a nod to the Howard Johnson that once occupied the site), might suggest we'll soon have the opportunity to get some moderately priced Cushman cuisine.
