The winemaker, Doug Tunnel, only makes a small amount of it in the best years in honor of his mother. Here is the story about her and what a remarkable person she was:

She was known around Carlton, Oregon for racing her Kentucky Whip at full speed across the old wooden bridge on the edge of town just as the sun was coming up, raising the ire of sleeping townspeople throughout the summer of ’26. She was a local girl formidable enough to compete academically in the “man’s world” of a college campus in the 1930’s. Evelyn was both a headstrong horsewoman and a Queen of the May whose favorite color was lavender.
“Evelyn’s” is mom’s wine; a blend of barrels selected at the discretion of her son, the winemaker. It is our most limited bottling. Not all vintages lend themselves to fashioning a velvet glove around an iron–fisted structure. We blend and bottle “Evelyn’s” from a selection of six different clones of Pinot Noir in vintages of exceptional quality., null, For anyone out at the Cathedral School voting today, stop by for a free hot mulled cider with the purchase of food at the bar!

Long ago, during the 17th century, the O’Neills and O’Reillys were two revolutionary Irish families. They formed a rowing competition to reserve rights to some highly regarded land. The two rowing teams agreed that the first to touch the land, after rowing across the lake, would become ruler of the land. O’Neill’s boat was falling behind so a member of the crew grabbed his own sword, cut off his hand and threw it ashore, winning the title to rule the land. This land still remains in the family.

It starts tonight!, Handmade Gnocchi,
Duck Confit,
Radicchio,
Fresh Parmesan 

The word gnocchi means "lumps", and derives from nocchio, a knot in the wood. It has been a traditional Italian pasta type of Middle Eastern origin since Roman times. It was introduced by the Roman Legions during the enormous expansion of the empire into the countries of the European continent. In the past 2000 years each country developed its own specific type of small dumplings, with the ancient gnocchi as their common ancestor. In Roman times, gnocchi were made from a semolina porridge-like dough mixed with eggs, and are still found in similar forms today, particularly Sardinia's malloreddus (although they do not contain eggs).
The use of potato is a relatively recent innovation, occurring after the introduction of the potato to Europe in the 16th century. We hope you enjoy., Hanger Steak

Day is coming. Don't forget to make reservations. It's on a Sunday so
Saturday night reservations for non-Valentine's plans may be a bit
difficult this coming weekend as well. Go Saints!, Seared Scallops with Fingerling Potato, Prosciutto, Wild Mushroom, Black Truffle Vinaigrette  ,  Chef Stephen Sherman demonstrates his spin on an American classic....the Apple Crostata, topped with Cinnamon Ice Cream. 

A crostata is an Italian baked dessert tart, and a form of pie. It is traditionally prepared by folding the edges of the dough over the top of the jam/marmalade filling, creating a more "rough" look, rather than a uniform, circular shape. The jams that are traditionally used as a filling are cherries, peaches, apricots, berries. For our purposes we decided to go with sliced granny smith apples. 

For the pate brisee (sweet pastry crust) one batch of the recipe calls for:
 
            2 C       All purpose flour
            ¼ C      granulated sugar
            ½ tsp    salt
            ½ #       cold, cubed butter
            ¼ C      ice water, give or take
 
for this batch of dough, you probably need 4 apples, apple butter, softened butter for topping the apples and a cinnamon sugar mixture of 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon.
 
The emphasis for this recipe is really on the dough and the technique.  You can fill the Crostata with whatever fruit, or combination of fruits you like., Jim Ansara is in Haiti getting it done.
