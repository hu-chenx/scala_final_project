Favorite New Ros√©: 2015 Dom. de Saint Ser, Cuv√©e Prestige Rose

I tasted this wine for the first time last month, and I was floored. Provence ros√©s are not a new thing, but the quality of what is coming to the U.S. is generally good, but quaffable and rarely exciting. This one is exceptional. First of all, the vineyards are all biodynamically farmed, and the wine has such prickly minerality, impressive strawberry, lavender and grapefruit aromas, and a long, acid-lifted finish. Dana Drufresne from Bird Rock Imports presented it to me, and she agreed; this could be one of the most special Provence ros√©s being produced right now.

Little kids with their parents at Barcelona are always delighted to discover that one of Spain‚Äôs classic dishes is meatballs in tomato sauce, called albondigas. We don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a culture in the world that doesn‚Äôt like good meatballs. The secret is to be generous with the fat (no substituting ground sirloin for the ground chuck and pork) and not over-mix or over-handle the meatballs before cooking. Work them quickly and make sure they stay cold during the mixing process., Thanks to Emma Noyes from Harvard University Spoon University - Harvard for the feature!, But first, BRUNCH., Barcelona chefs ready for ‚ÄúEat.

‚ÄúA negroni is my favorite cocktail to order when I‚Äôm at a new bar ‚Äì it‚Äôs my benchmark of how I judge the quality of a bar. If they make a great negroni, then I‚Äôll bet they make a lot of great drinks. If they don‚Äôt make it very well, oh well, even a mediocre negroni can be enjoyable (sort of like pizza). And what if they don‚Äôt know how to make a negroni? No problem, it‚Äôs 3 ingredients that every bar has, all equal parts.

I didn‚Äôt invent the white negroni, although this recipe is my original version of a white negroni. Simply swapping out red vermouth with white vermouth, and campari with gran classico bitters is what makes it ‚Äúwhite.‚Äù Its slightly less bitter, and little more round, but hits all the sweet spots that make negronis so enjoyable.‚Äù - Gretchen Thomas, Wine and Spirits Director, You ask us what tapas-style is? Here you go... 

(photo courtesy of: @jessicaglitter - via Instagram), "What I like about Barcelona Wine Bar is convenience, and the price.  Barcelona Wine Bar is a much larger restaurant than many other South End spots so the wait may not always be as long as elsewhre.  Price-wise, because Barcelona Wine Bar is a mid-sized, well-established chain, they have the advantage of business experience and being able to purchase beautiful product for all the restaurants at once which may help with cost.  Most of the dishes we ordered were fabulous." - Leah's Life: Pearls & Oysters

Ancient Catalunya was once a country that stretched from northern Spain up into southeastern France and over to the islands off the coast of Italy.

"Ahhh, the green fairy, la fee verte, the wormwood angel.  A bright green liquor with an aroma that will be sure to put hair on your chest, absinthe has always had a bit of mystery surrounding it.

Absinthe‚Äôs main ingredients are fennel, green anise, and wormwood.  First, let‚Äôs clear the air‚Ä¶ absinthe won‚Äôt make you hallucinate.

Bloody Mary, anyone?, Table-side jam√≥n, anyone?, Top ten wine buzz words to make you sound like a wine PRO!

"As a sommelier, one of the most powerful tools I have is my words. They help me to paint the picture and tell the story of each wine. With words a wine professional can take a bottle of wine you may never have tasted it and give you a true sense of what it has to offer. It is because these words are so important to us, that wine basically has its own language. Sometimes when I‚Äôm talking to someone about a bottle of wine, I look up and realize they are looking at me as if I‚Äôm speaking in foreign tongues. With that in mind I thought we‚Äôd discuss some of the most common descriptors or color words I come across on a daily basis."

http://www.barcelonawinebar.com/blog/top-ten-wine-buzz-words-to-know/, Why hello..., Just a "casual" Txakoli pour..., Cheers to the weekend!, And it's out!

"But Barcelona has greater culinary ambitions, boasting one of the longer Spanish menus in town, with many small plates too generous to be considered tapas, a welcome variety of vegetable dishes, a few substantial entrees, and a handful of paellas and mixed grills for two or more diners. Paper-thin slices of jam√≥n mangalica ($11 small, $22 large), a Hungarian pig cured in Spain in the style of jam√≥n ib√©rico, is a sweet, delicate knockout of a ham, hand-carved by the chef table side right of the hoofed haunch." - Improper Bostonian Magazine

http://www.improper.com/going-out/chained-heat/, "Sure, the wine is obviously the focus at the new South End location of Barcelona Wine Bar, but for those in a more liquor-driven mood, there are some creative cocktails awaiting you (not to mention a lively bar scene). For a little bit of heat, try The Enabler ‚Äî Flor de Ca√±a gold rum, green chartreuse, lime juice, mint, salt, and habanero shrub. Or there's the wintery Bourbon Spice Rack ‚Äî Four Roses bourbon, Doc's maple syrup, lemon juice, Scrappy's cardamom and lavender bitters, and 'giant' ice." - Eater Boston

"It‚Äôs been an intense year of traveling (I visited Spain five times!), tasting, and learning.
