IN THE KITCHEN The Watertown couple behind Manow Thai Kitchen, which recently opened on Beacon Street in Newton, say their aim is to serve the same traditional dishes they would get at small roadside restaurants in their native Phetchabun, Thailand.

Phajonchai Unseethaharuthai, known as P.J., and his wife, Waree Yimsiriwatthana, are the owners and chefs at the storefront restaurant, where they specialize in the foods he learned to prepare as a teenager in Thailand cooking for his younger sisters and she learned from her family of food-loving street vendors who would set up their stalls near the local markets each morning.

“We try to make food just like we make it for our family, and just like we would eat back home,” she said.

THE LOCALE The small, 22-seat restaurant, in a strip mall next to the Mobil gas station at the Four Corners intersection, Beacon and Walnut streets, is well set up for quick takeout, with the register right inside the front door. The friendly servers, newly painted lime-green walls, and light wood accents also make a comfortable atmosphere for eating in.

ON THE MENU For the extensive menu, the owners say, they chose dishes that they both like to eat, and are comfortable making.

The dishes are from all parts of Thailand and include the hot, creamy, coconut-milk curries from the north, as well as the dried chili dishes that southern Thailand is known for.

We tried the green curry with chicken ($7.25 for a lunch combo, and $10.95 at dinner) with still-crisp green beans and peppers, eggplant, Thai basil, and julienned bamboo shoots in a coconut chili bath that had just the right spicy heat for our American palates.

The owners say they would turn the heat up for their Thai customers, and are happy to be accommodating and adjust the amount of the fresh green and red chilies, or dried chilies, used in their dishes.

As a lunch combo, the green curry came with rice on the side, a choice of a crispy spring roll or pork dumpling, and a choice of chicken tom yum soup with red chili flakes speckling the lime- and fish sauce-flavored broth, wonton soup, or the veggie tofu soup, which came overflowing with a selection of broccoli, pea pods, carrots, and other vegetables just cooked through to keep their crunch.

P.J. honed his skills working in kitchens at Thai restaurants throughout the area, he said, and along with his two assistants does most of the prep work and to-order cooking.

But he defers to his wife when it comes to making the chicken, pork, and beef meatballs that are offered as appetizers drizzled with spicy sweet and sour sauce ($6.50) and in many of the big bowls of noodle soups.

“They are very different from spaghetti and meatballs,” she said, searching for just the right word to describe the firmer texture, more like an American hot dog in feel than a soft Italian meatball.

Yimsiriwatthana makes the meatballs by hand in large batches several times a week and cooks them fresh, she said. She uses a very specific kneading, shaping, and slow poaching technique she said she learned from relatives, and has taken her a long time to master.

The teenagers who ate soups full of the meatballs would say all that practice paid off.

The simple-sounding Thai noodle soup, which comes with a choice of chicken, pork, beef, seafood, or veggie (from $8.25 to $9.50) starts with a rich chicken broth, and includes the meatballs, fresh rice noodles, bean sprouts, and loads of fresh cilantro.

The owners say they try to keep their dishes authentic. For example, the masaman curry with beef ($7.95 at lunch, $12.95 at dinner) has a lot of beef, but just potatoes, carrots, and peanuts, and no green vegetables, which some other Thai restaurants include.

“We make it like we eat it when we are home in Thailand,” Yimsiriwatthana said.

Manow Thai Kitchen, 1138 Beacon St., Newton, 617-244-2858, www.manowthaikitchen.com. The restaurant is open Monday through Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. for lunch, and 3 to 10 p.m. for dinner. It is open for lunch on Sundays, from noon to 3 p.m. No liquor license.
