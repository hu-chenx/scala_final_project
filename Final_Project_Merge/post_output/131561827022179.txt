BEEF STEW on special for this cold day - 5.99/bowl (usually 6.99), It was an incredible rainbow sunset over the deli recently. Was on the first day of our new hours, so I am taking it as a sign that it was the correct path to take. Just can't wait for Inna, mom, to return next week so we can really get the dinner program going and offer more selections and even delivery----and of course we all miss her!, What's at the end of the rainbow? Falafel and Shawarma and Shakshuka!, Seemed like everybody came over after the Red Sox parade so we were swamped right at noon and continuing till after 2... think a couple people waited even 30 minutes.  Sorry for the wait! Hope the food was worth it. We're working on being more efficient but it's difficult to plan for something like this. To be safe, if you're ever in a rush call ahead, maybe even 30 minutes ahead if it's brunch/lunch time.
  Looking forward to a quieter Sunday tomorrow but it will probably get really busy like last week, so call ahead if you don't want to wait too long. Have a great weekend everybody!, WEEKEND BRUNCH

I'd like to bake some gluten-free treats for the occasions. Some quick brainstorming with Becky has resulted in the following:
1) Peppermint Chocolate Enrobed* and Candy Cane Encrusted Chocolate Chip Cookies-- my chocolate chip cookies dipped in minty chocolate and put on crushed candy canes to cool. Too Cool Too right?! (Dairy-free) *Enrobed is the technical term for covered-in-chocolate, it makes me feel like a real chocolatier!
2) Gingerbread Men and Women! (Vegan)
3) Buche de Noel! (aka Yule Log) Never made one nor eaten one and can't wait to do both! (Very NOT dairy-free NOR egg-free) (see random web pic attached)
~~ If you're interested in any of the above, please order ahead for Monday -- otherwise I will probably just make small batches for sale at the deli (and as gifts for staff). ~~

I will also have the following available Saturday and Monday:
-Pumpkin Pie! Per popular demand, baking another batch of this killer pie! (GF and Dairy-free, I use coconut milk).
-Carrot Cake Cupcakes with Coconut Frosting

Sweet Potato Casserole
Honey Glazed Chicken, Did you order Corned Beef on Saturday afternoon or Monday? If you did, you were probably asking yourself the same question: "is this corned beef?" Well we had an OOPS, and what you got was actually just cooked brisket, uncured (it should have become our Sweet & Sour Brisket). So it tasted just like plain cooked brisket without the flavor and texture benefits of curing for a week (corning), or cooking for an additional 3 hours in our S&S sauce.

Definitely the type of mistake that is unexpected (something we thought was "unmistakeable," wasn't), so it should never happen again. We are very sorry to those of you who didn't get what you ordered -- and especially to you, new customer, that got 1/2# of it! We very much hope we'll see you again so you can try the real stuff!, ~Special~
