Take me down 
I’m feeling now
And if I move on
I admit you're gone
I ain't ready
I’ll hold steady
I’ll hold you in my arms

You’re locked inside my heart
Your melody’s an art
I wont let the terror in I’m stealing time 
Through the eye of the needle

Step and repeat
Tears fall to the beat
Smile through pain
Feel the acid rain
I ain't ready 
I’ll hold steady
I’ll hold you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms

You’re locked inside my heart
Your melody’s an art
I wont let the terror in I’m stealing time 
Through the eye of the needle

My bags heavy
Been filled by me
They weigh me down 
Carry them round
It’s all mine all mine
I am blinded by the eye of the needle
