Straight from McLaren‚Äôs Formula 1 headquarters in Woking, UK, the MP4-12C is the ultimate no compromise sports car. Featuring a 3.8 liter V8 twin turbo engine, with 620 horsepower, the 12C does 0-60 in just 3.1 seconds. The 12C is available as a coupe or convertible (spider) version, and the Spider features a retractable hardtop which can be used while driving up to 19mph. The McLaren also  features a state of the art carbon fiber monocoque chassis and a revolutionary suspension system, which  make the  McLaren 12C one of  the most exhilarating and technologically advanced sports cars available today, not to mention the dihedral doors look amazing. What better way to start off the New Year than in one of these incredible dream cars!, Today‚Äôs ‚ÄòHoliday Dream Car‚Äô: Ferrari  FF

Ferrari is known for making some of the best sports cars on the planet, and the FF is no exception. Taking the luxury market by storm, this 2+2 seats four comfortably, while its 651 hp V12 rockets the FF from 0-60 in 3.5 seconds. It is also the first Ferrari to offer four wheel drive by use of a revolutionary four wheel drive system that only activates when traction is low, ensuring the feel of a true grand touring Ferrari V12. To add to this, the FF has a slew of available interior amenities such as front and rear cameras, a rear seat entertainment system, ventilated and heated seats, and all of the comforts you would expect to find in a luxury automobile, which makes the Ferrari FF the ULTIMATE daily driver., Today‚Äôs ‚ÄòHoliday Dream Car‚Äô: Maserati GranTurismo MC

Although similar to the GranTurismo Sport, the MC distinguishes itself with an added flair comprised of a more aggressive suspension, brakes and body. Adding to its distinction the bumpers, fenders and hood showcase definitive accents and sharper lines. The GranTurismo MC does 0-60 in 4.5 sec. topping out at 189mph and the exhaust, which has less restriction, provides a louder note that only a Ferrari engine developed for Maserati can accomplish. But it doesn't stop there - on the interior, flashes of carbon fiber complete the aggressive feel the GranTurismo MC so proudly boasts. Speed, form and function - what's not to love?, Today‚Äôs ‚ÄòHoliday Dream Car‚Äô: Panamera S Hybrid

Since its debut in 2008, the Porsche Panamera has taken the sports sedan-world by storm thanks to its one-of-a-kind look and feel. With fuel consumption of 22 mpg in city and 30 mpg in hwy, this unique hybrid can go 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds; with a top Speed of 167 mph. Full hybrid system can power the Panamera by the gasoline engine only, by electric motor only or a combination of both. On full electric mode, the Panamera can drive up to 53 mph. A drive in the Panamera quickly transforms into your own personal concert thanks to its Bose sound system that rocks (11) speakers and LED lighting package for your entertainment pleasure. Holiday road trips never sounded so good!, TGIF! Did you enter our Dwyane Wade signed basketball GIVEAWAY?, Today‚Äôs ‚ÄòHoliday Dream Car‚Äô:  Aston Martin Vantage	 

The Aston Martin Vantage is a modern high-performance icon. The Vantage boasts its own unmistakable character, yet possesses the same core qualities of power, beauty and soul. Whether fitted with the vocal 4.7 liter V8 or sensational 6.0 ‚Äì liter V12, each Vantage is bestowed with phenomenal performance, agility and dynamism together with the refinement and tractability to excel in everyday driving. Gracefully manicured with Piano Black Facia Trim and a full-grain leather interior, the Vantage is one unique and extraordinary Aston Martin.  It is without question, one of the world‚Äôs greatest engines clothed in one of the most stylish models ever designed. A sports car so timelessly handsome, it‚Äôll leave you feeling like James Bond., Today‚Äôs ‚ÄòHoliday Dream Car‚Äô: Audi A8

The low, broad athletic stance embodies the spirit of the Audi brand. The A8‚Äôs elegant profile contains 3 lines converging to form its critically acclaimed and dramatic look. Under the hood, an engine boasting 372hp and 328lb/ft torque lies beneath. On the interior, you‚Äôll slip into therapeutically designed 22 way power adjustable seats with heat, vent and massage made of leathers of the finest quality. Exotic wood finishes, hand burnished and trimmed with silver accentuate the cabin, touched off with ambient lighting that be adjusted to your mood, including personalized color profiles and brightness control. But the A8 doesn‚Äôt stop there: built off of an aircraft grade aluminum space frame ‚Äì a feature found in only a handful of vehicles. One ride and we‚Äôre certain you‚Äôll be part of the Audi family for life., We'll take one of everything on the Miami.com holiday gift guide!, Today‚Äôs ‚ÄòHoliday Dream Car‚Äô:  Maserati GranTurismo Sport 

The perfect blend of luxury, comfort and sportiness. It can be as sporty and fun as you desire, but is also perfectly comfortable for long trips thanks to its grand touring setup and suspension. A favorite feature of the GranTurismo Sport is its exhaust which gives a loud note and the feeling as if you‚Äôre behind the wheel of race car. The Sport powers through with 454hp thanks to its 4.7 V8 engine developed and built by Ferrari for Maserati. The shifting time is 50% faster in the GranTurismo Sport than the MC, and can go from 0 to 60 in 4.7secs, topping out at 185mph. The most captivating thing you‚Äôll experience with the GranTurismo Sport is how you‚Äôll never want to stop driving it., Today‚Äôs ‚ÄòHoliday Dream Car‚Äô:  Cayenne S Hybrid

Porsche tailors it‚Äôs hybrids to the expectation of a sports car buyer. A proficient blend of performance and fuel economy, the Cayenne S hybrid averages 20mpg in city and 24mpg on highway.

Browsers and Buyers Now Have Instant, Anytime Access to Porsche Product Intelligence, 
from Specs and Reviews to Engine Sounds and More 

ATLANTA ‚Äì July 6, 2011 ‚Äì Porsche Cars North America today announced a convenient new way for consumers to do more than just ‚Äúkick the tires‚Äù when they visit a Porsche dealership after hours, or when they prefer to be ‚Äújust looking‚Äù while in the showroom. Shoppers now have the power to see, read and even hear the inside story about Porsche vehicles on display at participating Porsche dealers, whenever it suits their busy schedules. The new program, a first for an automotive luxury brand, taps into the technology of mobile tags and smartphone tag readers adding rich content and interactive functionality for a high-performance, personalized shopping experience.

Each scan of a mobile tag-equipped Porsche automatically opens a micro website utilizing the phone‚Äôs built in web browser and features a wealth of specific product information to the exact car being browsed, including vehicle videos, leading press reviews and even the unique sound of the Porsche model‚Äôs engine. A customer can also provide contact information for fast follow-up by a Porsche sales professional, or can browse anonymously.

‚ÄúPorsche customers enjoy both performance and technology and are using their mobile devices to help make vehicle purchasing decisions,‚Äù said Michael Bartsch, chief operating officer of Porsche Cars North America. ‚ÄúThe dealers that have begun using mobile tags in their showrooms, have noted positive feedback from their sales team as well as greater customer engagement and enthusiasm.‚Äù

Since the launch of a pilot program in early June, 11 Porsche dealers have already implemented the program, with 184 on the way. According to a 2009 Morgan Stanley study, one-third of all digital information is now viewed using mobile devices, and by 2013 that number is expected to reach 50 percent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been quite exciting to serve as a test-dealer for Porsche‚Äôs new mobile tags. The technology affords our customers the opportunity to receive quick, up-to-the-minute information on our inventory,‚Äù says Ken Gorin, president and CEO of THE COLLECTION. ‚ÄúWe pride ourselves on Event Marketing, so the new program has already proven especially useful in translating off-site displays into in-dealership sales.‚Äù

In addition to making the Porsche shopping experience even more convenient, Porsche has designed new web and mobile tools that help on-the-go customers quickly locate and connect with dealer sales and service information. The latest innovations include Smart Mobile for touch-screen handheld devices, featuring customized dealership information including available inventory, special offers and easy driving directions. Also new is a location-based, mobile version of the Porsche Dealer locator where customers can now find local dealers, search all dealers nationwide or find their nearest service center via their smartphone.

Additionally, Porsche dealers can now utilize the new SalesPad Apple¬Æ iPad 2 application to instantly display and share information on a particular car while also tapping into the Porsche Car Configurater, which allows the customer to easily custom design the Porsche of their dreams. The ability to access a library of extensive model information, including a national inventory search increases the likelihood of finding the exact Porsche the customer wants, in stock.

For more information on the program or to locate a Porsche dealer, visit www.Porsche.com/usa., Audi exclusive is a customization program that makes dreams come true by allowing owners to personalize their car with wheels, special paints, and high-grade interior trim.
