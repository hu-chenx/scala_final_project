#BuiltForCharging, Troy Brosnan | Fun can’t make you faster – Fun is just a three-letter word for distraction. In this day and age of racing, you have to be focused, dedicated and willing to sacrifice anything that will get in the way of you and the top step of that podium. Fun may be the reason you threw a leg over your bike and charged it down the scariest, fastest and biggest lines you could in the first place, but fun alone can’t make you faster. Having fun on your bike may give us an escape from the every day mundane, fun may give you a chance to experience something that many are not brave enough to attempt, but fun can’t make you faster. 

Troy Brosnan walked away from the last round of the UCI World Cup Downhill as the new Overall leader going into the recent month long break. He has spent that last month having nothing but fun on his bike. Exploring new terrain, challenging himself to new environments and conditions, pushing harder than ever…all in the sprit of fun. As Troy enters the next round of the World Cup this weekend in Mont Saint Anne, he will do so for the first time with all eyes on him – as the leader, not a follower. A leader who has been out having nothing but fun doing what he loves on two wheels. But fun can’t make you faster.

#BuiltForCharging, RockShox Tech pill: RS-1 | Brake Hose Routing 

Proper brake hose routing on the RockShox RS-1 is important to make sure your hose is not rubbing on your wheel or tire, and to make sure the brake hose is not damaging the finish of your new fork.

The Maxle Ultimate on your RS-1 is new and functions differently than our other Maxles. Closing the lever squeezes the fork dropouts together along the length of the axle. This is critical to the performance of the RS-1 and the Predictive Steering hub. It is also critical to position the lever of your Maxle Ultimate correctly, to avoid damaging your RS-1's carbon fiber upper.

Bikes that have wheels and tires of gigantic proportion – and we’re not talking about 29ers here. The thing is, even though fat bikes were first created to float on top of snow and sand, they’re just too damn fun not to ride on dirt. So how do you amplify your fat bike adventures even further? With a supercharged, ultra efficient, first of its kind fat suspension fork called BLUTO. We started with the features you’ve come to love from RockShox: Rapid Recovery rebound, Fast Black aluminum upper tubes, the infinitely tunable Solo Air spring, stout 15mm Maxle Lite, remote or crown adjustable damper, and tapered steerer tube. Then, the chassis got the fat treatment by reengineering it to meet the unique needs of fat tires and wheels. Everything from crown, to arch, to axle has been optimized to tackle the increased torsional loads of its wide stance. With more traction and control than ever before, you’ll never be happier you went fat. | Photo by Adrian Marcoux | Find out more by visiting SRAM.com here, You all have been waiting - Here it is! Introducing the all new RS-1 | FULLY INTEGRATED. COMPLETELY OPTIMIZED.
Engineering the RS-1 enabled us to use a fully integrated approach, avoiding the need for unwanted material in the chassis. We completely reimagined the fork’s structure, blending the legs, crown and steerer tube in a carbon mainframe resulting in an unprecedented level of integration and material optimization. The fully integrated RS-1 carbon mainframe improves steering precision and stiffness – every single gram serving its intended purpose, and nothing more.  | Video by Mind Spark Cinema | Find out more by visiting SRAM.com at http://www.sram.com/rockshox/family/rs-1, When it came time to best our XC platform, it meant reevaluating every element that defines the most winning XC fork in world cup history. A ruthless approach to material optimization, an ultra efficient energy saving lockout and quite possibly the world’s lightest air spring – all designed to enable riders to find their next line. The outcome was something unexpected. A fork that ushers in a new-generation philosophy to XC rider efficiency, packaged in a chassis design never before seen by RockShox. RS-1 harnesses 25 years of creativity, refinement, and the courage to tackle the biggest engineering challenge of mountain bike suspension to date: the inverted chassis., If you’re Russell Finsterwald, and collecting your paycheck involves lining up alongside a hundred-or-so of the world’s fastest riders and pushing your heart to its rev-limiter for a couple hours, then pre-dawn wakeup calls and shredding a bit of asphalt—as long as there’s a dirt payoff—is part of the job description. 

If you’re Chris Dewar, however, and your living involves ensuring that peoples’ homes and businesses are properly wired to power their televisions and toaster ovens, then there’s really no reason to sip your coffee at anything but a leisurely pace—especially when the pool is set at just the perfect temperature. 

The meeting point was the mile-high mountain town of Idyllwild, California, which is only two-and-a-half-hour drive from downtown Los Angeles, yet feels a century or more removed from the hustle of the big city. Even rolling into Idyllwild after a morning of sitting poolside in Palm Springs (a good hour by car or a short few hours of pedaling at Russell Finsterwald pace), this quiet little place offers enough culture shock to be noticeable. 

Located in the San Jacinto Mountains, Idyllwild attracted the attention of prospectors and miners in the wake of the California Gold Rush. Ranchers drove cattle and sheep here. Its massive pine trees have seen some logging. But ever since roads and cars made travel to Idyllwild easy, it has been a retreat for artists, actors, musicians, campers, hikers—and mountain bikers. 

Ultimately, though, the modes by which Dewar and Finsty rolled into town and the area’s history had little to do with the mission: riding mountain bikes in the Southern California dirt. When they found their first section of singletrack, weekday job descriptions became irrelevant and the goal was to milk the day for every last minute of light. Because when the sun dipped below the mountains and into the Pacific, there was only one thing left to do…get back to the pool., Different dudes. Same agenda. At least sort of, anyway. Bring XC champ Russell Finsterwald and weekend-warrior champ Chris Dewar together to some posh digs in Palm Spring, California, and some stuff is going to happen. Late-morning shuttle or pre-dawn pedal, it doesn't really matter—although the dawn-patrol, uphill, asphalt commute to the Idyllwild trails deserves a nod—when two like-minded mountain bikers come to check out some exciting new trails, limits are pushed and some dirt is sure to fly. #everythingchages, Introducing - RockShox Monarch and Monarch Plus with DebonAir | It's ok to be soft. DebonAir is not ashamed to give way under the weakest push. In fact, it makes Monarch and Monarch Plus shocks plusher than ever, right from the start. It might seem a weakness, until you take DebonAir to the trail. The connection between your bike and the terrain will be seamless, as your DebonAir equipped shock absorbs every little hit without any harsh feeling on your body. A shock so soft, you can push way harder. #besoft | VIDEO by Mind Spark Cinema

DebonAir will be available as an option on Monarch RT3 and as the standard configuration on Monarch Plus RC3, and also as an air can upgrade for any MY14 Monarch/Monarch Plus and MY13 Monarch RT3. , Built For Charging - Initially developed for the worldwide acclaimed RockShox Pike, the Charger Damper™ found its way onto BlackBox athletes’ bikes during the 2013 season. Simply put, the consistency, traction and small bump sensitivity of the Charger Damper™ were an instant hit with all our riders, including overall World Cup Champion Steve Smith. #Builtforcharging | Video by Mind Spark Cinema , A LEGACY OF WINNING
For nearly two decades, BoXXer has been piloted to the top step of the podium at downhill World Cup races and freeride events more than any other fork. With such a legacy, it’s no doubt the new BoXXer has already proven itself with Steve Smith’s World Cup overall victory and Kyle Strait’s Rampage win in 2013. The new BoXXer features the new Charger Damper™, new air and coil spring systems, Rapid Recovery™ rebound, Fast Black stanchions and 27.5” options. And guess what: the lightest production downhill fork on the market is getting a whole lot lighter. #builtforcharging| Photo by Adrian Marcoux of Sam Blenkinsop comfortably shredding in his beautiful homeland of New Zealand., Desert Dreaming | RS-1 | Setting an inspirational tone as you prepare for your weekend adventures. #everythingchanges, null, The life of a professional cross-country rider allows precious little extra time to look around and soak up the surroundings. Even if you’ve got your priorities straight and make a daily effort to “stop and smell the roses,” the demands of the job all too often get in the way of pure off-road enjoyment. 

So, in the late-winter months—before the world becomes confined to anaerobic laps alongside a hundred or so fellow racers, and between course-marking tape that acts both as a pathway as well as a barrier to the cheers (and jeers) of spectators—it’s good to get away and remember the point of riding mountain bikes in the first place. 

Before the first flag dropped on the 2014 racing season, we invited Kate Courtney and Russell Finsterwald to join us in Palm Springs, California, for a bit of desert singletrack that was completely free of clocks, coaches and competitors. 

Basecamp was a mid-century modern masterpiece complete with a pool, grill, backyard fireplace and enough grass to set up our 10-dollar croquette set. Not wanting to subject our non-racer hours on Kate and Russell, however, we found them both rooms at Palm Springs’ legendary Ace Hotel—a design student’s dream and no doubt a welcome departure from the second-rate ski-town condos and run-down two-star hotels that are par for the course for a bike racer. 

And as much as we wanted to overwhelm them with good food and soft beds, we wanted to give them a ride to remember, so we chose the Palm Canyon Epic. 

The Palm Canyon Epic is a cross-country-rider’s downhill, a 6,000-foot descent that also calls for more than 2,000 feet of climbing over the course of nearly 30 miles. Without number plates, the XC stars were able to relax and enjoy the massive desert vistas and cactus-lined Southern California singletrack. 

It is, as they both agreed, about experiencing new places, new trails and different adventures, after all. That’s the reason they started riding in the first place—and it’s the reason they’re both lifelong mountain bikers.
