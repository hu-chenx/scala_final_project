“Who would have thought?”
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 25, 2014  
"That next to Fenway Park (home of our beloved Boston Red Sox) that there would be a 5 star sushi restaurant? The ballgame crowd had left and we were greeted warmly and seated immediately. Our friendly waiter promptly arrived and gave us great service all evening. I'm not a sushi exert, but my daughter, who I was with is - and she said it was excellent (I enjoyed it, too). The restaurant is very well appointed, including a very nice men's room! To top things off, a local beer brewing company was there doing a promotion and we won a nice prize! Definitely will recommend and come back!", Harpoon is here tomorrow between 6:30 and 8:30 sampling Harpoon IPA and UFO with free giveaways.

"We just ate at Basho and truly enjoyed the food. We love sushi and have eaten at many sushi restaurants in Boston and New York and this one rates pretty high. In addition to the sushi they have a Roboto grill where you can order small plates of grilled vegetables and meats/fish. You can also order tempera by the vegetable or fish so that you get exactly what you want. The deco and atmosphere was upscale and comfortable."
