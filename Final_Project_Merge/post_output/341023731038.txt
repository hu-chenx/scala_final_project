Seeing them live with a horn section! Here, Roger Miller explains: 

"On UNSOUND we utilized a horn section on both "ADD in Unison" and "That's What they Tell Me", with a single trumpet line in "This is Hi-Fi". I composed these parts, with Pete giving the general outline for his song, "That's What they Tell Me."

We will recreate this at the NYC and BOS shows with a sax/trumpet horn duo horn section. My brother Benjamin will be on sax, and it might be interesting to note that he was the sax player in DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, one of the earliest USA punk bands. DAM included Ron Ashton from the Stooges and Michael Davis from the MC5, and produced the recently passed away artist Mike Kelley. Ben may well play on a couple other songs as well.", Doomtree's Dessa hits The Sinclair next Sun Jan 13, with a stellar lineup of opening acts- Adeem (NH) and H.W. and DJ Emoh Betta (Boston).
