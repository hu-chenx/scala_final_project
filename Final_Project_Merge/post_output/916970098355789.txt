We hear it at least once/day: "You have the most BEAUTIFUL food truck we've ever seen!"  There's a very cool story about the design of our truck.  

     Captain Marden's Seafoods has been New England‚Äôs premiere seafood monger since 1945! It was begun by Master Mariner Captain Roy Wilfred Marden, in 1945 as a single retail store. His mission was simple‚Ä¶ offer the very best seafood in town. It has now grown to include a large wholesale operation, retail fish market, restaurant, and now a food truck!
     Two years ago Keith A. Marden, Jr. (Kim), Captain Roy‚Äôs grandson, identified a market that was going swimmingly throughout the country ‚Äì food trucks!  Through a series of focus groups, inquires, and interviews, ‚ÄúThe Cod Squad‚Äù was born, featuring a rendition of the original Captain‚Äôs ship, "The Killarney" on the port side!
     The Cod Squad practices what is commonly known as, ‚ÄúFarm to fork‚Äù ‚Äì or in our case ‚Äì ‚ÄúMarine to Mobile Cuisine!‚Äù This is a concept of purchasing locally caught fish, directly from the fleets in Boston and Gloucester. The term which was adapted from ‚Äúfarm to table‚Äù comes from the idea that with less time and fewer hands for the food to get from the ocean to the food truck, the fresher, more environmentally sensitive and community minded it is. We also use locally grown, organic produce for our haddock sandwiches, chowders and fresh salads.
     The Cod Squad provides the same fresh seafood, affectionately known as the ‚ÄúShreve Crump & Low of seafood‚Äù served by over 400 New England restaurants including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts Bistro du Midi Boston Area Four Gaslight Brasserie du Coin Craigie On Main  The Beehive and Beat H√¥tel Simply Fresh, Simply New England.

, Go Pub-lic with your St. Paddy's Day funfest at The Squealing Pig Boston! Why?

Boston magazine: 
With St. Pat‚Äôs on the horizon, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll find yourself in a pub sometime this month‚Äîand nothing pairs better with a pint than fish and chips. Sadly, these offerings are oily and underseasoned at many restaurants, but the Squealing Pig in Mission Hill cooks up a notable exception. The pub‚Äôs thick-cut cod fillets, which come from Hub purveyor Captain Marden‚Äôs Seafoods, are beer-battered and deep-fried to golden-brown perfection. The fish emerges shatteringly crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside. Served with handcut fries, zingy tartar sauce, and a simple cabbage slaw, it‚Äôll fill your belly without giving you a grease hangover. (Avoiding any other type of hangover, however, is up to you.) 134 Smith St., Boston, 617-566-6651, squealingpigboston.com., Thanks Maggie for a great shout out!, Well...we were setting sail for Harvard University today, until the generator belt broke :( Won't sea you til tomorrow on Stuart Street with Gifted girlie friends!, Did you know that The Cod Squad serves up ALWAYS FRESH lobsta salad rolls - served on griddled fresh Hazels Bakery rolls!

Find us there, Saturday - it's going to be a great day!, Fish will feed just before a low pressure system (storm) hits. The lower pressure is more comfortable to fish than high pressure. You could look at this as the high pressure and the pressure of water pushes more against the fishes body, meaning discomfort and maybe even a full belly feeling. Low pressure = less pressure against the fishes body, comfort and an empty feeling belly = fish will seek out food and are more willing to chase prey.

Based on the number of people offering positive feedback, I'm hoping being with us was worth your while too and that you will want to return for future events.
