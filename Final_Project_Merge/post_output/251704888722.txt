#CavsPelicans, What will it take to get a #CavsPelicans win tonight?

Find out in 5 KEYS: http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/features/five-keys-pelicans-160206, Heart Month has arrived, and our Q Spirit Squad wants YOU to keep the heart rate pumping all February long!
Learn 21 ways to EXERCISE YOUR HEART: http://cle.clinic/1QIU5cl via Cleveland Clinic.
 
We caught up with Squad Members Buzzy, Sara, and Roni about why it‚Äôs important to show your heart some TLC:
 
 
CAVS.COM: What has your education in exercise science and kinesiology taught you about the importance of being heart aware and protecting your health?
 
BUZZY:  I have learned an incredible amount about cardiovascular health throughout my 20 years of being an athlete combined with my college education and experience with clients and students. I think a lot of people forget that the heart is a muscle and in order for it to get stronger, you have to take care of it. Let's talk some physiology. The cardiorespiratory system is composed of the cardiovascular system and the respiratory system which work together to provide the body enough oxygen and nutrients. The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart, which is in charge of pumping blood throughout the entire body. Think about it. That's a lot of blood that needs to be pumped in just one contraction.
 
So the stronger the heart is, the more efficiently it can work. Our heart is the most important muscle in the body. When I‚Äôm running across the court and getting ready for a big trick, I know that my heart is strong enough to push the blood into my legs and give me the strength to do what I love. There‚Äôs oxygen in the blood and I rely on it to be at my best. My team is committed to giving our best every single time and every single game. We have the best fans in the league and they deserve an incredible show. 
 
To be my best, I need my heart to be strong and healthy. Take care of your heart and it will take care of you. 
 
 
CAVS.COM: How do you take precautions to protect yourself or take care of your health?
 
SARA:  Heart disease and stroke is the No. 1 killer in women, and as an African-American woman, the risks are even greater for me. I exercise several times a week to keep my cardiovascular system in top condition. When the basketball team is on the road, I watch the game on TV and I do little workouts during commercial breaks. It helps me feel part of the game and it helps my body and my heart stay strong.
 
I also pay close attention to my nutrition and I‚Äôm extra cautious with sodium since research shows that salt can lead to higher blood pressure, which can cause adverse health impacts including stroke. I want to be as healthy as I can be to avoid the risk of heart disease.
 
 
CAVS.COM: What advice do you have for someone that wants to try running, but doesn‚Äôt know where to start?
 
RONI:  My advice is don‚Äôt be scared. Lace up those sneakers, grab your headphones, and take that first step outside. I always say the first step is the hardest, but once you take it, you have nothing to be scared about anymore. Start easy, try a run-walk combo for 15-20 minutes. No reason to be embarrassed about having to walk a little bit, intervals are good! To keep from getting discouraged when starting something new, whether it be running, a new tumbling pass, or stunt, I remind myself it's okay to have off days. Not every run is going to be easy, but the fact that you're out there bettering your heart and self is awesome! You are still improving your health even if you didn‚Äôt run as fast or as far as you wanted. Stay positive folks. Positive thinking is good for your heart too!, The 2nd contest of our back-to-back tips tonight at 7:30PM at Quicken Loans Arena!

Our beatwriter Joe Gabriele sat down with Head Athletic Trainer Steve Spiro to discuss some pillow talk and why it‚Äôs so important for the team to find some Zzz‚Äôs ...

* * * * * * * * * * 
 
What‚Äôs the best way for guys to get the maximum amount of sleep or rest during a long road trip?
 
Steve Spiro: I think the best thing is making sure that the guys have the right routines down. There‚Äôs some things that we try, some guidelines that we give them, like what temperature to set the room ‚Äì around 68 degrees ‚Äì to make sure they close the blinds so that there‚Äôs no light coming in, making the room as dark as possible so it‚Äôs the right environment to get good rest and good recovery through their sleep. It‚Äôs the best way that the body‚Äôs going to recover. The other things that we try to do are to stick to routine as much as possible. Obviously, our shootaround times are specific: when we eat, bus times ‚Äì everything that we can to allow guys to set their plan. 
 
For these guys, is there a difference between rest and sleep?
 
Spiro: Sleep is the best mode of recovery ‚Äì it gives the whole system a rest: the brain, the heart, your central nervous system. If they can‚Äôt get to sleep ‚Äì (for a lot of different reasons) ‚Äì which these guys obviously have, from the stresses of playing and what their bodies go through, any time off their feet is good rest if they‚Äôre awake. But sleep is obviously what you want them to get as much of as possible when they‚Äôre not playing or practicing, especially on a long road trip like one that we‚Äôre on. 
 
Is bouncing around through different time zones a factor?
 
Spiro: It definitely can play a role and that can be difficult and everybody fights that -- especially when you‚Äôre gone for this long. You try to get adjusted to it, but in the beginning, say you‚Äôre going to the West Coast, it can be really difficult. It takes a few days for your body to get adjusted. You try to stay on schedule as much as you can and try to get back to what would be considered a normal cycle. 
 
When they return to Cleveland, do you have them completely shut it down for a while?
 
Spiro: Yeah, we‚Äôre going to get back from Houston at a pretty rough hour ‚Äì I think 3:30 a.m. ‚Äì and obviously coming off a back-to-back we‚Äôre going to have that next day off for guys to do it. But we‚Äôll give them a guideline of what time you should go to sleep and give them the best chance to get back on East Coast time. And then it‚Äôs time to get the guys ready for the next game., LeBron James always puts on a show at NBA All Star.

Coach Blatt: http://on.nba.com/1lUvLJG, The entire Cavaliers family is deeply saddened with the news of John "Hot Rod‚Äù Williams‚Äô passing. Hot Rod was, first and foremost, a great teammate, and also the kind of dependable person and player that made the Cavaliers organization proud during his almost decade-long time with the team. Hot Rod was the guy that willingly and pridefully drew the toughest defensive assignment. He was the kind of talented, unselfish and versatile player and person that earned the respect of everyone around him, including his teammates and opponents, and those who knew and worked with him off the court as well. In many respects, he was the humble embodiment and unsung hero of one of the most memorable and successful eras of Cavaliers basketball.

Hot Rod will be greatly missed and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.

Take a deeper look at our offseason additions in BY THE NUMBERS: on.nba.com/1H57Yv8, Although Breast Cancer Awareness Month comes to a close this week ‚Äì taking charge of reducing your risk of breast cancer is a life-long practice. 
 
We spoke with Cavs Sideline Reporter Allie Clifton to talk ‚ÄúBreast Practices‚Äù (learn MORE in this helpful Cleveland Clinic infographic : http://cle.clinic/1PNXatn) and how breast cancer has affected her life: 
 
"Given that breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and knowing how many lives that have been saved due to early detection, the importance of ‚Äústaying ahead‚Äù is a no-brainer for me. Having been affected already by so many loved ones losing their battles to SOME FORM of cancer, I make sure I am constantly staying on top of my appointments & taking all the necessary steps to staying as healthy as I can. Breast cancer has hit close to home for myself & my family. I have a cousin, Christy Clifton-Hoffman who was diagnosed with breast cancer and thankfully has beat it. She is a SURVIVOR. Her fight & passion to shed light on this devastating disease brings a better appreciation for me on life & my overall health as well. 
 
I know that cancer is something that often times cannot be 100% prevented. Either you are going to get it, or you‚Äôre not. I do my part in staying healthy, as I think having an overall great form of health leads to many other great things in life as well. Staying ahead of the game is always something I try to do, and always being aware of sensing if something is wrong. If I don‚Äôt feel right ‚Äì I won‚Äôt even think twice about it; no one knows my body better than myself! 
 
My advice is to treat your body as a temple & never underestimate the power of good health. As I mentioned above, you are the one that knows YOUR body the best. You know when you‚Äôre feeling great and when you are feeling ‚Äúnot so great‚Äù. Listen to what your body is telling you & understand the power of ‚Äústaying ahead‚Äù with things such as early detection, self-exams & simple awareness.", #CavsTV practice interviews ...

Do you understand the FATS in YOUR food? Cleveland Clinic has this easy infographic to sort it all out: http://cle.clinic/1AJMd6a 
  
Do you make any changes to their diet as we reach the postseason?
Terry Bell: No, not at this point. I haven‚Äôt changed anything. It‚Äôs pretty much going through as we‚Äôve done during the season. 
 
Is it important to stress ‚Äògood fats‚Äô in their diet? And what are good fats?
Bell: It‚Äôs avocados, it‚Äôs salmon. Things that have the good, healthier fats in them. I do a lot of salmon out here; we do a lot of salmon when they fly out on the plane. Salmon‚Äôs rich in omega-3‚Äôs, the good fats. It‚Äôs also a good fish for a lot of good vitamins and minerals. We just want them staying away from the fried foods, staying away from the sugar stuff. 
 
Do you ever let them cheat?
Bell: Sure we do! We‚Äôll do ‚Äòcheat days‚Äô in here from time to time. They‚Äôre allowed. These guys burn calories like it‚Äôs their job out there.  Actually, it is their job!  But they get excited when they see something different. I‚Äôll definitely do like a mac-n-cheese day or a fried chicken day from time to time. 
 
Do you try to cut out sugar completely?
Bell: Well, if you look at a lot of those different energy bars and stuff like that ‚Äì there‚Äôs sugar in those and some of the juices as well. So you can‚Äôt cut it out completely. But it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre putting candy and cookies out there every day. It‚Äôs a lot of healthier snacks. 
 
What‚Äôs on today‚Äôs menu?
Bell: Today, I did grilled asparagus, New England clam chowder. I did a turkey lasagna with spinach and then a chicken picata., SLAM into Tuesday with NBA TV‚Äôs Best of Phantom: LeBron James 2015 NBA Season.

What are the 5 KEYS to a win in Atlanta? 
Joe Gabriele has the ANSWER: http://on.nba.com/1FnPc35, As the Wine & Gold begin another round of intense physical play ‚Äì what can help keep an edge? Cavs Performance Specialist Derek Millender knows that routine, proper diet & rest are critical habits for continued success. Hear from him below!

Simple habits can make a healthy lifestyle easy, like these Cleveland Clinic 11 SIMPLE HABITS FOR BUSY PEOPLE: http://cle.clinic/1Lb6vpi
 
Cavs Performance Specialist Derek Millender on whether he does anything different to keep guys fresh in the postseason ‚Ä¶
 
‚ÄúOne big thing we try to do is keep everything as consistent for the guys as possible and try to anticipate guys‚Äô needs with the increased intensity of playoff games ‚Äì and especially the short turnaround games in the second round, playing every other day. So right now, typically we‚Äôre trying to keep guys on the same routine and encourage them to eat the recovery foods and get as much rest as possible. And we‚Äôre also monitoring what guys are doing on the floor even more ‚Äì make sure they‚Äôre not overdoing it.‚Äù 
 
Is it hard keeping guys in rhythm when the series has odd days off or long breaks between games? 
 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so fortunate that we have so many veteran guys that have been here and done it before. So, I‚Äôve been leaning on them a lot. You know, asking them: What do you guys normally do in this situation? And what can I do to help? So I just credit those guys with helping us along the way ‚Äì making sure they‚Äôre finely-tuned but also that they‚Äôre not doing too much. That‚Äôs the No. 1 concern ‚Äì keeping them fresh for the games.‚Äù, Share your Georgio's Oven Fresh Pizza photos before Sunday at 11:00AM for your chance to WIN #CavsHawks Game 4 tickets! #ALLinCLE, ‚ÄúNeither David Blatt nor TheBron nor any other member of the Cavaliers has any intention of taking the Hawks lightly.‚Äù

How will you remember this team? #ALLinCLE, One key to Matthew Dellavedova‚Äôs game is efficiency. Being smart with training is not only important to decrease wear and tear, but also helps to sustain good health for a rigorous basketball season.
Exercise IQ can go a long way ‚Äì which the Aussie knows is crucial for career success. Test YOUR exercise knowledge out HERE, via Cleveland Clinic: http://cle.clinic/1Kay70K  

Hear from the man himself below ‚Äì as he reflects on strategy, listening to his body, as how LBJ has made an impression on him: 

*********************************************
  
How do you feel after long season, off season ‚Ä¶.
No, I feel really good. I feel in really good shape and I think picking up full-court gets your conditioning going. A bit of both. Against different players there‚Äôs different strategies and different teams. But I think it‚Äôs been somewhat helpful in this series. 
 
How do you avoid breaking down ‚Ä¶
You just have to be smart with how much work you do on the court ‚Äì like the extra work. And just the biggest thing, I think, is being efficient. So don‚Äôt get out there and do crazy drills, running up and down. Just get exactly what you need and get off your feet. You‚Äôve got to listen to your body and be smart about it. The most important thing is to be fresh and ready to go on game night. So just doing a little bit less than you want to when you‚Äôre out there is probably a pretty good idea.

LeBron‚Äôs influence on you ‚Ä¶.
Just watching, learning. The stuff he works on. The biggest thing is probably how well he takes care of his body and the work he puts into that ‚Äì in the weight room, in recovery and things like that. To do what he‚Äôs done for 12 years and with that many minutes and responsibility every game and how many hits he takes. It‚Äôs impressive what he does to take care of his body. He‚Äôs always ready to play every night., Eastern Conference Finals: Here. We. Come. #ALLinCLE

Mike Miller has taken time to read with local children, and leading by example is his strategy: 
‚ÄúReading to kids is extremely important. Obviously, for kids, it means everything. It‚Äôs teaching, it‚Äôs reading. It‚Äôs all of that. Kids want to be sponges, but you have to allow them to be sponges, too. And so, for me, if you set the bar high ‚Äì kids will reach it. And if you set the bar low ‚Äì they‚Äôll reach that. So, you make sure that you set the bar high.‚Äù, Last night the squad closed out their Western Conference slate in style ‚Äì a 111-89 taming of the Grizzlies ‚Äì to make it 14-1 vs. the West since January 15th.

Get started with these four tips from Cleveland Clinic >> http://cle.clinic/1A4FdLg

Cavs Performance Specialist Derek Millender has seen how fitness challenges can discourage someone from keeping a steady routine, but states that getting a handle on habits early on is key to success:

‚ÄúI think bad habits can be developed over the years, either if you‚Äôve trained alone and not had proper guidance. Or maybe you‚Äôve been in a situation where you just didn‚Äôt have the best resources to get the best type of training that was specialized for you. So what we typically try to do is, first and foremost, talk to the athlete and try to figure out what‚Äôs been successful for them. And then we‚Äôll take them through our own battery of tests. And then we‚Äôll work in conjunction with what they‚Äôve done ‚Äì (which has obviously gotten them here and which has worked) ‚Äì and then we‚Äôll try to slowly introduce the things that we feel like can help enhance what they‚Äôre already doing well.‚Äù, #CavsHawks Shootaround...

What do Smith, Marion & Shumpert listen to in order to get going before a big game?

J.R. Smith
‚ÄúIf I had a request, it‚Äôd be anything by Jay-Z. I‚Äôll go with anything by Jay-Z, whatever mood I‚Äôm in.‚Äù

Shawn Marion
‚ÄúIt depends. I‚Äôm an old school guy, so I‚Äôm listening to some DMX, some Jadakiss, Twista, Outkast. Really, anything kinda old school. But I‚Äôll listen to some of the new stuff. Lately, we‚Äôve been listening to some new stuff‚Ä¶Fabolous, the new Drake, J. Cole. It‚Äôs just a matter of what you feel. You go on a whim; you go with what you feel. What‚Äôs in the player‚Äôs head, right into the arena.‚Äù
 
Iman Shumpert
‚ÄúI listen to Chicago artists. Xavier Holiday, Young Wolf, King Louie, Y.P. I know a lot of them. But part of the thrill in knowing them is they‚Äôre going to be talking about stuff that I went through. They talk about current stuff that maybe I‚Äôm not going through because I‚Äôm not in Chicago, but it just makes me feel at home ‚Äì and when I feel at home is when I play my best ball. Like Xavier and Y.P. will mellow me out a little bit, it‚Äôs a little more thought-provoking music. Make me calm down, just listen and bop my head. But Wolf and King Louie , they hype me up. It just depends on that day, that game. And sometimes, I just put it on ‚Äòshuffle.‚Äô‚Äù, J.R. Smith's transition to the Wine & Gold has been clicking on all cylinders ‚Äì but how did his journey to Cleveland begin?
