World Hearing Day is an annual event that aims to raise awareness and promote ear and hearing care across the world. According to the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), approximately 15 percent of Americans between the ages of 20 and 69 – or 26 million Americans – have hearing loss that may have been caused by exposure to noise at work or during recreational activities.

Recreational activities that can put you at risk for noise-induced hearing loss include target shooting and hunting, snowmobile riding, listening to music at high volume through earbuds or headphones, playing in a band and attending loud concerts. Harmful noises at home may come from sources that include lawnmowers, leaf blowers and woodworking tools.

If you are a hunter, music lover, or work in industry where you are exposed to damaging noise, UA’s Audiology and Speech Center can help. Hearing loss from sound that is too loud is 100 percent preventable. During the month of March, all of the products offered in the center to protect hearing will be discounted by 10 percent in celebration of World Hearing Day.

Contact the Audiology and Speech Center, located in Polsky Building 181, at ext. 6035 to schedule your appointment. Take this simple step to protect your hearing. Our clinic is open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Congratulations to Benjamin Hottensmith for his masterful performance of Strauss' Concerto for Horn No. 1 in Eb major with the Symphonic Band this evening.

The obituary will appear in this Wednesday’s Akron Beacon Journal. Hummel Funeral Home is handling the arrangements.

Anne Jorgensen is including the scholarship in the obituary that will appear in Wednesday’s Beacon Journal.

Here is a link to the scholarship description and criteria that were established when Mr. Jorgensen retired:

http://www.uakron.edu/development/funds/?id=8fe463d4-1cbb-4ed0-88d9-919a460c9932

The fund is not yet endowed at the minimum level of $10,000, but is close. Endowed scholarships generate approx. 4.5% of the endowment each year, so we are now urging donors to consider an endowment of at least $25,000 so that the scholarship funds generated can make a more significant impact. 

Cyndee Snider can be reached at cyndee@uakron.edu or 330-972-5196 to discuss this in more details, and/or to facilitate your generous gift. Gifts may also be made on-line at the link below. Simply click on the green box and be sure to designate “Robert Jorgensen Scholarship” where indicated.

MORE:  During his lecture, Flory will consider the role of the musicologist as reissue producer. He was approached by Universal Music Group to provide musicological assistance with a reissue of Marvin Gaye’s Trouble Man, an album closely related to a 1972 Blaxploitation film soundtrack composed by Gaye. The process of completing this work gave him a glimpse into the world of the modern reissue producer, a rarely-discussed agent responsible for creating historical documents of past releases for the modern marketplace.

LIGHT-UP LANTERN FESTIVAL IN UNIVERSITY PARK
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2012

The Light-UP Lantern Festival in University Park is now coordinating artists, performers, story-tellers, musicians, actors and other creative participants for the fourth annual Light-UP Lantern Festival: Caravan of Lights! 
This year's lantern festivities will take place Saturday, October 13, from 6-10 p.m. The Light-UP Lantern Festival seeks to help revitalize the University Park Neighborhood in Akron through art, entertainment, and collaborative projects. It is dedicated to highlighting the unique talents and achievements of the surrounding area and using those strengths to build a better, safer, and stronger sense of community.

If you would like to help create magic and wonder through your participation, contact festival volunteer Diana Watt at 330-606-1314 or dianadwatt@gmail.com by August 24 for more information and a Performers Application form.

LANTERN FESTIVAL BACKGROUND 

Throughout the year the Festival's network of artists and instructors have worked with local schools, libraries, businesses, and the university to create opportunities for anyone of any skill level to actively become engaged in this spectacular community event. Classes are offered in lantern making, puppetry, costume making, collaborative art projects, and installations. The results of these workshops culminate in a unique and extremely creative atmosphere  - with parade! - the night of the event.

Last year the Light-UP Lantern Festival drew a crowd of more than 2,000 attendees. Due to the overwhelming popularity and interest in this totally free and family friendly event, the Festival's footprint has been expanded to accommodate the growing audience. There will be three stage areas plus opportunities for "wandering" performers. The success of the event has gained the attention of neighboring communities, schools, and businesses.  This momentum is being carried forward in 2012 by reaching out to an even larger audience through more classes, advertising, social media, and printed materials., Check out our own James Marron and his guitar students from Canton City Schools in this Canton Repository article:

No jazz bad-mouthing here
by Anastasia Pantsios

When Akron guitarist Dave Hammer and Cleveland-area bassist Matt DeRubertis met in the University of Akron jazz program, they bonded over their common non-jazz musical interests.
"We didn't fall into the jazz idiom, so we were always jamming with each other," says DeRubertis. "I don't want to sound like a jazz badmouther though, because it's totally influenced our lives and made us the unique product we are."
That product is progressive rock/blues/jazz trio Dave Hammer's Power Supply. Since debuting about two years ago, it released last summer's album, Words, and will launch an EP, Aht Uh Yo Hed, Friday at 9 p.m. at the Northside Bar & Grille (111 North Main St., Akron). Cleveland's Herzog opens. Admission is $10, which includes a copy of the five-track CD or a download card.
While the band members, who also include drummer Chris Baker, are all full-time musicians with a variety of projects, DeRubertis says they plan to do more regional touring (they've already gigged around Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois) and release two more EPs in the next year.
"We have a ton more material to record," he says. "We've arranged the songs in categories that flow together well. One will be a dirty, nasty Delta blues-type thing. The other is more psychedelic, spacier, a little more energetic. We're working to destroy the stigma that a lot of rockers don't like jazz and don't like jazz musicians. We're hoping to erase that a bit more.", Summer workshops continue at the School of Music.  It's not too late to sign up!  For a complete list, click on this link:
