It portrays the majestic great white shark as a mindless killing machine. The way in which the movie classified the sharks as human killers ultimately provokes humans to think this is normal. Remembering what happened after ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù is a perfect example. If we were to fish sharks to extinction, being that the ocean supports more than three-fourths of our planet, it would cause wide starvation and possibly the end to the human race.

We ask that you remember the following: when we enter the ocean, we enter a world where creatures thrive in different and sometimes frightening ways. The great white shark is a magnificent creature. Instead, we should value them ‚Äì in fact we NEED to value them. More than 100 million sharks are killed every year by humans. What do we do?  We sensationalize the fear of them. Should it not be the other way around?

Sharks are already misunderstood. We must remember that movies like ‚ÄúSharknado‚Äù only allow us to carry on the stereotype of them being mindless, evil eating machines. Don‚Äôt perpetuate the stereotype. Educate yourself. As many of us know and understand, awareness is the first step., Don't forget - the next clue to our social media scavenger hunt will be posted tomorrow at 11AM!

"For a lobster to live this long and avoid lobster traps, nets, lobster pots ... he doesn't deserve a bib and butter." He took the lobster back to sea, releasing it in a secret location where he said it would be almost impossible for fishermen to drag their nets. MacKenzie received a send-off from a group of children chanting "Let Larry Live" and the lobster was given a salute from the Niantic River Bridge operator who sounded the lift bridge's siren as the boat carrying it headed to sea., Thanks to Drink Local.

On the same day, NOAA announced that it is likely that Great Whites are indeed an endagered species. The Great White Shark is also listed as Vulnerable to Extintion on the IUCN Red List. 
 
This is an important international issue. Little is known about great white populations and many scientists suggest their species is currently vulnerable and possibly on the road to extinction. Sign the petition here to stop the unprovoked killing of Great White Sharks: http://www.savegreatwhites.com/, Good morning, Facebook - here's a story to help get you through Hump Day!
It was May of 2004 when Bill Driver noticed a ball bouncing around Sandalwood Lake (Kansas) in a peculiar way. It turned out to be a flathead catfish that had tried  to swallow a toy basketball, which quickly became stuck in its  mouth. The fish was exhausted  from trying to dive, as the ball would always rush him back up to the surface. Driver finally had to cut the ball in  order to deflate it. The catfish went home hungry, but at least he went home ;), SO CUTE. Who doesn't love an animal with a sense of humor? Thanks, Cap'n!, Colossal Cupcakes sure is the best.

By 1970, Cleveland Metal Products Co. bought the Powerhouse and used it as a warehouse. In 1984, Flats Development Inc. bought the Powerhouse with plans to renovate and incorporate the structure into the Nautica Entertainment Complex. Just four years later, the renovated Powerhouse opened to the public. Now, in 2012, the Powerhouse has found another purpose. The new addition of the Aquarium highlights the revitalization of the city of Cleveland and the Flats. New restaurants, new constructions and new purposes for historical buildings‚Ä¶**sigh**‚Ä¶oh Cleveland, we sure do love you!

What some of you don't know is the actual history of the building. Here are just two key facts to remember the next time you come in for a visit (and we'll follow up with more, don't worry):
In 1892 Cleveland businessman Marcus Hanna commissioned architect John Richardson to design the Powerhouse to generate power for Hanna's streetcar company. By 1926, the Powerhouse was shut down and abandoned.

Keep in mind that individual aquariums stand where coal tunnels used to be, thousands of gallons of saltwater and freshwater now exist in a space that was once abandoned before it was saved. The next time you visit remember that the brick you are touching has been there for over 100 years, and say hello to Cleveland‚Äôs newest aquatic neighbors. There is a reason why the GCA was added to the historical Powerhouse, and the GCA family is proud of this as all Cleveland residents should be., Looking to make a splash at a Halloween bash?

- Some Atlantic shark populations have declined by up to 90% in the last 15 years due to over fishing and finning.
- Sets of fins can sell for more than $700/kg, with Hammerhead Shark fins among the most valuable by weight.
- Shark fins, exported to Asia for shark fin soup, are now among the most expensive seafood products in the world.
- Shark fins are tasteless, and contain high levels of toxic methyl-mercury.
- Shark fin soup is thought to be an aphrodisiac in some cultures. High levels of methyl-mercury are known to cause infertility.
- The legal limit for consumption of methyl-mercury, set by the EPA, is 0.1 microgram per kilogram of body weight. Studies have shown shark meat contains as much as 1,400 micrograms of methyl-mercury in one kilogram. A person weighing 155 lbs would therefore get 50 times the legal amount in one single portion of shark steak.
- Sharks' life history makes them vulnerable to exploitation ‚Äì for example, Basking Sharks take 15-20 years to mature, have a 2-3 year gestation period and produce only 4‚Äì6 pups.
- Effective conservation and management are hindered by meager insight into the biology, life history, distribution, migration and exploitation of most shark species.

Visit us for Shark Weekend - THIS WEEKEND - and learn more about shark conservation and the dangers of shark finning. Learn more about the event here: http://bit.ly/Peq4DL, Facebook Fans - Who's ready for some Tuesday Trivia?

The GCA is proud to host SHARKS! Draw the Line, a FREE event for the public. This event is designed to educate the public on shark finning, an act responsible for taking up to 2,500 sharks from our oceans every 30 minutes. Shark finning is the practice of removing a shark's fins at sea and then discarding the body overboard, usually with the shark still alive. 
Many people don't know that one third of open ocean sharks are threatened with extinction; that Hammerhead sharks have declined by 89% in North West and Western Central Atlantic since 1986; that Porbeagle and spiny dogfish sharks have been reduced by 90% in the Northwest Atlantic; that one third of European sharks are threatened with extinction; or that 14 species of Mediterranean sharks are critically endangered.
These statistics show that sharks, creatures that have been around for over 400 million years, are in serious trouble. The GCA is calling on YOU to participate in our first annual Shark Weekend coming up this Friday and Saturday from 10AM-4PM because we need your help, and so do the sharks.
Give sharks a fighting chance by clicking on our ‚ÄúTake Action Now‚Äù application shown above in the Application field.

The dusky shark swims in tropical and temperate oceans worldwide, cruising from depths of 1,300 feet near the continental shelf all the way in to the surf zone. Dusky sharks, also known as bronze or black whalers, are long-distance swimmers known for seasonal, temperature-driven migrations that males and females undertake in separate groups. Local patterns vary but the sharks often head toward the Poles in summer and return to the Equator in winter on sea voyages that have been known to top 2,000 nautical miles., Some morning humor for you, Facebook fans!, We have recently added a few new exhibits in our Coastal gallery one of them being cuttlefish. The cuttlefish has 8 arms, with two rows of suckers along each arm and two feeding tentacles. They are also known for their ability to change the color of their skin.

Shark Spotlight - The African Dwarf Sawshark

The African dwarf sawshark was one of four new sharks discovered in 2011; it was accidentally captured in a 1,600-foot-deep trawl off Mozambique. The animal is only the seventh species of sawshark known to science, according to David Ebert, a research associate. The predator has a long, tooth-studded snout that it uses like a sword, whipping the appendage through schools of fish and then returning to eat any casualties., Experts believe that the whale shark can live up to 150 years, making it one of the longest-living creatures on Earth. Sandy the shark paid tribute to Cleveland's West Side Market, honoring them for their 100 year anniversary. Let's make sure that all sharks live long and healthy lives! Shark Weekend is just 15 days away, and the GCA is proud to host SHARKS! Draw the line - a FREE event to the public. Click here for more information on how you can join in the fun: http://bit.ly/Peq4DL, We would've given him a 10., Educate yourself - worth the read., Shark Spotlight - The Sand Bar Shark
Like other shark species, this sandbar shark has electroreceptors, hundreds of specialized pores located on and around its head. This sensory system detects the electric fields all animals give off with every heartbeat or movement of a muscle. Sharks use this incredible ability to locate even buried prey, like stingrays on the seafloor. 
The GCA is home to four beautiful Sand Bar sharks! If you haven't seen them yet, come take a look!, Wait for it......, Mark your calendars! The GCA is proud to be a sponsor of the Burning River Fest, held on Saturday July 21 & Sunday July 22 at the historic Coast Guard Station on Whiskey Island.

Don‚Äôt be surprised if you see our very own Captain Neo walking the premises spreading good cheer and, of course, his knowledge of the Great Lake Erie!

For more information on The Burning River Fest and to purchase tickets please visit http://bit.ly/KxYiuI, Shark Spotlight: The Megalodon - "Megatooth"
Many believe that prehistoric megalodon sharks had the most powerful bite of any creature that has ever lived. Its bite was strong enough to crush an automobile and far exceeded that of the great white shark and even Tyrannosaurus rex. Known mostly from the large teeth it left behind, megalodon first appeared in Earth's seas about 16 million years ago and dined on giant prehistoric turtles and whales.
Who has taken a picture next to our Megalodon jaw replica?, Facebook friends: We've been doing a lot of talking about Shark Weekend and hosting SHARKS: Draw the Line, a free event for the public to participate in. This is why: Sharks are in a global decline, and their numbers have fallen by more than 80% in many cases. Knowing that the first sharks appeared in the world's oceans over 400 million years ago (more than 150 million years before the first dinosaurs), highlights the ecological mess we are finding ourselves in. A major threat contributing to the decline in shark population is shark finning, an act responsible for killing up to 2,500 sharks every 30 minutes. Shark finning is the practice of removing a shark's fins at sea and discarding the body overboard, usually with the shark still alive. Some people may ask why: the answer lies in the high value of shark fins. As an example, a single Whale Shark pectoral fin can sell for up to $15,000 US dollars. Although shark finning has been banned by many countries, the practice of finning continues due to poor monitoring and fishing regulations. Additionally, shark fin soup is considered a status symbol in such places as China and Japan. One bowl of shark fin soup can sell for as much as $100. The demand for shark fin soup is fast outpacing supply, and is driving the global depletion of shark populations. Everyone can help the sharks through their personal actions and purchase decisions. This is why we are calling on YOU, because we need your help and so do the sharks. Be here on July 28th and 29th to learn more about shark finning and shark conservation. Volunteers will use plywood templates to draw silhouettes of various shark species, ranging from about 3 feet to 6 feet in length. The collection of silhouettes on pavement will make clear the epic ecological loss taking place with each passing hour. There will be additional activities going on, outdoor entertainment, and both a local and international petition for you to sign that will be sent out in hopes of providing better protection for all sharks and their ocean ecosystem., Day 4: Sandy visits the Free Stamp!

**This event is FREE to all GCA pass holders**, Shark Spotlight: Hammerhead shark
Hammerhead sharks are predators that use their unusually shaped heads to improve their ability to find prey. Their wide-set eyes give them a better visual range than most other sharks. By spreading their highly specialized sensory organs over their wide, mallet-shaped head, they can more thoroughly scan the ocean for food. The great hammerhead is the largest of the nine identified species of this shark. It can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 1,000 pounds., Honoring the Alaska Sealife Center for all of their efforts in attempting to save the baby Beluga.

Nurse sharks are slow-moving bottom-dwellers and are, for the most part, harmless to humans. However, they can be huge, up to 14 feet, and have very strong jaws filled with thousands of tiny, serrated teeth. Nurse sharks are nocturnal and will often rest on the sea floor during the day in groups of up to 40 sharks, sometimes piled on top of each other., Sandy the shark, one of the Aquarium's mascots, will be out and about taking pictures at some of Cleveland‚Äôs most well-known places.  Today, we have a picture of Sandy at the Natural History Museum with her arm around Steggie.

She doesn't bite., Good news shark lovers! A step in the right direction to say the least., Shark Spotlight - The Great White
Getting to know sharks as predators: Great whites are the largest predatory fish on Earth. They grow to an average of 15 feet in length, though specimens exceeding 20 feet and weighing up to 5,000 pounds have been recorded. Their mouths are lined with up to 300 serrated, triangular teeth arranged in several rows, and they have an exceptional sense of smell to detect prey. Their main prey items include sea lions, seals, small toothed whales, and even sea turtles and carrion., We have added new species to our Coastal gallery, one of them is the Wunderpus.  The wunderpus is a long-armed species that occurs in muddy habitats in the shallow waters in Indo-Malayan waters.  It is characterized by small eyes on elongated stalks.

Congrats!, We take pride in knowing that the Greater Cleveland Aquarium is a family attraction, and we do understand that strollers are an important part of family travel.  So why would be ban strollers and wagons from our building? Simply, the design of the FirstEnergy Powerhouse is unique and does not allow for strollers and wagons with the initial large crowds at opening, and allowing them would cause safety concerns.  Our top priority is visitor safety, and we also want to make sure visitors enjoy their experience at the GCA.  We will be revisiting this policy after our opening, thank you for your support!, Parking Prices for the Greater Cleveland Aquarium will be $3.00 M-F and $5.00 Sat-Sun., Happy New Year! Less than 3 weeks until we open our doors...great way to start 2012!)
