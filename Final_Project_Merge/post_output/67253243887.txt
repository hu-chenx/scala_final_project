At the end we should have scored a second goal, but most importantly we finished with a clean sheet. The result puts us in a good initial position for the second leg! #packmas, Players like Johann Cruyff, Uli Hoeneß, Franz Beckenbauer or Eusébio shaped the European Champion’s Cup in the 70's and 80's. It was them who turned the competition into the supreme dimension of football. Today we’re wearing FC Bayern Munich’s jersey and by living the „mia san mia“ we're responsible for our club’s victories in the UEFA Champions League. #packmas, Tonight we’ll face Lisbon, the league leader from Portugal.

And we’re having fun, even without Thomas Müller 😉, Eine sehr, sehr wichtige Woche geht für den FC Bayern Munich zu Ende. Am Mittwoch war es für uns ein langes und hartes Spiel gegen Juventus Turin und heute Abend war der Sieg in Köln wichtig für unser Ziel in der Bundesliga. 
Eine wichtige Entscheidung war die Verlängerung mit David Alaba, weil es eine Entscheidung für Kontinuität und höchste Qualität ist., After this thrilling game against Juventus we want to make use of the positive energy and score a victory in Cologne today! #packmas, And still, what a great evening: the whole team did an amazing job. And thanks to the crowd for your overwhelming support! Quarterfinal, here we come!! #MiaSanMia, Today’s the day!

116 years of FC Bayern and an important win against a strong opponent. Right on time! 

#MiaSanMia, What a historic game it was last year when Robert Lewandowski scored five goals in nine minutes. Today, we want to extend our away record! #packmas, With both kickoffs yesterday and today night the Merkur CUP  solemnly starts into another round. 400 teams are participating in the world’s biggest competition for young soccer players (8-10yrs of age). On the way to the finale not only goals and athletic performances are important, but also values like tolerance and responsibility, respect and humbleness as well as acceptance and justice - all of them forming a huge priority. Thus I’m really happy to be patron of Merkur CUP this year, too. Wishing all young sportsmen success, fun and many exciting - but most importantly - fair games., Really good game of both teams - we’re satisfied with the result considering the strong opponent. To make it to the quarterfinal of the UEFA Champions League we’ll appear self-confident in the home match. #MiaSanMia #JuveFCB, If I won’t score a goal tonight I’ll be a record holder - 100 UEFA Champions League games without goals. 😉

Find a more serious discussion concerning today’s game in my column:, Darmstadt is one of the best away teams of the league. As a recently promoted team this is a great achievement. Our senses are sharpened - but most importantly, after three away games in a row, we’re looking forward to playing at home again! #packmas, null, null, The injury of Holger Badstuber affected us all to the core. Holger, we know that you’re a fighter and that you’ll be back on the field soon. 

The current situation isn’t easy, our trainers successfully prepared us for the game against Augsburg though. Even without a regular central defender the defense did a very good job. We’re really happy with this win. #GetWellSoonHolger #MiaSanMia, Augsburg's performances on the field are disciplined and the team operates out of a structured defense. They are an unpleasant opponent, which we had to experience in the home game. Still we’ll give it our best to leave the field with three points. #packmas, The match against Bochum wasn’t easy. Many thanks for the amazing support! We are looking forward to the cup’s semifinal home game against Bremen and will continue working hard. #MiaSanMia, Bochum has started well into the second half of the season in the 2nd division and faces all chances of climbing up. We are aware of their strength, but also looking forward to this cup match’s challenge. #packmas #BOCFCB, Wishing everyone a great start into Chinese New Year of the Monkey. What do you think of my pronunciation at the end?, Not an easy task, as our opponent has a strong offense. But we're prepared the best way possible and highly motivated! #packmas #B04FCB, Fully focused on the top match against Leverkusen on Saturday! #B04FCB, It was a successful kickoff in the first home game this year. We've played confidently and won well-deserved. Special thanks to the fans for your support. #FCBTSG

So feel free so send me your photos, graphics and paintings by using #LahmFanFoto - can’t wait to see them 😉, First, I’d like to make clear: all three nominees are outstanding soccer players and Leo Messi is a well deserved winner of the Ballon d’Or. But from my perspective soccer is more than just scoring goals. Read here why I think the procedure of this event isn’t fair., We've trained very focussed the last couple of days. There's a good atmosphere within the team, everyone is looking forward to the second half of the season., Congratulations, Manuel Neuer! After great achievements for FC Bayern Munich as well as for the national team it’s more than deserved you were selected World Goalkeeper of the Year again., Im Trainingslager in Doha herrschen sehr gute Bedingungen, um sich für die anstehenden Herausforderungen in Liga, Pokal und Königsklasse optimal vorzubereiten. Wir freuen uns darauf!, It was very restful spending some time with the family. With today's training session at FC Bayern Munich we're in preparation for the second half of the season. And congrats to Douglas Costa on being voted best player of the first half of the season!, I wish you a happy and successful year 2016!, In part two of my end-of-year review the summer camp is near and dear to me. It made me even happier to see how much fun the kids had at the camps!

While being on summer break we travelled to China with FC Bayern Munich. As we had several test matches in a few days it was an exhausting trip. On the other hand it was amazing meeting all these wonderful people. Surely we’ll be visiting soon again.

And at my South African foundation project we were able to kick-off the construction of the Philipp Lahm Sports Ground., At the end of the year it’s time to recall the past 12 months. Today and tomorrow I’d like to show you my highlights - as for the most of you, 2015 has been an an eventful year for me.

Being voted into FIFA/FIFPro World XI-World Selection 2014, I was allowed to receive an award in January.

The ISPO - a sports exhibition - was the starting shot for the cooperation with Sixtus in spring.

And in May 2015 we were able to celebrate the 25th German Championships. At this point I’d like to thank Bastian Schweinsteiger once more for all the great times we had together., Let’s check out the best of your #LahmFanFoto one last time this year. Thank you very much for your effort, your creativity is incredible!, Thank you so much for your support throughout this year. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all of you., Merry Christmas and my best wishes to Bastian Schweinsteiger., Viele Weihnachtsgrüße nach England, lieber Bastian Schweinsteiger!, Von Frau Reindl persönlich empfohlen, gibt es im Sixtus Adventskalender Duschgels zu gewinnen :-), Yesterday all Christmas letters have been sent to donors of the Philipp Lahm foundation. I’d like to take this opportunity and thank everyone for their support. 

It’s because of you a variety of projects have been put into action: the Philipp Lahm summer camp took place three times this summer, about 250 kids participated. I got the chance to visit each camp and it made me happy seeing the kids having fun. Several coaches of the project Shongi Soccer in Johannesburg (South Africa) completed the official SAFA-trainer certificate successfully. This is great, especially for the teams. And I was able to report about the first turn of the sod for the Philipp Lahm sports ground in Philippi. I’m looking forward to the start of construction there next year., Because of Xabi Alonso and his stunning goal we made it to the next round of the Cup and brought our last home game to a positive end. In this way we’d like to thank our fans for the amazing support! #MiaSanMia, As seen on Saturday, promoted teams can be very difficult to play. Therefore we’ll have to be attentive - especially as only these 90 minutes count! #packmas, Ingolstadt hat uns alles abverlangt - aber wir sind froh über den Sieg und freuen uns die Herbstmeisterschaft mit unseren Fans zuhause zu feiern! Und das Toreschießen fühlt sich immer noch ganz gut an 😉 #MiaSanMia

Ingolstadt stretched us to the limit - but we're glad about the result and happy to celebrate being on top of the table at Christmas with our fans! And scoring still feels pretty good 😉, Nach dem heutigen Training war es mal wieder Zeit für eure Bilder. Hoffentlicht macht euch die Aktion genauso viel Spaß wie mir. 😊 #LahmFanFoto

After today's training it was time for your pictures again. Hopefully you are enjoying this campaign as much as I do. 😊 #LahmFanFoto, Zum ersten Mal geht’s für den FC Bayern Munich ins Maksimir-Stadion nach Zagreb. Dort erwartet uns heute mit Dinamo keine leichte Aufgabe. Obwohl wir bereits für das Achtelfinale qualifiziert sind, möchten wir die Gruppenphase aber unbedingt mit einem Sieg abschließen. #packmas

For FC Bayern it’s the first time playing at the Maksimir studium in Zagreb. Dinamo won’t be an easy challenge tonight. Despite being already qualified for the round of 16, we want to finish the group stage with a win. #UCL, Mit Borussia Mönchengladbach sind wir heute auf einen hoch motivierten Gegner getroffen, der unser Spiel früh gestört hat. In der ersten Halbzeit waren wir dominanter, haben unsere guten Möglichkeiten allerdings nicht genutzt. Diese fehlende Konsequenz nutzen die Gladbacher in den zweiten 45 Minuten aus und entschieden das Spiel mit 3 Treffern in 14 Minuten für sich.

Today we faced Borussia Mönchengladbach, a highly motivated opponent, that tried to tackle us at a very early stage. We have been more dominant in the first half, but we didn’t use our chances well. Gladbach made use of our lack of consistency in the second half and scored three goals within 14 minutes., null, Die FCB-Legende wusste eben schon früher, was gut ist 😉

The FC Bayern Munich legend always knew what's good 😉, Radio Müller sendet auch während des Trainings. 😃

Radio host Thomas Müller live from training today. 😃, Fußball ist Sport, Beruf, Event, Organisation und Leidenschaft. Daher freue ich mich ab heute einmal im Monat meine Erinnerungen, Erfahrungen und Gedanken zum nationalen und internationalen Fußballgeschehen auf Goal.com zu teilen und mit euch zu diskutieren. Thema der ersten Kolumne: Das Spiel ist größer als das Feld.

Football is sport, profession, organization and passion. That’s why I’m happy to share my memories, experiences and thoughts on national and international football events with you on Goal.com once a month. Exchanging views on football with you is also something I’m looking forward to. Here's the link to the English version: bit.ly/GoalcomColumn1, Obwohl wir vielleicht etwas ernst schauen - das gestrige Fotoshooting mit Andrea Pirlo und Kuba Błaszczykowski hat viel Spaß gemacht. 

Although we might put on a serious look - we all had a lot of fun at yesterday’s shooting., Aus dem Projekt Shongi Soccer bei Johannesburg habe ich dieses Video erhalten. Ich freue mich, dass wir mit dem Bau des Fußballplatzes 2008 den Kindern und Jugendlichen aus dem Township einen Ort zum Fußballspielen ermöglichen konnten. Und das regelmäßige Training mit unseren Shongi Coaches zahlt sich schon aus - die Jungs spielen super! 😉

I received this video from the Shongi Soccer project in South Africa. Glad we were able to build a sports area there in 2008 so the kids can play soccer every day. And the consistent training seems to pay off - the boys are playing very well! 😉, Mit Hertha BSC erwartet uns heute eine taktisch disziplinierte Mannschaft mit einer hohen Laufbereitschaft, die nicht umsonst auf dem vierten Tabellenplatz steht. Aber wir wissen um die eigenen Stärken und wollen unseren Lauf in der Allianz Arena fortsetzen. #packmas

Today’s opponent is ranked fourth and very strong when it comes to tactics with a high willingness to run. But we’re very well aware of our strengths and want to continue our good run at home., Auch zu meinem Geburtstag gab es von euch viele coole Bilder. Auf diesem Weg noch mal besten Dank dafür - ebenso für alle weiteren Bilder unter #LahmFanFoto.

As part of my birthday you uploaded lots of pictures using #LahmFanFoto also. This is amazing, thank you so much!, Im heutigen Heimspiel wollen wir gegen die auswärtsstarken Griechen den vorzeitigen Gruppensieg in der Champions League perfekt machen. #packmas

Danke an Jan Frodeno für die Demonstration., Es war keine einfache Trainingswoche beim FC Bayern Munich. Dennoch haben wir uns bestmöglich auf den heutigen Gegner vorbereitet und wollen auf Schalke eine gute Leistung abliefern.

It hasn’t been an easy week of training. Nevertheless we prepared the best way possible and want to perform well against Schalke this afternoon., Training beim FC Bayern Munich mit Fokus auf Schalke am Samstag.

Training session at FC Bayern with a focus on Schalke on Saturday., Auch unser heutiges Training beim FC Bayern Munich war noch überschattet von den tragischen Ereignissen Ende letzter Woche. Wir sind nach wie vor alle geschockt und erschüttert. Es entzieht sich meiner Vorstellungskraft, wie Menschen einander so etwas antun können. 

Am kommenden Wochenende geht es für uns trotzdem in der Bundesliga weiter. Was wir aus meiner Sicht jetzt nicht zulassen dürfen, ist, dass die Angst unser tägliches Leben bestimmt. Wir müssen darauf vertrauen, dass Politik und Sicherheitsbehörden weiterhin die richtigen Maßnahmen treffen - auch bei Großveranstaltungen - und den Blick nach vorn richten.

Und das bedeutet für uns ganz konkret, so schwierig und gleichzeitig profan es im Moment erscheinen mag, sich auf das nächste Training, das nächste Spiel und die Meisterschaft zu konzentrieren.

Today’s training session at FC Bayern was overshadowed by last week’s tragedy, as we are all still in shock. It is beyond my imagination how people can commit such violence on others. 

Nevertheless we will play in Bundesliga next weekend. I believe we should not let fear affect our everyday life. We have to trust our political leaders and security services to take the right measures and carry on looking ahead. 

As tough and profane as it may sound, for us, this means to continue to concentrate on training, the next games, and the championships., Durch unser Stiftungsteam ist letzte Woche mit dem ersten Spatenstich der Startschuss für den Bau des neuen „Philipp Lahm Football Ground“ im südafrikanischen Township Philippi gefallen. Das Bauvorhaben für den Sportplatz hatte sich leider immer wieder verzögert. Umso glücklicher bin ich, dass Kinder aus dem Fußballverein von iThemba Labantu - Lutheran Community Centre bald auf ihrem eigenen Platz trainieren können.

With a symbolic turn of the sod our foundation team kicked-off the construction of the new „Philipp Lahm Football Ground“ in the South African Township Philippi. Unfortunately the building project for the sports area was delayed over and over again. Therefore I am all the happier knowing the kids from the civic center of iThemba Labantu will be able to train on their own field soon., Einfach unglaublich, wie viele Nachrichten mich heute über die verschiedensten Wege erreicht haben. Vielen Dank für eure Glückwünsche, ich habe mich sehr darüber gefreut!

The amount of messages that have reached me today is simply unbelievable. Thank you so much for your kind wishes - you made this day special., Danke, liebes Sixtus-Team! Aus der Kuchen-Nummer komm ich wohl nicht mehr raus ;-)

Many thanks, #Sixtus! I guess I have to bake a cake for you now ;-), Vielen Dank für die leckere Überraschung, Männer! Euer Kuchen kann sich wirklich sehen lassen. Das mit dem Singen üben wir aber noch mal 😀

Thanks for this delicious surprise, guys! Your cake looks fantastic. But next time, let’s give it another try when it comes to singing 😀, In der Länderspielpause habe ich mal wieder Zeit, mich mit Themen abseits des Fußballplatzes zu beschäftigen. So hat sich bei Sixtus in den letzten Wochen viel getan. Ich freue mich, wenn ihr einen Blick in die „Sixtus Sport News“ werft. Darin geht es um unsere neue Sport-Linie, die Olympischen Spiele und Scottie Pippen: http://bit.ly/SixtusMagazin 😉

The international break gives me time to get in touch with topics apart from soccer. In the recent past a lot of interesting things have happened at #Sixtus. Take a look at the new magazine called "Sixtus Sport News“. It's about our new sport line, the Olympic Games and Scotti Pippen 😉, Tolle Stimmung beim Paulaner Cup in Regensburg. Es hat richtig Spaß gemacht, gegen die internationale Fan-Auswahl und damit einen so motivierten Gegner zu spielen 😀

A special atmosphere at the Paulaner Cup in Regensburg. It was great fun playing against an international selection of talented players. They were highly motivated 😀, Die Vielfalt und Kreativität eurer #LahmFanFoto's sind großartig. Es macht einfach Spaß, sich durch die Bilder zu klicken. Vielen Dank für euren Einsatz!

The variety and creativity of your #LahmFanFoto’s are simply amazing. Clicking through them is so much fun. Thanks for your effort!, Im heutigen Spiel in der UEFA Champions League werden wir alles daran setzen, das Ergebnis aus London zu korrigieren. Optimal vorbereitet und mit der Unterstützung unserer Fans, wird uns das auch gelingen. #packmas

In today's Champions League match we will give it our best to perform better than we did in London. Well prepared and with the support of our fans I'm convinced we'll succeed. #UCL, Mit Ball am Fuß im Strafraum versetzte er die gegnerische Abwehr stets in erhöhte Alarmbereitschaft - und trotzdem gelang ihm in den meisten Fällen ein Treffer. Die Anzahl seiner Tore und Titel sind für die Ewigkeit und passen zusammengenommen in keine Vitrine. Seine Leistungen für Verein und Nationalmannschaft haben den FC Bayern Munich und das ganze Land stark geprägt. Er zählt zu den großen Persönlichkeiten der deutschen Fußballgeschichte und ist - auch aufgrund seines bescheidenen Charakters - ein Vorbild für jeden von uns. Alles erdenklich Gute zum 70. Geburtstag, Gerd Müller.

With the ball stuck to his feet he always put the defense on the alert - and still managed to score in the end. The amount of goals and titles will probably remain unrivaled forever. His performances for FC Bayern and the DFB team have strongly influenced the club and the entire nation. He is one of the greatest personalities in the history of German soccer - his modest character makes him a role model to all of us. All the best to your 70th birthday, Gerd Müller., Im diesjährigen Sommercamp habe ich Elke Reichart wiedergetroffen. Die Autorin hat vor Kurzem ihr neues Buch „Was heißt hier Respekt?!“ veröffentlicht - mit 12 Ansichten von verschiedenen Personen und deren Geschichten, darunter meine.

Als Teil der Erziehung ist mir Respekt besonders wichtig, denn jeder sehnt sich danach: ob in der Familie, mit Freunden, im Berufsleben oder in Alltagssituationen mit Unbekannten. Respekt heißt für mich im Privatleben offen auf andere Menschen zugehen, deren Meinungen anhören und akzeptieren. Im Beruf verstehe ich darunter hauptsächlich Regeln zu beachten - gegenüber dem Verein, den Mitspielern, dem Trainer, dem Gegner und auch dem Schiedsrichter. Die Wertschätzung muss man sich auf dem Platz durch konzentrierte und faire Leistungen erkämpfen und daneben erarbeiten. Dazu zählt auch mal, die Bälle nach dem Training zusammenzusammeln. Zu meiner Anfangszeit war es für mich immer etwas Besonderes, überhaupt dabei zu sein. Diese Einstellung müssen sich junge Spieler auf dem Weg zu einer erfolgreichen Karriere aus meiner Sicht bewahren.

At this year’s summer camp it was nice to meet Elke Reichart again. She just published her new book called „Was heißt hier Respekt?!“ with 12 views of different people on the topic „respect“ - including mine.

As part of parenting, respect is very important to me because everyone seeks for it: whether in the family, with friends, in working life or in any everyday situation with strangers. In privat life, to me respect means being open minded towards others, listening to their opinions and accept these. In business I consider it as following the rules - in relation to the club, teammates, coach, the opponent and the referee. Appreciation on court is won by focused and fair performances and acquired off-court. Sometimes this includes collecting balls after practice. In my early days it always felt special being part of it at all. From my perspective, this is an attitude young players need to preserve on their way to a successful career., Trotz einer guten Leistung konnten wir uns gestern gegen einen sehr defensiven Gegner leider nicht belohnen. Es ist natürlich schade, dass unsere Serie in der Bundesliga gerissen ist. Aber wir werden weiter hart arbeiten und alles daran setzen einen neuen Lauf zu starten. Der Fokus liegt jetzt auf das Spiel gegen Arsenal am Mittwoch. Vielen Dank an die mitgereisten Fans für die erneut großartige Unterstützung! #MiaSanMia 

Despite a very good team performance we weren’t able to reward ourselves against an opponent with a strong defensive attitude. Obviously it’s sad that our series has ended. But we’ll keep working hard in order to set off a new run. The focus is on Arsenal already. Thank you very much for the fantastic fan support last night!, Ein Einblick in die Sixtus Produktionshalle zeigt mir: Wie beim Fußball, sind Vorbereitung, Kontrolle und eine perfektionierte Abstimmung das Geheimnis eines erfolgreichen Qualitätsprodukts.

An in-depth look into the industrial hall of Sixtus has shown me that just like in football, preparation, control and a perfect coordination are the secret of a successful quality product., Zweite Pokalrunde, auswärts gegen den amtierenden Pokalsieger aus Wolfsburg. Sicher keine leichte Aufgabe - aber wir sind hoch motiviert für diese Herausforderung. Mit dem Rückenwind aus der Liga bin ich überzeugt, dass wir eine gute Leistung abliefern und den Platz als Sieger verlassen werden. #MiaSanMia

Second round of the DFB Pokal: away game against the reigning champion Wolfsburg. Surely not an easy task, but we are highly motivated for this challenge. Let’s maintain the momentum and I’m confident we'll perform well tonight and leave the pitch as the winner., Am Wochenende durften wir als Verein den 1.000 Sieg in der Bundesliga feiern. Wie jedes andere Team auch, versuchen wir auf der Suche nach Erfolg alle Aspekte zu berücksichtigen. Und so lassen sich die in diesem Artikel beschriebenen Erfolgsmuster für Unternehmen aus meiner Erfahrung als Kapitän auf den Fußball übertragen. Für eine intakte Mannschaft ist es wichtig, die inneren Bilder der Teamkollegen positiv zu verändern. Das geschieht durch Ermutigung, aber auch durch Anerkennung und Wertschätzung. Damit meine ich zum Beispiel ein Lob für einen guten Pass oder eine starke Einzelaktion. Gleichzeitig erhöht es die Leistungsbereitschaft und verbessert die Stimmung in der Mannschaft. 

As a club we were able to celebrate the 1000th win in Bundesliga history on Saturday. In search of success we always try to consider every aspect - just like any other team. From my experience as a captain the success metrics named in this article are applicable to football. In order to be successful as a team it’s important to change the inner pictures of your colleagues for the better. This is realized through encouragement, but also through recognition and appreciation. For instance, you can praise your teammate for a great pass or an amazing solo run and shot. At the same time this increases the commitment and - as a result - improves the atmosphere within the team., Heute Nachmittag ist der 1. FC Köln bei uns zu Gast. Mit einem Dreier wollen wir die Tabellenführung weiter ausbauen, vor allem aber mit unseren Fans den 1000. Sieg in der Bundesliga feiern. #MiaSanMia

This afternoon we will be hosting Cologne. Based on a three-pointer we want to expand our position at the top of the league - but most importantly celebrate the 1000th win in Bundesliga with our fans., Es ist unglaublich, wie viel Mühe ihr euch gebt und mir jede Woche unter dem Hashtag #LahmFanFoto eure Bilder zusendet. Vielen Dank - ich freue mich jetzt schon auf eure neuen Fotos.

It’s great to see you sending in pictures by using the hashtag #LahmFanFoto. The effort you put into this is amazing. I'm already looking forward to the ones you’ll upload next., Erneut geht es für uns in der UEFA Champions League auf die Insel - diesmal wieder gegen Arsenal. Wir sind gewarnt, denn die Tabellensituation in der Gruppe ist kein Abbild ihrer aktuellen Spielstärke. Dass die Londoner unter Druck stehen, macht es für uns nicht leichter. Aber der Trainer hat uns gut eingestellt und wir wissen, was uns erwartet. Und ich freue mich, ehemalige Nationalmannschaftskollegen wiederzusehen.

This year’s Champions League season takes us on the island again - this time against Arsenal. We are very cautious as the group table doesn’t reflect their playing ability. The fact they are under pressure won't make it any easier for us. But the coach has prepared us well and we all know what to expect. Furthermore I am looking forward to seeing my former colleagues from the national team., Liebe Fans, auf Basis einer geschlossenen Mannschaftsleistung ist uns gestern in Bremen der neunte Bundesligasieg in Folge gelungen. Die Freude über den Rekord ist groß, einen Tag danach richtet sich unsere Konzentration aber wieder auf die Königsklasse. Kurz vor dem Abflug nach London möchte ich euch mitteilen, dass ihr mich ab sofort auch auf Twitter findet. Ich freue mich auf die Plattform und den Austausch interessanter Themen.  

Hier geht’s zu meinem Account:

Dear fans, based on a solid and compact team performance we managed to win our 9th Bundesliga match in a row. We're all happy about this record - but from now on we'll concentrate on Champions League again. Shortly before take-off towards London I'd like to take the opportunity and introduce you to my new account on Twitter. I'm looking forward to the platform and to exchange ideas on interesting topics.

Follow the link: https://twitter.com/philipplahm, Fast auf den Tag genau habe ich vor einem Jahr im Heimspiel gegen Werder Bremen meinen 200. Sieg und ersten Doppelpack in der Bundesliga gefeiert. Heute Nachmittag geht es erneut gegen den Nordclub. Wir sind gut vorbereitet, motiviert und freuen uns auf die Herausforderung im Weser-Stadion. Und mal schauen, ob es mein letzter Doppelpack war 😀 #MiaSanMia #packmas

It was almost exactly one year ago when I celebrated my 200th win as well as my first double score in the Bundesliga against Bremen. This afternoon we'll face Werder again. We're well prepared, motivated and looking forward to this challenge. And let's find out whether that has been my last double score 😀, Der Ball ist ganz schön am rollen. Selbst in Indien werden die Skills von Manpreet Singh auf Herz und Nieren geprüft. #SkillsforRio, Es freut mich, Sie mal an meinem Arbeitsplatz begrüßt zu haben. Vielen Dank für den Besuch und bis zum nächsten Mal 😉
 
After I had already been to Sixtus in Hausham, CEO Petra Reindl and co-partner Franz Kroha visited me at Allianz Arena after my last Bundesliga match. It was great talking about entrepreneurial topics, and of course soccer 😉, Am kommenden Montag findet der Festakt zur Stiftungsgründung des Wertebündnis Bayern statt. Das Bündnis unterstützt junge Menschen dabei, Werte für ihr eigenes Leben zu entdecken und das Wertebewusstsein zu stärken. Auf meinem bisherigen Weg hatte ich immer Unterstützer, die mich gefördert und gefordert haben. Das ist nicht selbstverständlich. Deshalb möchte ich meine Erfahrungen und Möglichkeiten nutzen, um jungen Menschen die Gelegenheit zu geben, die eigenen Stärken und Bedürfnisse zu entdecken, um ein selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen. Weil sich das Wertebündnis Bayern für dieselben Ziele einsetzt, ist die Philipp Lahm-Stiftung seit Beginn als Partner mit dabei.

Next Monday the ceremonial act of the charity foundation called „Wertebündnis Bayern“ takes place. This Bavarian alliance supports young people on discovering values for their lives. Throughout my road of life I  was surrounded by pople who have always supported and challenged me. And this isn’t something I take for granted. Therefore I want to use my experience of life and help young people discovering their own strength in order to live a self-determined life. As this Bavarian alliance stands up for the same goal, the Philipp-Lahm-Stiftung is involved as a partner., Ich habe definitiv so einen #Kleinschmecker zuhause ;-) Ihr auch?, An dieser Stelle möchte ich dem Germany Football Team - Die Mannschaft ganz herzlich zur EM-Qualifikation gratulieren. Wenngleich es einige Hürden zu überwinden gab, hat es die Mannschaft sehr gut gemacht. Die Quali ist harte Arbeit, insbesondere als Weltmeister. Nun bleiben mehrere Monate Vorbereitungszeit. Aus eigener Erfahrung kann ich sagen, dass das Trainingslager besonders wichtig sein wird, um Abläufe und Automatismen einzustudieren. Ich bin sicher, dass der Bundestrainer das Team gut einstellen wird und freue mich auf das Turnier - als Zuschauer und Fan 😉

I’d like to take the opportunity to congratulate the DFB team on qualifying for the EURO 2016 in France. Although some barriers had to be broken down, the team did very well. Qualifying is hard work, especially as a World Cup holder. There are several months left in order to prepare. From my own experience I know how important the training camp is in order to work on processes and automatism. I am sure the national coach will set up the team the best way possible. Therefore I am looking forward to the tournament - as a spectator and fan 😉, Ich bin immer wieder aufs Neue gespannt, was für tolle Fanbilder ihr unter dem Hashtag #LahmFanFoto einsendet. Vielen Dank an alle Teilnehmer!

I'm always curious to find out what fantastic pictures you are sending in by using the hashtag #LahmFanFoto. Thanks to all participants!, Sybille Schönberger nennt sich selbst die Pfannkuchen-Göttin, ich finde meine Wurftechnik kann sich aber auch sehen lassen! Zum Abschluss der AOK-„Nachmacherkampagne“ standen wir zwei Profiköche gemeinsam mit der Gewinnerfamilie des Fotowettbewerbs am Herd ;-), Apropos Sport und Medien: Gerne nehme ich mir immer wieder die Zeit für die FC Bayern Munich Medien, da die clubeigenen Kanäle immer wichtiger werden, um unsere Fans weltweit zu erreichen. Besonders Spaß macht ein solches Interview natürlich nach einem Saisonstart wie in diesem Jahr und dem starken Abschluss gegen den BVB vor der Länderspielwoche.

Apropos sports and media: I always like to take some time to talk to the FC Bayern media, as the club-owned channels become more and more important, in order to reach out to fans worldwide. Obviously it is even more fun to give an interview after this kind of start into the season as well as the game against Dortmund ahead of the international break., Die Länderspielpause und den trainingsfreien Tag habe ich heute für einen Ausflug nach Kitzbühel genutzt, um das Camp Beckenbauer zu besuchen. Unter dem Leitthema „Die Zukunft des Sports in einer digitalisierten Welt“ wird hier über die Herausforderungen an die Sportwelt diskutiert. Beeindruckend, was Franz Beckenbauer und sein Team da auf die Beine gestellt haben. Und das als Angehöriger einer Generation, die nicht unmittelbar mit digitalen Medien aufgewachsen ist, wozu ich mich selbst auch noch zähle 😉. Es war extrem spannend den Experten zuzuhören und sich über Sport, Medien und die Entwicklungen in diesem Bereich auszutauschen.

As there is no training I used my day off in order to visit Camp Beckenbauer in Kitzbühel today. „The future of sports in a digitized world“ is the leading theme under which a lot of discussions about the challenges in regard to sports take place. It is impressive to see what Franz Beckenbauer and his team have achieved here. Keep in mind he belongs to a generation that grew up without digital media, to which I count myself as well by the way 😉. I find it exciting to listen to the experts and exchange views on sports, media and the developments in these fields., Erster gegen Zweiten! Heute treffen wir im Topspiel der Bundesliga auf Borussia Dortmund, die bisher eine starke Saison gespielt haben. Wir sind auf einen hochmotivierten Gegner eingestellt und freuen uns auf ein spannendes Spiel!

First against second! Today we face Borussia Dortmund in the top game of the Bundesliga, who are playing a very good season so far. We are prepared for a highly motivated opponent and looking forward to an exciting match!, Heute vor 12 Jahren stand ich zum ersten Mal in der Champions League in der Startelf. Ein Tag im Sixtus-Büro ist auch mal eine schöne Abwechslung und ich arbeite mich Stück für Stück in die unternehmerischen Themen ein. Wobei ich zugeben muss, dass ich einen kompletten Büro-Tag noch nicht vorweisen kann ;-) 

Today, 12 years ago I played my first UEFA Champions League match from the beginning. However, a day at the Sixtus office is a nice variation. I am making my way through the corporate topics of work. But I have to admit that I haven't spent a whole day at the office yet ;-), Heute vor 12 Jahres stand ich das erste Mal von Beginn an in der Champions League auf dem Platz – und das gleich gegen Manchester United. Damals noch im Trikot des VfB Stuttgart schenkte mir Felix Magath das Vertrauen. Dieses Spiel werde ich nie vergessen, zumal es 2:1 für uns ausging.

It was exactly 12 years ago when I made my first game in the Champions League from the beginning. Wearing the jersey of VfB Stuttgart we played Manchester United. I will never forget this moment - especially as we managed to win 2:1., Die Champions League-Bilanz von 8 Toren und 6 Punkten aus 2 Spielen zeigt, wie gut wir als Mannschaft funktionieren. Unseren gestrigen Gegner Dinamo Zagreb hatten wir von Beginn an im Griff und die Torchancen wurden konsequent genutzt. Deshalb freuen wir uns im Anschluss an eine kurze Trainingseinheit auf den heutigen Mannschaftsausflug zur Wiesn ;-)

2 wins, 6 points, 8 goals – this shows how good our performance in the UEFA Champions was so for. Yesterday in the match against Dinamo Zagreb we were right from the start in control of the match and consequently used our chances. That’s why we are even more excited to go to Oktoberfest with our team today after a quick training session ;-), Endlich wieder Königsklasse vor heimischem Publikum! Heute geht es im zweiten Gruppenspiel der UEFA Champions League gegen Dinamo Zagreb, die nach ihrem Sieg über Arsenal London hoch motiviert sein werden. Unser Ziel ist es trotzdem, die nächsten 3 Punkte zu holen und die Tabellenführung zu übernehmen.

Finally it's time again for the Champions League in front of our home crowd! Today we will face Dinamo Zagreb in our second match of the #UCL group stage. Zagreb will be highly motivated after their win against Arsenal London. Nevertheless our target is to get the next 3 points to be on top of the table., Aus meiner Erfahrung heraus kann ich bestätigen, dass Vertrauen und Verantwortung die wichtigsten Werte für Führungspersonen sind. Egal ob in einem Wirtschaftsunternehmen oder auf dem Fußballplatz, erfolgreich ist, wer das in die Arbeitsbeziehung auf allen Ebenen umsetzen kann.

From my experience I can confirm, that trust and responsibility are the most important values for leaders. Regardless of whether in a business enterprise or on the football field - those, who can implement these things at all levels of working relationships will be the ones to succeed., Als Kapitän, der so viele Einsätze hat wie kaum ein anderer Spieler in der Mannschaft, hast du eine besondere Verantwortung. Du musst immer konzentriert sein. Schließlich ist die eigene Leistung, die Konstanz der Leistung, die du in jedem Spiel ablieferst, die Grundlage für deinen Platz in der Hierarchie der Mannschaft. Nur sie verleiht dir die Autorität, deinen Mitspielern Anweisungen zu geben. Nur dann steht es dir zu, für die Mannschaft als Ganzes zu denken, zu sprechen und zu agieren.
 
As captain, who is playing as many matches as barely anyone else in the team you have a special responsibility. You have to be concentrated at all time. Lastly, it's your own performance, the consistency of your performance, you turn in every game, that sets the basis for your position in the hierarchy of the team. Only this gives you the authority to give instructions to your teammates. Only then, you are entitled to think, speak and act for the team as a whole., Well done Jamie Dwyer! #SkillsforRio, Was für ein unglaubliches Spiel gestern! Sowas habe ich noch nie erlebt. Robert Lewandowski hat gut gespielt. Schade, dass er aus seinen 7 Chancen nur 5 Tore macht. Da muss man schon kritisch sein. Spaß beiseite – herzlichen Glückwunsch für diesen historischen Auftritt, Robert. 😉

What an unbelievable game yesterday. I never experienced something like that. Robert Lewandowski played well. Unfortunately, he only made 5 goals out of his 7 chances. We have to be critical here. All joking apart – congratulations for this historic performance, Robert. 😉, 6. Spieltag! Schon heute geht es mit der nächsten großen Aufgabe in der Bundesliga weiter. Wir empfangen am Abend in der Allianz Arena den VfL Wolfsburg, der sich diese Saison bisher in Topform gezeigt hat und uns mit Sicherheit alles abverlangen wird. 

Matchday No. 6!  Today we face the next big challenge in the Bundesliga. This evening, we will play VfL Wolfsburg in the Allianz Arena, who have been performing very well recently and for sure will demand a lot from us., Glückwunsch noch einmal an die gesamte Mannschaft zum verdienten 3:0-Sieg gegen Darmstadt. Mit leicht rotierter Formation haben wir gegen stark verteidigende Gegner wenige Chancen zugelassen und gut gekämpft. Besonders freuen mich natürlich die beiden ersten Treffer von Arturo Vidal und Kingsley Coman. Morgen geht es schon mit der nächsten Herausforderung zuhause gegen Wolfsburg weiter.

Congratulations to the whole team on the 3:0 win against Darmstadt. With a slightly different formation we didn't allow many chances and fought very well. I'm particularly happy for Arturo Vidal and Kingsley Coman for scoring their first goals. Tomorrow we already face the next challange against Wolfsburg at home., Matchday! Ich freue mich auf ein spannendes Spiel gegen Aufsteiger Darmstadt, die sich in den letzten Jahren beeindruckend entwickelt haben.

Matchday! I am looking forward to an exciting match against Darmstadt, who developed impressively in recent years., Beim gestrigen Champions League Auftakt sind wir defensiv gut gestanden und haben Olympiakos Piräus kaum zu Konterchancen kommen lassen. Das war extrem wichtig gegen diesen defensiv eingestellten Gegner. Die Stimmung im Stadion war traumhaft, da spielt man gerne Fußball. Ich glaube, das hat man auch der Mannschaft angesehen. Schade, dass es im Vorfeld zu der unschönen Auseinandersetzung zwischen Fans und Polizei kam. Lasst uns im Rückspiel ein Vorbild für faires Verhalten sein und die Fans von Olympiakos in einer friedlichen Atmosphäre willkommen heißen.

At yesterday’s Champions League kick-off we had a solid defense against Olympiacos Piraeus. That’s why we didn’t leave much room for counter attacks, which was extremely important against an opponent with a strong defense. The atmosphere in the stadium was fantastic. We really enjoyed playing there and I think everybody could see that. Unfortunately, there was a dispute between the fans and the police. Let us be a role model in the second leg and welcome Olympiacos in a peaceful atmosphere., Ab heute startet auch die UEFA Champions League in die neue Saison. Unser erstes Gruppenspiel führt uns nach Griechenland. Im Auswärtsspiel gegen Olympiakos Piräus wollen wir den Grundstein für einen erfolgreichen Turnierverlauf legen.

The new season of the Champions League starts today. Our first group match takes us to Greece. Against Olympiacos Piraeus we aim to lay the foundation of a successful tournament., Heute fängt in Bayern die Schule wieder an. Auch die Kinder in Südafrika hatten Schulferien und die Mannschaften aus dem Philipp Lahm-Stiftungsprojekt „Shongi Soccer“ haben die freie Zeit genutzt, um an mehreren Fußballturnieren teilzunehmen. Die Shongi Mädchenmannschaft stand im Finale des „Mogale City Local Municipality ward tournament“ und ging mit einem großen Silberpokal nach Hause. Das erspielte Preisgeld wollen die Mädels in neue Fußballausrüstung investieren. Damit klappt es nächstes Jahr bestimmt auch mit dem ersten Platz 😉 Ich wünsche allen Schülerinnen und Schülern einen guten Start ins neue Schuljahr!

In Bavaria school starts again today. Also the kids in South Africa were on vacations and teams of the Philipp Lahm Charity project "Shongi Soccer" used their spare time to participate in various football tournaments. The Shongi girls' team made it to the final of the „Mogale City Local Municipality ward tournament“ and finished second. New football gear is what the girls want to invest their prize money in. With that I’m sure they will win the tournament next year 😉 I wish you all a great start into the new school year!, Letzte Woche habe ich zusammen mit der Gewinnerfamilie der AOK-„Nachmacherkampagne“ und Sybille Schönberger den Kochlöffel geschwungen. Botschafter sein, kann nicht nur richtig Spaß machen, sondern auch sehr gut schmecken ;-), Alles Gute zum Geburtstag, Thomas Müller!, Heute geht es vor heimischem Publikum im Derby gegen Augsburg.

In front of our home crowd we'll face Augsburg in today's derby. #MiaSanMia, Eine Legende wird 70. Alles Gute zum Geburtstag, Franz Beckenbauer!

A legend turns 70 today. Happy Birthday, Franz Beckenbauer. #Kaiser70, Ende August ging das letzte Philipp Lahm Sommercamp zu Ende. Seitdem haben mich einige Briefe von teilnehmenden Kindern und deren Eltern erreicht. Vielen Dank für eure Zusendungen und netten Worte. Es freut mich sehr, dass es euch gefallen hat!, Die Hockey-Jungs legen ganz schön vor. Auch Florian Fuchs
gibt schon mal Vollgas für #SkillsforRio :), Unter dem Hashtag #LahmFanFoto schickt ihr mir jede Woche eure Lieblings-Fanbilder. Ich bin noch immer von eurem Engagement begeistert, vielen Dank!

Every week you are sending in your favorite fan pictures by using #LahmFanFoto. Still I am delighted about your commitment. Thank you very much!, Auch bei solchem Wetter muss trainiert werden. 😉
 
You have to train in all weathers. 😉, Vielen Dank für eure zahlreichen Fragen. Auch wenn ich nicht alle beantworten konnte, hoffe ich, dass ihr interessante Details mitgenommen habt ;-)

Thank you very much for all your questions. I was not able to answer all of them, but I hope I could give you many interesting insights., Liebe Fans, 
morgen Nachmittag werde ich eure Fragen beantworten. Stellt sie mir einfach jetzt unten in den Kommentaren mit dem Hashtag #AskPhilipp. Ich freue mich drauf!

Dear fans, 
I am going to answer your questions tomorrow afternoon. Simply comment this post by using the hashtag #AskPhilipp. Looking forward to it., Heute Abend treffen wir in der Allianz Arena auf Bayer Leverkusen. Mit den Fans im Rücken wollen wir nach zwei Siegen aus zwei Spielen weiter punkten! 

Tonight we will face Bayer Leverkusen in the Allianz Arena. With our fans behind us it is our goal to go for the third win this season! #packmas, In der UEFA Champions League erwarten uns Arsenal London, Olympiakos Piräus und Dinamo Zagreb. Bekanntlich gibt es in der Königsklasse keine leichten Gegner. Deshalb werden wir alles daran setzen, die Gruppenphase erfolgreich abzuschließen. Wir freuen uns auf die Herausforderung!

The Champions League draw brought us Arsenal London, Olympiacos Piraeus and Dinamo Zagreb. It is well known that there are no easy opponents in this tournament. This is why we will give it our best to complete the group stage successfully. We are looking forward to this challenge!, Traditionelles Trachten-Shooting beim FC Bayern Munich.

Traditional shooting dressed in Lederhosen., 85 Jahre Sixtus-Geschichte in einer Vitrine ☺, Ich bin von euch und euren Bildern begeistert. Jede Woche treffe ich eine Auswahl eurer besten Fotos, die ihr mit dem Hashtag #LahmFanFoto hochgeladen habt. Heute zeige ich euch eine Auswahl an Porträts:

I am very excited about all of your images. Every week I am selecting your best photos that you have uploaded using the hashtag #LahmFanFoto. Click here for the gallery:

Follow me: https://instagram.com/philipplahm/, Das letzte Philipp Lahm Sommercamp ging am Samstag zu Ende. Das Konzept wurde mit Hilfe von erfahrenen Pädagogen und Sportwissenschaftler entwickelt und als offizielles UNESCO Dekade-Projekt für nachhaltige Entwicklung ausgezeichnet. 

Am Ende der Woche soll jedes Kind mit neuen Eindrücken und Erfahrungen nach Hause gehen – und sicherlich auch mit vielen neuen Freunden. Danke an alle Kinder und Helfer!, Bisher konnten die Hoffenheimer in der Bundesligageschichte noch keinen Sieg gegen den FC Bayern Munich erlangen. Wir werden alles geben, dass es dabei bleibt 😉

So far, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim never managed to win against FC Bayern. We will give it our best to keep it that way 😉 #packmas, Fast die Hälfte aller Toraktionen galten früher als zufällig. Heute versuchen Wissenschaftler mit Hilfe von Daten den Fußball noch berechenbarer zu machen. Bei der WM habe ich das erste Mal intensiv mit den Datenspezialisten zusammengearbeitet. Spannend, so eine andere Perspektive auf die Spielsituationen zu bekommen. Doch trotz Datenanalyse wird der Fußball immer Überraschungen mit sich bringen – zum Glück für Spieler und Fans.


In the past almost half of the attacks that led to a goal were considered a coincidence. Nowadays scientists try to make the game more predictable by using data-driven technology. At the World Cup I had the opportunity to work with data-experts. It is exciting to see the game from a different perspective. Despite this kind of analysis soccer will always cause surprises – luckily for players and fans., Wer hat wohl den Ball bekommen – Arjen oder Thomas Müller? 😉

Who do you think got the ball – Arjen or Thomas? 😉, Das Philipp Lahm Sommercamp geht für dieses Jahr in die letzte Runde. Eines der 80 Kinder ist Benedikt, der kleine Pechvogel des Merkur CUP´s. Beim Fußballturnier verletzte er sich an der Schulter und darf als Trost diese Woche im Sommercamp verbringen. Dir und allen anderen Kindern viel Spaß!

The Philipp Lahm Summer Camp is taking place for the last time this year. One of the 80 kids is Benedikt. The little unlucky fellow hurt his shoulder at the Merkur Cup and – as a consolation – will participate at the Summer Camp. Have fun, kids!, 5 Millionen Facebook-Fans. Vielen Dank an jeden Einzelnen von euch! 

We reached 5 million fans on Facebook. Thanks to each & every one of you!, Vor 6 Jahren durfte ich das erste Mal von Beginn an für meinen Verein FC Bayern München als Kapitän auflaufen – für den verletzten Mark van Bommel.  Auch wenn wir gegen SV Werder Bremen nur 1:1 unentschieden spielten, gewannen wir am Ende die Meisterschaft.

Six years ago I started for the first time as the captain of FC Bayern München. It was a replacement for Mark van Bommel who was injured. Even though the game against  SV Werder Bremen ended in a 1:1 draw, we finished the Bundesliga as champions. #Throwback, null, Gute Reporter schaffen es dann doch immer mal wieder heikle Informationen heraus zu kitzeln. Sorry Thomas Müller, das musste mal gesagt werden ;-)

Sometimes good reporters manage to extract rare statements. Sorry Thomas, but this had to be said ;), Ein großer Dank geht heute an meine Fans. Schaut euch die besten #LahmFanFoto´s an. Die sind wirklich super. Hier geht`s zur Galerie:

A big thank you to my fans today. Check out the best #LahmFanFotos. They are really incredible. Click here for the gallery:

And follow me on Instagram: https://instagram.com/philipplahm/, Ich freue mich sehr, dass ich dieses Jahr zum fünften Mal ein Philipp Lahm Sommercamp in Kooperation mit der José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung veranstalten kann. Die Teilnehmer dieser Sommercampwoche sind ehemals leukämiekranke Kinder, die jeweils einen Freund, eine Freundin oder ein Geschwisterkind mitnehmen können. Das Konzept bleibt dabei gleich und stellt den 80 Kindern spannende Aufgaben zu den Bereichen Ernährung, Bewegung und Persönlichkeit. Ausführliche Informationen gibt es hier: www.philipp-lahm-sommercamp.de

This year I'm very happy to host the Philipp Lahm Summer Camp in cooperation with the José Carreras Leukemia Foundation for the fifth time. The participants of the camp are kids who formerly suffered from leukemia. They are all allowed to bring a friend, brother or sister along. The concept stays the same as the 80 kids are given tasks from different aspects such as nutrition, movement and personality. For detailed information visit: www.philipp-lahm-sommercamp.de, Die Skill-Challenge läuft und hoffentlich auch das Trainingslager, lieber Tobias Hauke ;) #SkillsforRio

The skill-challenge is going well and hopefully the training camp too ;), Mit dem gestrigen Pokalspiel hat die neue Saison endlich angefangen. Ich freue mich, wenn am Freitag auch der Startschuss für die Bundesliga fällt.

With yesterday's first round of the DFB Cup the new season has finally started. Now I´m looking forward to our first Bundesliga Match on Friday., Wenn die Stimmung wie im Video ist, dann wird es eine ganz schön heiße Partie im Wildparkstadion. Wir freuen uns auf den FC Nöttingen 1957 e.V. #dfbpokal

Once the atmosphere is just like in the video, it’ll be a pretty sizzling match at Wildparkstadion. We are looking forward to playing against FC Nöttingen. #MiaSanMia, Heute geht das erste Sommercamp mit meinem Partner FTI Touristik zu Ende. Am Wichtigsten ist mir, dass ihr Spaß hattet. Und davon konnte ich mich selbst überzeugen :), Danke für eure Unterstützung auf Instagram!
Thanks for the great support on Instagram!
 
Follow me: https://instagram.com/philipplahm/, Ein positives Arbeitsklima ist Grundvoraussetzung, damit ein Team langfristig funktioniert und erfolgreich sein kann. Auch in meiner Sixtus-Mannschaft kommt der Spaß nicht zu kurz., Heute Abend geht es im #AudiCup2015 gegen den A.C. Milan. Ich freue mich auf das erste Spiel dieser Saison in der Allianz Arena! #packmas

Tonight we will take on AC Milan. I’m looking forward to playing the first match of the season at the Allianz Arena., Fußballprofi muss man nicht sein – in meinem Sommercamp sind Neugier und Abenteuerlust die entscheidenden Erfolgsfaktoren! Seit drei Tagen sind die Kinder nun im Philipp Lahm Sommercamp: Die Teams haben sich mit beeindruckenden Schlachtrufen ausgerüstet und sind fleißig dabei die Entdeckeraufträge zu lösen. 

Für die restliche Sommercamp Woche wünsche ich allen Teilnehmern noch eine tolle Zeit mit vielen Erlebnissen und neuen Erfahrungen, die ihr mit nach Hause nehmen könnt!, Genau heute vor 12 Jahren durfte ich im Trikot des VfB zum ersten Mal als Bundesligaprofi auflaufen. In der 76. Minute wurde ich unter Trainer Felix Magath eingewechselt und konnte am Ende mit der Mannschaft einen 2:0-Sieg gegen Hansa Rostock feiern. Ein ganz besonderer Moment, den ich sicherlich nie vergessen werde! #Throwback

12 years ago I played my first game as a professional football player for VfB Stuttgart. Felix Magath was coach back then and I got in as a substitute in the 76. minute. In the end we won 2:0 against Hansa Rostock and I was very happy to celebrate my first victory with the team. I will never forget this very special moment in my career!, Mit dem FTI-Sommercamp beginnt morgen das erste von insgesamt drei Philipp Lahm Sommercamps in diesem Jahr. Für 80 Kinder heißt es dann, Entdeckeraufträge annehmen und knifflige Aufgaben gemeinsam im Team lösen. Es gibt eine Menge zu den Themen Ernährung, Bewegung und Persönlichkeit zu lernen! 

Ich freue mich schon wieder sehr auf die Erlebnisberichte der Kinder und wünsche allen Teilnehmern eine spannende Woche!, Lieblingsdisziplin eines jeden Fußballers: Stabi-Übungen mit dem Ball ;)

Every footballer's favorite strengthening exercise: one with a ball ;-), Ich bin immer noch stolz, dass ich auf Anhieb das Sixtus-Duschbad erkannt habe ☺, Bei DER Überschrift musste ich einfach weiterlesen. Interessante Idee, im Unternehmen so etwas wie einen Kapitän einzuführen, der zwischen Chef und Team vermitteln kann. Dabei hängt der Erfolg auf dem Platz – genauso wie im Büro – vor allem von einer guten Kommunikation ab. Die Frage, wie ich als Mitarbeiter wäre, bleibt jedoch noch offen ;), Zum Start von Instagram vor ein paar Wochen habe ich euch gebeten, eure besten #LahmFanFoto´s hochzuladen. Inzwischen sind es richtig viele. Dankeschön! Hier geht`s zur Galerie:

For the launch of my Instagram a few weeks ago I asked you to upload your best #LahmFanFotos. There are really a large amount of entries. Thank you! Check out the Gallery:

Follow me on instagram: www.instagram.com/philipplahm, I'm looking very closely at all the great images you sent me. Post your favorite fan photos using the hashtag #LahmFanFoto and I will upload a small selection of them every week., Bei den Dehnübungen am Montagmorgen sind die Knochen doch noch etwas müde. ;-), Nach einer langen Reise sind wir wieder in Deutschland angekommen. Während der Zeit in China konnten wir viele neue Erfahrungen und Eindrücke sammeln. Vor allem Geschwindigkeit, Dimensionen und Energie, die in diesem Land herrschen, sind beeindruckend. Schön zu wissen, dass FC Bayern Munich-Fans auf der ganzen Welt zusammenhalten.

On our tour we gained plenty of new experiences. I was impressed by the speed, dimensions and energy of the country in particular. It´s great to see FC Bayern Munich-Fans all over the world as one big family! #AudiFCBTour, Wir haben eine tolle Reise durch China hinter uns. Es waren spannende Spiele. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit, die Heimreise anzutreten und in München an den Feinheiten für die neue Bundesliga-Saison zu feilen. 

Amazing fans, beautiful cities and exciting games - the trip to China was great. But now it’s time to go home and work on details in order to be ready for the upcoming season.
#AudiFCBTour #MiaSanMia, Die letzte Station unserer Reise heißt Guangzhou. Da es bisher nur gegen europäische Teams ging, freut es mich umso mehr, heute gegen die Guangzhou Evergrande aus China anzutreten. 

Guangzhou: the last stop of our journey. As we have faced two European teams so far I am excited to compete against Guangzhou Evergrande from China.
#AudiFCBTour #MiaSanMia, Schön auch mal etwas mehr Zeit für unsere FC Bayern Munich-Fans in China zu haben. Über das selbst gemachte Fan-Album habe ich mich sehr gefreut. #AudiFCBTour

It's nice to spend a decent amount of time with our FCB fans in China. I was very delighted by the self-made fan-album. Thank you!
#MiaSanMia, Mit etwas Verspätung kommt hier ein kleines Zwischenfazit von unserer Chinareise. #AudiFCBtour, Gute Nacht aus Shanghai!, Das Spiel gegen den FC Valencia in Peking war der erste große Test mit der neuen FC Bayern Munich Mannschaft. Es hat Spaß gemacht, so weit weg von zuhause vor so vielen Fans zu spielen. Umso schöner, dass dann auch noch das Ergebnis gestimmt hat :-)  #AudiFCBTour 

The match against FC Valencia in Beijing was our first major test with the new FC Bayern team. It was fun to be so far away from home and yet play in front of so many fans. What made it even better was that we got a great result :-) #AudiFCBTour, Mit voller Konzentration ging es heute in die erste Trainingseinheit in Shanghai. Danach habe ich mir Zeit für unsere Fans genommen. Die Unterstützung der Fans in China ist großartig.

Fully concentrated we started our first training session in Shanghai. Afterwards I took some time for our fans. The support of the Chinese fans is simply amazing. #AudiFCBTour, Thomas Müller und ich haben uns heute mal an einem etwas kleineren Ball probiert. An der Reaktionsfähigkeit müssen wir noch etwas arbeiten ;-), Bald beginnt unser erstes Freundschaftsspiel in China gegen eine starke Mannschaft aus Valencia. Ich freue mich auf diese Herausforderung im Bird's Nest. 

I am lookig forward to our friendly match against FC Valencia in the famous Bird's Nest stadium im Beijing. #AudiFCBTour, Nach einem ruhigen Flug sind wir gut in Peking angekommen. Über den unglaublich emotionalen Empfang unserer Fans habe ich mich sehr gefreut!

After a safe flight we have arrived in Beijing. I was overwhelmed by the emotional welcome by our Chinese fans. I am very much looking forward to the next days! #AudiFCBTour, Gleich geht es los nach China mit dem FC Bayern Munich und Manuel Neuer. Ich freue mich auf die Reise.

About to head to China with FC Bayern Munich and Manuel Neuer. I'm looking forward to the big journey! #AudiFCBTour, Nichts zu danken, Moritz Fürste. Beim Thema Treffsicherheit ist ja noch Luft nach oben ;-) Aber ihr habt ja noch ein Jahr Zeit eure #SkillsforRio zu verfeinern.

Follow me on instagram: www.instagram.com/philipplahm, Die Vorbereitungen auf unsere Chinatour sind schon in vollem Gange. Wir werden nach Peking, Shanghai und Guangzhou reisen und ich recherchiere schon mal die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten. Was muss man sich in den drei Städten auf jeden Fall anschauen – habt ihr Tipps?
#AudiFCBTour

The preparations on our China-Tour are already well underway. We will travel to Bejing, Shanghai and Guangzhou and I’m already researching the most important sights. What are the must-sees in the three cities? Any advice?, Lieber Bastian Schweinsteiger,
seit unserem 16. Lebensjahr stehen wir gemeinsam auf dem Platz: Von der FC Bayern Munich A-Jugend haben wir den Sprung zu den Profis geschafft und 10 Jahre gemeinsam in der Nationalmannschaft gespielt. 
Letztes Jahr haben wir mit dem Weltmeistertitel das Größte erreicht, das es im Profifußball zu gewinnen gibt. Mit keinem anderen Mitspieler habe ich so viele Höhen und Tiefen erlebt, mit keinem anderen Teamkollegen so häufig die Fußballschuhe geschnürt. Deine Qualität und Verdienste auf dem Platz stehen außer Frage. Der Grund, warum dein Abschied aber zurecht Zeitungsseiten füllt, hat für mich die Süddeutsche Zeitung (heutige Seite Drei) auf den Punkt gebracht: Du bist jemand, der sich nie in der Lederhose präsentiert hat, sondern einer, der sie einfach trägt. 
Dein Philipp

Dear Bastian, 
since we were 16 we have stood on the pitch together: From the Bayern A-Youth we made the jump to the first team and played together on the national team for 10 years. By winning the World Cup last year we won the biggest trophy that there is to win in professional football. With no other teammate have I experienced so many ups and downs or laced up my boots more often. Your quality and achievements on the pitch are incredible. Yet the reason why your goodbye understandably fills the tabloid pages has been expressed by the Süddeutsche Zeitung (today's Seite Drei): You never were one that presents himself grandly in lederhosen, you just wear them naturally. 
Your Philipp
#DankeBasti, Heute vor einem Jahr ging mit dem Gewinn der WM in Rio de Janeiro mein ganz persönlicher Traum in Erfüllung. Unsere Olympioniken haben kommendes Jahr die gleiche Chance, ganz oben zu stehen. Moritz Fürste, wie laufen bei euch Hockey-Jungs die Vorbereitungen für Rio? #Rückendeckung, Mit diesem Spielergebnis konnte niemand rechnen: In Belo Horizonte schlugen wir Gastgeber Brasilien im Halbfinale mit 7:1. Der 8. Juli 2014, ein Tag, der in die WM-Geschichte eingegangen ist. #throwback

Nobody expected this outcome: In Belo Horizonte we beat the host nation, Brazil, in the semifinals 7:1 on July 8, 2014, a day that has gone down in World Cup history.

Follow me on instagram: www.instagram.com/philipplahm, Hochmotiviert und voller Elan geht’s heute in die neue Trainingswoche 😉

Very motivated and full of energy to start off the new training week., Heute stand Sixtus Markenbotschafter Konstantin Schad zusammen mit dem „Team Gold“ der Deutschen Sporthilfe gegen Borussia Dortmund auf dem Fußballplatz. Eine schöne Sache! Die Einnahmen der Partie kommen der Deutsche Sporthilfe zu Gute., Heute vor einem Jahr schlugen wir in Rio de Janeiro die Équipe Tricolore mit 1:0 und kamen so dem WM-Finale einen Schritt näher. Mats Hummels traf mit dem Kopf und sicherte uns den Viertelfinal-Sieg.
#throwback

One year ago today we beat the Équipe Tricolore 1-0 in Rio de Janeiro and came one step closer to the World Cup final. A header from Mats Hummels lead us to a quarterfinal victory.

Follow me on instagram: www.instagram.com/philipplahm, Eure Bilder sind wirklich toll. Jede Woche schaue ich mir eure #LahmFanFotos an und bin immer noch begeistert. Und hier kommt die heutige #LahmFanFoto-Auswahl.

Your pictures are really great. I am still very excited to see your #LahmFanFotos every week. Here is the most recent #LahmFanFoto selection:, Ein Blick hinter die Kulissen von Sixtus war nicht nur spannend, sondern auch wichtig, um die Abläufe zu verstehen. Zudem hatte ich die Gelegenheit, einige Mitarbeiter kennenzulernen., Erste Trainingseinheit erfolgreich absolviert. Schön, wieder bei der Mannschaft zu sein!

Completed the first training session of the new season today. It feels great to be back with the team., Das wohl kniffligste Spiel des ganzen WM-Turniers: In der Verlängerung entschieden wir das Achtelfinale gegen das starke Team von Algerien 2:1 für uns und zogen in die nächste Runde ein. #throwback

This was probably the trickiest match of the entire World Cup: In extra time we scored the decisive goal to advance past a strong Algerian team 2:1 into the next round.

Follow me on instagram: www.instagram.com/philipplahm, Morgen ist es soweit, wir starten wieder mit  dem Training. Freut ihr euch auch so sehr wie ich auf die neue Saison?

Tomorrow we start training again. Are you looking forward to the new season as much as I am?, In Brasilien erlebten wir die gesamt Wetterbandbreite. Im strömenden Regen traten wir vor einem Jahr in Recife gegen die USA an. Meiner Meinung nach unser bestes WM-Spiel. Trotz der aggressiven Spielweise der Amerikaner kontrollierten wir die Partie von Anfang an und zogen Dank Thomas Müller mit 1:0 ins Achtelfinale ein. #throwback

In Brazil, we experienced the full spectrum of weather. A year ago in Recife we played in the pouring rain against the US. In my opinion, that was our best World Cup game. Despite the aggressive tactics from the American side, we controlled the game from the start and advanced to the second round with a 1:0 win thanks to Thomas Müller.

Follow me on instagram: www.instagram.com/philipplahm, Viele deutsche Olympioniken müssen ihre Sportkarriere aus finanziellen Gründen beenden. Die Deutsche Sportlotterie ist eine gemeinnützige Organisation, die genau diese Profiathleten unterstützt. Vielen ist diese Problematik nicht bewusst. Ich möchte mithelfen, dass sich das ändert!

Click here to view the gallery:, Im Laufe meiner Fußballerkarriere habe ich viele Dinge gelernt – vor allem, dass Sport Disziplin, Respekt, Ehrgeiz und Teamfähigkeit vermittelt. Denn das sind alles Fähigkeiten, die auch im Leben abseits von Sportplätzen hilfreich sind. Dazu habe ich heute einen interessanten Artikel gefunden. Auch in den Südafrika-Projekten meiner Stiftung geht es genau darum: über Fußballtraining Werte zu vermitteln, die Jugendlichen helfen sich im Alltag besser zurechtzufinden., Heute vor einem Jahr spielten wir in einem spannenden WM-Spiel 2:2 gegen Ghana. Mein Mannschaftskamerad Miroslav Klose sicherte uns in Fortaleza mit seinem Treffer das Unentschieden und wurde damit WM-Rekordtorschütze.

One year ago today we tied Ghana 2:2 in an exciting World Cup matchup. My teammate Miroslav Klose secured us in the Fortaleza with his game tying goal and also broke the record for most goals in a World Cup. #throwback

Als Botschafter der AOK-on-Initiative „Gesunde Kinder – gesunde Zukunft“ freue ich mich, die damit eingeleiteten Aktionswochen im Jubiläumsjahr als Schirmherr zu unterstützen.

Die Stimmung in der Mannschaft war überragend, jeder war heiß auf die Weltmeisterschaft. Wir haben vom ersten Tag an voll konzentriert trainiert und so den Grundstein für unseren gemeinsamen Erfolg gelegt.

A year and a day ago we landed in the World Cup-quarters at Campo Bahia in Santo André. The collective team attitude was outstanding, everyone was extremely excited for the World Cup. From the first day on, we were all fully focused and fit which laid the foundation for our overall success.

Februar 2015 feierte der FC Bayern München gegen Köln 115-jährigen Geburtstag und die Mannschaft bescherte mit dem 4:1-Heimsieg ein 3 Punkte-Geschenk! Aufgrund meiner Sprunggelenksverletzung stand ich bei diesem Jubiläum leider nicht selbst auf dem Platz.

On the 27th February 2015 the FC Bayern celebrated their 115th Birthday and the Team gave a 3-Point present with the 4-1 home victory against Cologne. 
Because of my ankle injury, I could sadly not be on the pitch myself. #throwback

Eine Auswahl der besten Bilder werde ich hier auf Facebook und bei Instagram veröffentlichen. Ich freue mich auf eure Bilder!

Upload your best fan photo with the hashtag #LahmFanFoto. I'll be releasing a collection of the best pictures here on Facebook and on Instagram! I'm looking forward to see your photos!

Follow this link: www.instagram.com/philipplahm, Nach einer ereignisreichen Saison, in der wir deutliche Siege feiern durften, aber auch einige bittere Niederlagen einstecken mussten, steht am Samstag das letzte Bundesligaspiel gegen Mainz an. 
Im Hinblick auf mögliche Personalentscheidungen für die neue Saison bin ich davon überzeugt, dass die aktuelle Mannschaft noch einen Champions-League-Sieg in sich hat.
Ich freue mich auf den letzten Spieltag und die Meisterschaftsfeier mit der Mannschaft.

After an eventful season in which we had decisive victories to celebrate but also bitter defeats to suffer, we are facing the last match of the season this Saturday. Regarding any staff decision making I am convinced that the current team still carries another champions league title inside them. I am looking forward to the last Matchday and the celebrations  with the team for winning the league., Das hat bestimmt schon jeder festgestellt: Kinder machen alles nach! Daher ist es umso wichtiger, dass Richtige vorzumachen. Haltet solche Szenen fest und gewinnt mit etwas Glück beim AOK - Die Gesundheitskasse. #Gewinnspiel einen gemeinsamen Tag mit mir. Als Botschafter der AOK Initiative „Gesunde Kinder – gesunde Zukunft“ will ich selbst Vorbild sein und freue mich auf eure Einsendungen. 

Für weitere Infos einfach hier entlang: http://bit.ly/1R0bq0f, #packmas, Im Abschlusstraining haben wir heute am letzten Feinschliff für das morgige Spiel gegen Freiburg gearbeitet.

Ahead of the game against Freiburg we were working on the last details in today's training session., So eine Stimmung wie beim gestrigen Spiel habe ich selten erlebt, einfach sensationell. Die Mannschaft hat an das Wunder geglaubt und alles gegeben. Wir haben gezeigt, dass wir verdient im Halbfinale der Champions League standen, leider konnten wir den 0:3 Rückstand aus dem Hinspiel nicht mehr ausgleichen. Auf diesem Weg nochmal ein riesiges Dankeschön an unsere Fans für die Unterstützung!

An atmosphere like yesterday is something I have rarely witnessed, simply sensational! The Team believed in the miracle and gave everything. We’ve shown that we’ve earned our spot in the semi finals but sadly couldn't recover from the 0:3 defeat in the first leg. Here is another huge thank you to all of our fans for their support!, #packmas, Herzlichen Glückwunsch an die FCB Frauen zum Gewinn der Deutschen Meisterschaft!
Im Moment nutzen wir unsere Chancen einfach nicht. Die Niederlage gegen Augsburg am Samstag war unnötig, wir schauen jetzt aber nach vorne und konzentrieren uns voll auf das morgige Rückspiel gegen Barcelona.

Congratulations to the FCB womens team for winning the German League!
Currently we are just not taking our chances. The defeat against Augsburg last Saturday was unnecessary. But now we are looking ahead and fully focus ourselves on the second leg against Barcelona., #packmas, Wir haben gut gearbeitet, hatten eine Riesenmöglichkeit, haben das Spiel lange offen gelassen. Doch dann machen wir die entscheidenden Fehler, die zu Gegentoren führen. Wir haben es Barcelona zu einfach gemacht, haben einen Ballverlust und der Gegner kann kontern. Vor allem auswärts darf uns das nicht passieren. Man kann 0:1 in Rückstand geraten, aber dann darf es nicht 0:3 ausgehen.

We were playing well, had a huge chance and kept the game open for a long time. But then we made decisive mistakes that lead to the goals against us. After losing the ball, we made it too easy for Barcelona on the counter attack. Especially being away from home this cannot happen. Being behind 0:1 in regulation time is understandable but the final score ending 0:3 is not., Jetzt zählt es! #packmas

Game on!, Morgen ist eines der schwierigsten, aber auch wichtigsten Spiele der Champions League. Das Team ist voll konzentriert und hat im Abschlusstraining noch mal alles gegeben. Mit euch im Rücken haben wir jedoch volles Vertrauen, dass wir es schaffen können. #packmas 

Tomorrow is one of the most difficult but also most important matches of the Champions League. The team is fully focussed and has given their very best at the last training session before the match. With your support we have absolute faith that we can co it!, Kein Spieler verliert gerne. Immer, wenn man das Feld betritt, gibt man sein Bestes, um am Ende auch zu gewinnen. Trotzdem war es dieses Mal das Wichtigste, dass sich niemand vor dem sehr wichtigen Spiel am Mittwoch verletzt hat.

No player likes losing and when you go out onto the field, it's always with the aim of playing well, doing your best and winning. The most important thing this time, however, is that we've all come through the game safely ahead of Wednesday., Der aktuelle EuroJackpot hat sicherlich viele Gelegenheitsspieler zum Ausfüllen eines Scheins motiviert. Die Gewinnchance liegt bei 1:95 Millionen. Wer dagegen Deutsche Sportlotterie spielt hat eine Chance von 1:3 Millionen und unterstützt dabei zusätzlich noch unsere Olympioniken! Sollte keine schwere Entscheidung sein, oder? 
Also an alle die heute Abend bei der Ziehung leer ausgehen: Niete eintauschen und bei uns spielen! #Rückendeckung, Spannende 3D Hologramm-Aufnahmen für das Deutsche Fußballmuseum: Ich konnte beim Hauptdreh im März in Frankfurt nicht dabei sein - meine Rolle hatte deshalb ein Double übernommen. Gestern wurden dann die Szenen mit mir nachproduziert und es hat richtig Spaß gemacht. Interessant zu sehen, was technisch alles möglich ist! Es lohnt sich sicherlich das Ergebnis mal vor Ort anzuschauen. Danke an Basti, dass du für die gemeinsamen Szenen nochmal extra dabei warst!

Exciting 3D hologram shooting for the German football museum: Sadly I couldn't be there at the main shoot in March in Frankfurt, therefore a double took my role instead. Then yesterday all my scenes were reshot and it was a lot of fun! Really interesting to see what's possibly with technology. It's surely worth it to go and check out the outcome on site! Thank you Basti for joining me for all our joined scenes once more!, Obwohl wir das Spiel über weite Teile dominiert haben und trotz zahlreicher Chancen, ist es uns nicht gelungen, die Partie in der regulären Spielzeit und der Verlängerung zu entscheiden. Im Elfmeterschießen gewinnt dann der Glücklichere. Das waren  gestern definitiv nicht wir. Glückwunsch an Borussia Dortmund!

Wir werden uns jetzt darauf konzentrieren schnell wieder fit zu werden. Denn nach dem Spiel gegen Leverkusen am Samstag, steht am Mittwoch bereits das nächste Halbfinale an. Dort wollen wir die Grundlage dafür erspielen, die Saison dennoch in Berlin abzuschließen! #MiaSanMia

Although, we were the stronger team for large parts of the match and despite numerous chances we weren’t able to decide this one in regular or even extra time. We all know that penalties are a gamble and the more fortunate team wins. Which definitely was not us yesterday. Congratulations to Borussia Dortmund! 

We now will focus all our attention on getting back in shape. After the match on Saturday against Leverkusen, it's already time for the next semi final. There, we are determined to lay a strong foundation for the 2nd leg so we can finish this season in Berlin after all. #MiaSanMia, Heute Abend können wir in der Allianz Arena gegen den BVB einen entscheidenden Schritt Richtung Titel Nummer Zwei machen. Wir zählen auf eure Unterstützung und werden alles geben! #packmas

Tonight, we are in the Allianz Arena against BVB to attempt to take a decisive step towards title number two. We are counting on your support and will give it our all! #packmas, Um die Wartezeit bis zum Spiel gegen Dortmund zu überbrücken, heute mal ein kurzes Video für euch. Das war eine Pressekonferenz ganz nach meinem Geschmack: top vorbereitete Journalisten, interessante Fragen und sogar was zu Trinken wurde mir noch gebracht ;-)

To bridge the waiting time until the match against Dortmund, here is a short video. This was definitely my kind of press conference: well prepared journalists, interesting questions and even had something to drink brought to me ;-), Die 25. Deutsche Meisterschaft für den FC Bayern Munich! Auch wenn wir heute nicht direkt im Stadion gemeinsam als Team und mit euch feiern können, ist es ein schönes Gefühl den Titel verteidigt zu haben! Ich freue mich schon jetzt auf den Balkon und eine gebührende Feier mit euch auf dem Marienplatz. Am besten natürlich mit mehr als der Meisterschale in der Hand... deshalb werden wir auch mit 100 prozentiger Konzentration am Dienstag in das Pokal-Halbfinale gegen den BVB gehen!

It's the 25th German Championship for FC Bayern! Although, we are not all at the Arena to celebrate as a team with you, it is still such a great feeling to have defended the title. I am very much looking forward to celebrating with you at Marienplatz and it would be great if we were crowned more than just German Champions by that time... that's why we will focus 100% on the DFB Cup semi final match against Dortmund next Tuesday., Mit unserem Los für das Champions League Halbfinale werden gute Erinnerungen geweckt: 2013 konnten wir uns im Halbfinale gegen den FC Barcelona durchsetzen und haben im Finale gegen Borussia Dortmund gewonnen.

The draw for the Champions League semifinals brings back good memories, 2013 we came out on top against FC Barcelona and won the title with our victory against Borussia Dortmund in the final.

#RoadToBerlin, Wir sind gestern vor einer ausverkauften Arena und mit der Unterstützung von Millionen von Fans ins Champions League Halbfinale eingezogen. Diese Begeisterung und Aufmerksamkeit hat mir einmal mehr gezeigt, dass ich mich als Profifußballer in einer absolut privilegierten Situation befinde.
 
Nur sehr wenige Spitzensportlern können sich  ihren Lebensunterhalt mit ihrem Sport verdienen, die meisten deutschen Olympioniken haben im Schnitt gerade einmal 626 € pro Monat zur Verfügung! Ein großer Anteil  erfolgreicher und sogar Medaillen dekorierter Athleten beendet die Karriere frühzeitig aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen.
 
Die Deutsche Sportlotterie möchte das ändern und ich helfe mit. Seit heute bin ich offiziell als Gesellschafter und Unterstützer dabei.
 
Unser gemeinsames Ziel ist es, dass auch Spitzensportler anderer Sportarten ohne Existenzsorgen trainieren können und der deutsche Hochleistungssport auch zukünftig im internationalen Vergleich wettbewerbsfähig bleibt.
 
Dafür brauchen wir eure Hilfe!
 
Schon mit 3 € seid ihr dabei! Damit könnt ihr selbst bis zu 500.000 € gewinnen oder ihr habt die Freude über den Sieg der unterstützen Sportler – ein unschlagbares Konzept, bei dem alle gewinnen.
 
Also auf geht`s: Gleich hier https://deutsche-sportlotterie.de/philipp-rueckendeckung.html mitspielen!, Gemeinsam schaffen wir es. Pack ma's!

Together we can do it. Let's go!, Das heutige Abschlusstraining zur Vorbereitung auf Porto war sehr gut. Das Team ist voll fokussiert auf morgen, um den Einzug ins Halbfinale zu sichern. Es wird ein schweres Spiel, aber mit der Unterstützung unserer Fans im Rücken wollen wir dieses Ziel erreichen!

Today's training session before the match against Porto was very good. It is going to be a tough game, but the team is fully focused and with great support from our fans we hope to make it to the semi finals., Mit dem 2:1 hätten wir gut leben können, das dritte Gegentor war extrem bitter. Ein 2:0 daheim ist schwierig, aber nicht unmöglich. Bei Porto sind im Rückspiel ein paar wichtige Spieler gesperrt. Wir müssen einfach unser Spiel spielen, uns über viel Ballbesitz Torchancen erarbeiten und diese verwandeln.

We could live with the score being 2-1 but the third goal was a let down. 2:0 at home is difficult, but not impossible. A few key players from Porto are out with yellow card accumulation in the second leg. We just have to play our game of possessing the ball and creating chances., Nach zuletzt 3 Siegen in Folge wollen wir heute im Hinspiel gegen Porto den Grundstein für die nächste Runde legen.

After winning 3 games in a row, today, in the first leg against Porto, we want to lay the foundation for the second leg.

#packmas, Nach dem Bundesliga-Sieg gegen Eintracht Frankfurt am Samstag, geht es heute mit dem FC Bayern Munich nach Porto. Am Mittwoch werden wir alles geben, um auch in der Champions League weiterhin erfolgreich zu sein. #MiaSanMia
---
After a Bundesliga win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, we are now heading to Porto. On Wednesday we will do everything possible to continue our success in the Champions League. #MiaSanMia, Im April wechselt bei uns nicht nur ständig das Wetter, sondern auch der Wettbewerb: vorgestern Pokalspiel, morgen Bundesliga und am Mittwoch dann Champions League. 
Das erfordert Fitness und Flexibilität ;-)
---
Not only does the weather keep changing in April, but also the competition: Day before yesterday DFB cup game, tomorrow Bundesliga and on Wednesday Champions League.
This requires fitness and flexibility ;-), Yesterday the team had an impressive performance. Playing Dortmund in the semi-final won't be any easier! 

#MiaSanMia, Die Mannschaft hat gestern eine Top-Leistung abgerufen, gegen Dortmund wird es im Halbfinale bestimmt nicht einfacher! #MiaSanMia, Am Samstag stand ich gegen Borussia Dortmund bereits 70 Minuten auf dem Platz, heute geht es im DFB Pokal gegen Bayer Leverkusen. #packmas

On Saturday I was able to play 70 minutes against Borussia Dortmund and today we face Bayer Leverkusen in the DFB Pokal., Morgen wartet ein Spiel mit langer Historie auf uns.

Tomorrow's match got a long history. 

#packmas, Eigentlich wäre ich heute Abend nach Kuala Lumpur eingeladen, wo die Verleihung des BrandLaureate Awards 2015 stattfindet.

Da eine solche Reise für mich während der Saison nur schwierig umsetzbar ist, habe ich Urkunde und Trophäe vorab per Post erhalten.

Vielen Dank für diese unkomplizierte Übergabe und die besondere Auszeichnung!, Es ist wirklich erstaunlich, wie viel kreative und einfallsreiche Fanpost mich aus China erreicht. Herzlichen Dank dafür! Ich habe mir gerne Zeit genommen, eure Fragen zu beantworten.

To end the week, here is a brief interview together with David Alaba. Have a great weekend!, Heute möchte ich die Länderspielpause für News aus der Philipp Lahm-Stiftung nutzen: Bei der Kuratoriumssitzung letzte Woche wurden zwei besondere Persönlichkeiten in das beratende Gremium der Philipp Lahm-Stiftung gewählt. Ich freue mich sehr, dass ich hiermit die weltbekannte Geigerin Anne-Sophie Mutter (© 2014 Dario Acosta / DG) und den Münchner Unternehmer Carl Geisel als neue Kuratoriumsmitglieder vorstellen darf. Nach dem Ausscheiden von Bundespräsident a.D. Prof. Dr. Roman Herzog aus der aktiven Stiftungstätigkeit (jetzt Ehrenmitglied des Kuratoriums) sowie dem Tod von Prof. Dr. Norbert Walter vor zwei Jahren, ist das Kuratorium somit wieder vollzählig. Vielen Dank schon vorab für Ihr Mitwirken und Engagement!

I am very pleased to announce, world-renowned violinist, Anne-Sophie Mutter (© 2014 Dario Acosta / DG) and, Munich entrepreneur, Carl Geisel as new board members. Following the resignation of President A.D. Prof. Dr. Roman Herzog from active participation in the Foundation (now an honorary member of the Board of Trustees) and the death of Prof. Dr. Norbert Walter, two years ago, the Board of Trustees is now complete again. Thank you in advance for your participation and support!, Heute hatte ich ein Wiedersehen mit einem ehemaligen Teamkollegen, der inzwischen die Seiten gewechselt hat ;-)
---
Today I had a reunion with a former teammate who has since changed sides ;-), Borussia Mönchengladbach hat gestern gut verteidigt, dennoch ist die Niederlage ärgerlich. Glücklicherweise haben auch unsere Verfolger nur unentschieden gespielt, sodass wir jetzt mit einem 10 Punkte Vorsprung in die Länderspielpause gehen können.
---
Borussia Mönchengladbach defended well yesterday, but defeat is always irritating. Fortunately, Wolfsburg only managed a draw in their match, so we can go with a 10-point lead into the international break., null, Schön wieder auf dem Platz zu sein!
---
Nice to be back on the pitch! #MiaSanMia, Seit der WM hat sich bei mir ziemlich viel Fanpost angesammelt. Aber ich bin fleißig dabei, alles abzuarbeiten. Vielen Dank für eure Geduld!

Thank you guys!, Die Partnerschaft zwischen der José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung und meinem Sommercamp verdeutlicht mir immer wieder, dass Gesundheit das wichtigste Gut im Leben und leider nicht selbstverständlich ist. Ich bewundere José Carreras für seinen nachhaltigen und engagierten Kampf gegen Leukämie und freue mich, dass ich letzten Dezember beim 20-jährigen Gala-Jubiläum der Deutschen José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung dabei sein konnte. In diesem Jahr dürfen wir ein kleines gemeinsames Jubiläum feiern, denn unsere Partnerschaft geht in diesem August bereits ins fünfte Jahr. Alle weiteren Informationen zum Sommercamp und zur Anmeldung findet ihr hier:

The partnership between José Carreras Leukemia Foundation and my summer camp shows me again and again that health is the most important asset in life, which goes without saying. I admire José Carreras for his sustained and committed fight against leukemia and am glad that I could be there last December on the 20 year anniversary gala of the German José Carreras Leukemia Foundation. In August, we will be able to celebrate a common anniversary as our partnership will be in its fifth year. All other information about summer camp and registration can be found here :

Geburtstag hat sich der FC Bayern München mit dem 4:1-Sieg gegen Köln selbst ein schönes Geschenk gemacht. Mein Einfluss auf diese Treffer hat sich noch auf`s Anfeuern beschränkt, aber wie ihr sehen könnt, feile ich schon wieder an meiner Schusstechnik, um bald wieder auf der Torschützenliste zu stehen…ok, ok! Oder zumindest in der Entstehung wieder mitzuwirken ;-)  #MiaSan115

On its 115th birthday, FC Bayern gave itself the beautiful gift of a 4-1 victory over Cologne. My influence on these results is only limited to cheering the team on but as you can see i'm working again on my shooting technique to get back on the scoresheet ... ok, ok! Or at least to participate again in the formation ;-) #MiaSan115, Lustiger Dreh mit meinem Stiftungspartner AOK. Kampagnen Start im Mai. Zur Ablenkung gibt es bis dahin zum Glück noch das ein oder andere Fußballspiel. Ich mach mich jetzt auf den Weg zum Geburtstagsheimspiel in die Allianz Arena.

Fun shooting today with my foundation partner AOK. Campaigns are starting in May. Fortunately, there are still many football games left until then. Now I am on my way to the 115th birthday and home game in Allianz Arena. #MiaSan115, Mit der heutigen Auftaktveranstaltung fällt der offizielle Startschuss für den Merkur CUP 2015, das größten E-Jugend-Turnier der Welt. Bei diesem Fußballfest steht nicht nur der Sport im Vordergrund, sondern auch die Vermittlung von Werten wie Toleranz und Verantwortung, Respekt und Akzeptanz. Deshalb freut es mich besonders, dass ich dieses Jahr die Schirmherrschaft bereits zum zweiten Mal übernehmen darf.
 
Den Rahmenterminplan und weitere interessante Informationen zum Merkur CUP findet ihr hier:

Thomas shuffling the deck. I'll be back soon!, Beim Spiel am Wochenende wäre ich gerne selbst auf dem Platz gestanden, aber mein Training hat von Tag zu Tag mehr mit Fußball zu tun. #comebacksoon 
---
In the game on the weekend I would have liked to get back on the pitch but for now my day to day training has more to do with the football. #comebacksoon, Klasse Jungs! #Auswärtssieg #MiaSanMia, Mit diesem Lob habe ich nicht gerechnet. Da habe ich möglicherweise wohl ein weiteres Projekt für die Zeit nach meiner Fußballkarriere :-)  #learnchinese

I did not expect all the praise. There just might be other potential projects for the time after my football career :-)  #learnchinese, Neujahrsgrüße an meine Fans in China! Nicht schlecht, oder?

Happy New Year to all of my fans in China! Not bad, right?, #packmas, Am Samstag der 8:0-Sieg der Mannschaft, ich habe wieder mit dem Lauftraining begonnen und heute ist Rosenmontag: Genügend Gründe, um Fasching zu feiern. Hier ein paar Inspirationen für die Verkleidungs-Unentschlossenen
---
The teams 8-0 victory on Saturday, beginning running training and today being Rose Monday are enough reasons to celebrate Carnival. Here is some inspiration for those who are still undecided, Nachdem meine Teamkollegen vom FC Bayern Munich am Samstag die nächsten 3 Punkte eingefahren haben, habe ich hoffentlich die letzten Kilometer auf dem Fahrrad absolviert. Ich bin optimistisch, Ende dieser Woche mit dem Lauftraining beginnen zu können! #nomorecycling, null, Morgen ist es soweit, der offizielle Startschuss für die Zusammenarbeit mit meinem neuen Partner Sixtus fällt im Rahmen einer Pressekonferenz auf der ISPO. 

In der SPORT BILD könnt ihr heute schon ein bisschen mehr über meinen Schritt ins Unternehmertum erfahren., Zur Einstimmung auf den Heimspieltag hatte ich heute ein sehr interessantes Interview mit der Buchautorin Elke Reichart zum Thema Respekt im Sport - innerhalb einer Mannschaft, vor der Leistung anderer, vor dem Gegner, im Sieg und in der Niederlage.

Ich finde ein sehr schönes aktuelles Beispiel war die besondere Gedenkminute an Junior Malanda letzten Freitag. Eine Geste die Respekt vor einem Menschen, seiner Kultur und seiner Leistung als Spieler zum Ausdruck gebracht hat.

Weniger schön war dann das Spielergebnis aus unserer Perspektive, da wir uns unseren Rückrundenstart natürlich anders vorgestellt haben. Aber bereits heute haben wir gegen Schalke ja die Chance auf Wiedergutmachung und 3 Punkte!#MiaSanMia, #packmas, null, Letzte Woche hatte ich einen spannenden Termin mit meinem Partner FTI Touristik, der auch in diesem Jahr wieder eines der Philipp Lahm Sommercamps, das „FTI Sommercamp“, vollständig finanziert. Spätestens nach diesem Drehtag ist meine Vorfreude auf die Camps wieder geweckt und auch der Startschuss für die Bewerbungen für das FTI-Camp ist bereits gefallen. Wie es genau funktioniert könnt Ihr unter www.fti-sommercamp.de nachlesen. Ich drücke allen Bewerbern die Daumen und bedanke mich bei FTI nochmals für den entspannten Nachmittag und die tolle Unterstützung!, Gestern war ich in Zürich und durfte im Rahmen der Verleihung des FIFA Ballon d’Or die Ehrung für die Wahl in die FIFA/FIFPro World XI-Weltauswahl 2014 entgegennehmen. Es war ein feierlicher Abend und ich freue mich sehr, dass ich nach 2013 erneut in die „Traum-Elf“ gewählt wurde. Ich möchte mich bei allen Fußball-Kollegen bedanken, die bei der Abstimmung teilgenommen haben. 

An dieser Stelle natürlich auch herzliche Glückwunsche an alle anderen Gewinnern/innen, die gestern ausgezeichnet wurden. Ich hoffe, ihr hattet alle so einen schönen Abend wie ich. So kann es 2015 weiter gehen :-), Zunächst wünsche ich euch allen noch ein gesundes und erfolgreiches Jahr 2015!
 
Das neue Jahr ist gerade ein paar Tage alt und ich habe schon wieder Grund zur Freude. Ihr habt mich bei der Abstimmung des UEFA TEAM OF THE YEAR 2014 in die Top-Elf gewählt. Herzlichen Dank an alle die mitgemacht haben! Es ist sehr schön nach 2006, 2008, 2012 und 2013 zum fünften Mal zum Kreis solcher Ausnahmespieler zu gehören. 
 
Die überwältigende Teilnahme von über 8,4 Millionen Fans weltweit macht diese Wahl zu etwas ganz Besonderem. Es freut mich, dass meine FCB-Teamkollegen Manuel Neuer, David Alaba sowie Arjen Robben und auch mein ehemaliger FCB- und Nationalmannschaft-Kollege Toni Kroos ebenfalls ins UEFA TEAM OF THE YEAR 2014 gewählt wurden. Das unterstreicht nochmal unseren Erfolg mit Club und Nationalmannschaft in diesem unvergesslichen Jahr 2014. 
 
Herzlichen Dank und ein schönes Wochenende euch. Viele Grüße auch an meine FCB-Kollegen in Katar.

Ein wirklich netter Einstieg in einen angenehmen Abend gestern beim Audi Star Talk - Sportstars hautnah erleben:, Nach den ersten beiden Wochen Ruhe und Reha, möchte ich euch eine kurze Zwischenmeldung geben: Die Heilung verläuft bisher ohne Komplikationen und abgesehen davon, dass ich durch Aircast-Stiefel und Krücken recht eingeschränkt bin, geht es mir gut. Bei den kommenden Spielen würde ich natürlich sehr viel lieber auf dem Platz stehen, als sie mit hochgelagertem Bein auf der Couch zu verfolgen, aber ich versuche es positiv zu sehen und die viele Zeit mit meiner Familie zu genießen.

Am Sonntag steht zur Abwechslung die FC Bayern Weihnachtsfeier auf dem Programm, am Montag bin ich Gast im Audi Star Talk.

Ich freue mich darauf, bei beiden Anlässen auf das sehr schöne und erfolgreiche Jahr 2014 zurückzublicken., Zum zweiten Mal in dieser Woche zurück aus Berlin! Wieder durfte ich in unserer Landeshauptstadt eine Ehrung entgegennehmen. Zusammen mit meinem langjährigen Mannschaftskameraden Miroslav Klose wurde ich mit dem BAMBI ausgezeichnet. 

Wie ich gestern Abend schon gesagt habe, habe ich diesen besonderen Preis als Fußball-Fan entgegengenommen - stellvertretend für euch alle, die mit uns mitgefiebert haben, uns in Brasilien, in Deutschland oder anderswo auf der Welt angefeuert haben und so aus einem Turnier ein einzigartiges, rauschendes Fußball-Fest gemacht haben. 

Diese Freude, diese Begeisterung und dieser Zusammenhalt waren definitiv BAMBI-würdig!, Und für die Lesefaulen unter euch, hier noch einmal als Bildergeschichte. Ich widme mich jetzt meiner Geburtstagstorte :), Das WM-Jahr nähert sich langsam seinem Ende. Während man zu Beginn der Saison den Einfluss der kurzen Sommerpause noch etwas gespürt hat, haben wir dann sehr schnell in unsere alte Form zurückgefunden. Mit dem Zwischenstand zur aktuellen Länderspielpause in Bundesliga, Pokal und Champions League können wir mehr als zufrieden sein. 

Deshalb stand der gestrige Tag noch einmal ganz im Zeichen der Nationalmannschaft und unseres Erfolges in Brasilien. Am frühen Nachmittag wurden wir von Bundespräsident Joachim Gauck für den Gewinn des WM-Titels mit dem Silbernen Lorbeerblatt ausgezeichnet. Eine besondere Ehre und ein Wiedersehen mit unserer (Fußball-)Kanzlerin Angela Merkel, die es sich nicht hat nehmen lassen uns allen noch einmal persönlich zu gratulieren.

Es folgte die offizielle Verleihung des Weltmeister-Badge durch den FIFA-Präsidenten Joseph Blatter und am Abend die Premiere des WM-Films „Die Mannschaft“. Einen Vorgeschmack für euch gibt es hier:, Danke an alle für 10 Jahre Nationalmannschaft und den schönen Abschiedsabend !

Es war eine großartige Zeit mit vielen besonderen Momenten und einem traumhaften Ende in Brasilien.  

Wer durch die Bilder gestern noch einmal Lust auf WM bekommen hat, dem kann ich das Magazin 54749014 empfehlen. Ich finde es ist eine schöne Sammlung der besonderen Augenblicke des Turniers geworden. Die Autoren sind quasi wir Spieler - da ist auch mal ein bisschen Werbung erlaubt :) 

www.54749014.de, Ein herzliches Dankeschön an Jürgen Graalmann (Vorstandsvorsitzender des AOK-Bundesverbandes) für die Nominierung zur #ALSIceBucketChallange . Starker Einsatz meines Stiftungspartners! Ich bin mir allerdings nicht ganz sicher, ob es als Vorsitzender der AOK GESUNDHEITSkasse zu verantworten ist, andere Menschen dazu aufzufordern sich bei unseren herbstlichen Temperaturen Eiswasser über den Kopf zu schütten…deshalb werde ich auch auf diesen Teil verzichten. Die Aktion an sich unterstütze ich selbstverständlich gerne mit einer Spende und rufe hiermit alle meine Facebook-Fans auf, die sich noch nicht beteiligt haben: Die Welt braucht sicherlich keine 4 Millionen weiterer Videos, aber mit nur 1€ von jedem von euch kann schon eine Menge im Kampf gegen ALS bewirkt werden. Eine Vorstellung bei der ich doch noch Gänsehaut kriege…

Gefällt mir = Ich bin dabei und habe gespendet!

, Am Wochenende ist der Startschuss für die neue Saison gefallen. Nach dem WM-Sommer und der für viele sehr kurzen Pause und Vorbereitung, ist uns gegen Ende des Spiels doch ein wenig die Luft ausgegangen. Wichtig war, dass wir trotzdem die drei Punkte zum Auftakt geholt haben. Es braucht immer ein paar Spiele bis alle bei 100 Prozent angekommen sind, das ist normal. Ich denke, es war ein emotionales Spiel, das Lust auf die neue Saison gemacht hat und auf dem sich aufbauen lässt.

Bevor der Fokus aber wieder vollständig auf dem Fußball liegt, möchte ich euch auch in diesem Jahr ein paar Eindrücke von meinen Sommercamps nicht vorenthalten. Heuer konnten drei Stück veranstaltet werden – mein besonderes Dankeschön gilt der José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung, mit der wir nun schon im vierten Jahr ein gemeinsames Camp realisiert haben, und  FTI als neuem und zukünftigem Veranstalter eines eigenen Philipp Lahm Sommercamps! Ich freue mich sehr über die Unterstützung und die gute Zusammenarbeit im Sinne der Kinder! Die strahlenden Gesichter zeigen, wie ich finde, dass sich dieser Einsatz mehr als lohnt… 

www.philipp-lahm-sommercamp.de, Lieber Basti, 
willkommen im Kreis der alten Fußball-Herren! Jetzt steht auch bei dir die 3 vorne dran. Ich möchte dir trotzdem ganz herzlich zu diesem runden Jubiläum gratulieren und weiß, dass ich mir keine Sorgen machen muss, dass du den Anlass nicht gebührend feiern wirst ;) Bestimmt finden wir bald auch die Gelegenheit nochmals zusammen auf dich anzustoßen. Ich denke, das größte Geschenk hast du dir heuer schon selbst gemacht. Im Herbst letztes Jahr haben wir noch darüber gesprochen, dass der WM-Titel zu unserem gemeinsamen 10-jährigen Jubiläum bei der Nationalmannschaft nicht das Schlechteste wäre… Ich bin sehr stolz und glücklich, dass wir dieses große Ziel zusammen erreicht haben! Danke für deinen einzigartigen Einsatz, den unerschütterlichen Blick nach vorne und die gemeinsame Zeit im DFB-Trikot! 
Dein Philipp, Wie angekündigt, habe ich die etwas ruhigeren Tage auch genutzt, um die Ereignisse der letzten Wochen noch einmal Revue passieren zu lassen und auch meine Beweggründe für den Rücktritt als Kapitän nochmals klarer für mich – und alle Interessierten- zu formulieren. Ich bin auf diesen Schritt sehr stolz und es hat mich sehr gefreut, dass meine für viele doch überraschende Entscheidung allgemein so positiv aufgenommen und anerkannt wurde. Ich habe versucht meine Gedanke dazu in der gestrigen ZEIT-Ausgabe zusammenzufassen.

, null, Endlich Zuhause und den Pokal im Gepäck - Besser geht es nicht! Wir hatten eine schöne Zeit in Brasilien und sind überglücklich als Weltmeister nach Hause zu kommen. Der Finalsieg gegen Argentinien war der Abschluss einer grandiosen Leistung der gesamten Mannschaft. 
Nicht nur im Finale, sondern von der ersten Minute gegen Portugal bis zum erlösenden Abpfiff im Finale gegen Argentinien haben alle Spieler Leidenschaft und den unbedingten Willen gezeigt, den vierten Stern für Deutschland zu holen. Wir waren bereit wie nie!

All das wäre natürlich ohne dem Team hinter dem Team nicht möglich gewesen und natürlich auch nicht ohne die großartige Unterstützung unserer wunderbaren Fans - vor Ort in Brasilien, daheim in Deutschland und auch auf der ganzen Welt. Ihr habt immer an uns geglaubt und uns mit eurem großen Zuspruch motiviert, angetrieben und beflügelt – Ihr habt uns getragen. Vielen Dank!!!
Nach dem unglaublichen Empfang in Berlin mit den ganzen Feierlichkeiten und der Rückkehr nach München werde ich nun erst einmal Urlaub mit meiner Familie machen und dabei nochmals in aller Ruhe die ganzen WM-Eindrücke der vergangenen Wochen genießen., Der gestrige Sieg gegen Portugal war natürlich ein sehr schöner WM-Auftakt! 

Die gesamte Mannschaft hat von Anfang bis Ende eine sehr, sehr gute Leistung gezeigt, sodass die Portugiesen ihre Stärken nicht ausspielen konnten. Alle Spieler haben nach hinten gearbeitet und wir konnten trotz der enormen Hitze vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit unser Spiel zeigen. Die Tore sind im richtigen Moment gefallen – ein 4:0 war, denke ich, die passende Antwort auf all die Diskussionen um fehlende Stürmer in unserer Mannschaft. Dreimal Thomas Spezial;) 

Ein schöner Sieg, aber trotzdem nur das erste Spiel. Jetzt heißt es den Zusammenhalt, das Selbstbewusstsein und die Freude aus diesem ersten Auftritt mitnehmen und konzentriert in die Vorbereitung auf das nächste Spiel am Samstag gegen Ghana gehen.

Danke auch an alle Fans für eure Unterstützung und ein extra Dankeschön nach Südafrika in mein Stiftungsprojekt nach Shongi für die besonderen Glückwünsche!, null, Wenn ich eines im Sport gelernt habe, dann, dass alleine der Glaube an den gemeinsamen Erfolg unglaubliches bewirken kann! So denke ich auch über Europa. Die Idee ist gut. Europa ist in meinen Augen eine einmalige Chance, weil ein Team immer stärker ist als ein Einzelkämpfer. Vielfalt heißt mehr Entscheidungen, sicherlich oft auch zunächst mehr Chaos, aber eben auch mehr Möglichkeiten. Als Gemeinschaft kann man Stärken bündeln und Schwächen ausgleichen. Aber diese Gemeinschaft besteht aus Einzelnen. Und jeder Einzelne wird gebraucht, um die großen Ziele zu erreichen und die Idee von einer offenen und gerechten Gemeinschaft für alle zu realisieren. Deshalb wählen gehen, wer noch nicht war! 
, Es ist Zeit für den nächsten Schritt. Wir sind bereit.
#allin or nothing.
, Dieses letzte Spiel am Samstag in Berlin war der beste Abschluss einer Saison, den man sich wünschen kann. Wir haben dabei nicht nur den Pokal und damit das Double gewonnen, sondern wir haben es vor allem auch allen Kritikern der letzten Woche gezeigt, die teils zu recht, teils aber auch zu Unrecht die fehlende Motivation seit der Meisterschaft angemahnt haben. In diesem Finale hat jeder von Beginn bis zur letzten Minute mit vollem Einsatz, mit Leidenschaft und absoluter Überzeugung gespielt. Obwohl es wenige Spiele gibt, in denen es so ärgerlich ist, schon nach einer halben Stunde verletzt ausgewechselt zu werden, hat mir deshalb der Fußballabend selbst von der Bank aus großen Spaß gemacht. 

Und auch beim anschließenden Feiern möchte ich die Mannschaftsleistung loben, denn auch da ging es deutlich in die Verlängerung ;) 

Viele Zeit zur Regeneration bleibt allerdings nicht, denn schon morgen geht es mit der Nationalmannschaft in Südtirol weiter. Ich werde zwei Tage später ins Trainingslager einsteigen, da das gestrige MRT ergeben hat, dass ich einen Kapselriss habe. 

Diese Woche werde ich deshalb pausieren und mit meiner Familie verbringen, um mich dann ab Freitag mit der Mannschaft auf die Mission Brasilien vorzubereiten. 

Wer die Wartezeit bis zum ersten WM-Spiel mit Lesen überbrücken möchte, kann hier mal einen Blick drauf werfen. Ein wirklich interessantes Buch über den Beruf Fußballprofi, in dem neben mir zum Beispiel auch Thomas Müller, Mario Götze oder der Tiger zu Wort kommen ...

, Danke für die beeindruckende Begrüßung in der Allianz Arena gestern! Der Anblick und die gesamte Atmosphäre beim Einlaufen waren definitiv Champions League würdig!

Dass wir uns dafür nicht auf dem Platz revanchieren konnten, war natürlich auch für uns eine große Enttäuschung. Wir hatten uns viel vorgenommen und wollten natürlich ins Finale. 

Wenn es allerdings nach 20 Minuten 0:2 steht – und das gegen eine Mannschaft wie Real Madrid, dann wird es schwierig. Nach zwei Standardsituationen Tore zu kassieren ist besonders bitter und darf eigentlich nicht passieren.

Im Hinspiel haben wir das Spiel viel besser kontrolliert und wenige Chancen zugelassen. Gestern waren wir vor allem in der ersten Hälfte taktisch nicht gut, haben das Spiel zu offen gestaltet. Das andauernde Hin und Her ist nicht unsere Spielweise, sondern das, was Real mag und worin diese Mannschaft überragend ist. 

Ich denke, wir müssen uns alle hinterfragen. Aber gleichzeitig sollten wir nicht vergessen, was wir in der bisherigen Saison und den letzten zwei Jahren geleistet haben. Wir sind bereits im März Meister geworden und wir haben noch ein Finale vor uns. Gestern sind wir im Halbfinale der Champions League ausgeschieden. Das ist sehr, sehr schade, aber kann gegen Real vorkommen. Jetzt heißt es nochmals drei Wochen Konzentration, um in Berlin einen erfolgreichen Saisonabschluss zu finden., Wir wussten, dass Real sehr defensiv spielt und starke Konterspieler hat. Phasenweise ist es uns gut gelungen, ihre Konter zu verhindern, phasenweise auch nicht. Gegen eine Weltklasse Mannschaft wie Real Madrid 90 Minuten so zu spielen, dass sie zu keiner einzigen Chance kommt, wird keiner Mannschaft gelingen. Uns selber hat gestern gleichzeitig die entscheidende Offensivaktion und das ein oder andere Mal auch einfach das Quäntchen Glück vor dem Tor gefehlt. Dass wir gewinnen wollten hat man, denke ich, gesehen, dass wir es besser machen wollten ist auch klar. Die Wunschvorstellung wäre sicher ein anderes Ergebnis gewesen, aber wir haben zu Hause alle Möglichkeiten, mit zwei Toren Unterschied zu gewinnen. Ich bin für das Rückspiel optimistisch. Wir haben schon oft bewiesen, dass wir Spiele drehen können und wir haben in der Allianz Arena die Unterstützung unserer Fans. Es ist noch alles möglich., Bevor es für uns gleich zur Säbener Straße und an die letzten Vorbereitungen für heute Abend geht, hier für euch etwas zur Überbrückung der Wartezeit: Thomas Müller und ich zu Gast im FCB Magazin "Mia san dran":, # MIA SAN MEISTER 

Vielen Dank für eure Unterstützung! 

Ich hoffe, ihr habt genauso gut gefeiert, wie wir. Schritt eins auf dem Weg zur Verteidigung des Triples ist damit geschafft. Heute und morgen ist verdientermaßen trainingsfrei, bevor es am Samstag gegen Hoffenheim und dann nach England gegen ManU geht. Wir freue uns alle sehr - auf die freien Tage und natürlich auch auf das Viertelfinal-Hinspiel ;), Wir haben das Spiel gegen Chile vorgestern gewonnen, aber es hat uns auch deutlich gezeigt, dass noch viel Arbeit vor uns liegt. 

Es war immer die Stärke der deutschen Nationalmannschaft sich innerhalb des Trainingslagers unmittelbar vor der WM aufeinander einzustellen und diese Zeit intensiv zu nutzen, um Abläufe einzustudieren. 

Ich denke - bei aller berechtigten Kritik - liegt es in der Natur der Sache, dass ein Freundschaftsspiel während der laufenden Bundesligasaison und mit nur zwei Tagen Vorbereitung etwas anderes ist, als ein WM-Spiel. Das Spiel hat noch einmal jedem klar gemacht, worauf wir uns in Südamerika gefasst machen müssen. Ich bin sicher, dass am 16. Juni eine deutsche Mannschaft auf dem Feld stehen wird, die um den WM-Titel mitspielen kann.

Bis dahin freue ich mich mit dem FC Bayern auf die bevorstehenden Bundesligaspieltage und das Rückspiel gegen Arsenal kommende Woche in der Allianz Arena – mit dem festen Vorsatz es dieses Mal nicht unnötig spannend zu machen :), Bevor wir am kommenden Samstag in die Rückrunde starten und das WM-Jahr 2014 offiziell beginnt, möchte ich einen letzten Blick zurück auf das Jahr 2013 werfen. Es war mein bisher schönstes Fußball-Jahr, für das ich mich bei allen bedanken möchte, die ihren Teil dazu beigetragen haben! 

Der Gewinn der Klub-WM war der perfekte Abschluss der Tripel-Saison. In der FIFA-Weltauswahl zu stehen sowie in die UEFA-Elf des Jahres gewählt worden zu sein, ist eine besondere Anerkennung und Auszeichnung meiner persönlich Leistung, die mir sehr viel bedeutet. Danke auch hier an alle, die mir ihre Stimme geben haben!

Über den Jahreswechsel habe ich die fußballfreie Zeit mit meiner Frau, meinem Sohn, Familie und Freunden sehr genossen, richtig entspannt und Kraft gesammelt.  

Auch meine Team-Kameraden haben die Pause scheinbar gut genutzt, denn  die Mannschaft hat im Trainingslager sehr gut und hochmotiviert gearbeitet.  Entsprechend freue ich mich auf die bevorstehenden Spiele: In der Bundesliga muss nach der Hinrunde klar der Meistertitel unser Ziel sein, im Pokal wartet der HSV auf uns und in der Champions League treffen wir wie im letzten Jahr auf Arsenal. 

Bis es tatsächlich los geht, hier noch ein paar Bilder:, Die WM-Qualifikation ist abgeschlossen, morgen um 17 Uhr werden die Gruppen ausgelost. Die Vorbereitungen beim DFB laufen deshalb schon auf Hochtouren. Beim Dreh einer Kampagne haben wir uns auch in der Landessprache schon mal versucht- eher mit mäßigem Erfolg, aber mit viel Spaß, wie ihr im Making-Of-Video sehen könnt…, Nach unserer Rückkehr aus Moskau war ich gestern gleich beim Arzt. Wie ihr sicherlich schon aus anderen Quellen erfahren habt, haben die Untersuchungen ergeben, dass ich mir eine Zerrung in meinem hinteren rechten Oberschenkel zugezogen habe. Heute hieß es deshalb Behandlung statt Training für mich. Einen langen Ausfall fürchte ich aber nicht. Am Samstag gegen Braunschweig werde ich mich sicherlich nochmal mit der Zuschauerrolle begnügen müssen und auch im Pokalspiel gegen Augsburg noch nicht auf dem Platz stehen. Trotz der Tatsache, dass ich auch die Partie gegen Moskau in der zweiten Hälfte nur noch von außen verfolgen konnte, freue ich mich aber über unseren Sieg und den weiteren Rekord, den wir mit dem zehnten Champions-League-Sieg in Serie aufgestellt haben. Es war unter den gegebenen Umständen eine sehr gute Leistung der gesamten Mannschaft. Gruß, Philipp, null, Vielen Dank für die zahlreichen Glückwünsche zu meinem Geburtstag, die mich auf so vielen verschiedenen Wegen erreicht haben! Ich habe mich sehr darüber gefreut und möchte mich hiermit bei jedem Gratulanten herzlich bedanken. Die ganze Nationalmannschaft hat sich am Montag in München versammelt, um mit mir meinen 30sten zu feiern! Ok, zugegebenermaßen war nicht mein Geburtstag der eigentliche Grund, aber es war doch eine schöne Überschneidung und ein gelungener Einstieg in die letzte Länderspielphase in diesem Jahr. Die Fußballweltmeisterschaft rückt immer näher. Die beiden Testspielen gegen Italien und England in dieser und der kommenden Woche werden sicherlich ein erster Gradmesser, wo wir momentan stehen. Auch ihr könnt die Vorbereitung nutzen und euch schon einmal virtuell auf die WM einstimmen, mit dieser spektakulären Laola-Welle wurde letzte Woche unser neues Trikot enthüllt. Gruß von der Säbener Straße!, Seit Ende August ist viel passiert: Wir haben die ersten drei Spiele in der Gruppenphase der Champions League erfolgreich hinter uns gebracht, mit der Nationalmannschaft die WM-Quali geschafft und stehen in der Bundesliga nach dem 10. Spieltag an der Tabellenspitze. 
Diese Woche ist seitdem die erste ohne Länder-, Pokal- oder Champions League-Spiel. Eine kurze Verschnaufpause, bevor wir die zweite Hälfte der Vorrunde in Angriff nehmen. Wer sich in dieser kleinen Fußballpause mal mit einem anderen Thema beschäftigen will, kann auf den folgenden 
Link klicken.  Ein sehr interessantes Gespräch mit Margot Käßmann, indem wir doch erstaunlich viele Gemeinsamkeiten von Fußball und Kirche entdeckt haben: http://chrismon.evangelisch.de/artikel/2013/viele-gaben-ein-geist-19957, Ich denke mit der Champions League Auslosung können wir zufrieden sein. Es gibt sicherlich schwerere Gruppen als unsere. Nach der tollen Saison im letzten Jahr dürfen wir nun heute in Prag beim Supercup ran. Das Spiel gegen Chelsea wollen wir natürlich unbedingt gewinnen. Ich erwarte eine hart umkämpfte Partie. Mit dabei ist dann auch unser neuer „Europas Fußballer des Jahres“. Glückwunsch Franck! Die Auszeichnung hast Du verdient! Bis bald. Philipp, Der Sieg in Frankfurt war ein hartes Stück Arbeit. Es ist klar, dass wir uns in den nächsten Wochen noch steigern müssen. Aber wichtig ist, dass wir erfolgreich in die Saison gestartet sind. Auch wenn die Konzentration und der Fokus auf den nächsten Aufgaben liegen, ist heute Abend ein wenig Ablenkung erlaubt. Ich mache mich langsam fertig für die Premiere des Kinofilms „WEMBLEY – FOOTBALL IS COMING HOAM“ in München, der unseren Weg zum Champions League Triumph dokumentiert. Ich bin gespannt darauf alles noch einmal aus der Beobachterperspektive zu erleben und freue mich auf den Abend! Euer Philipp, Gestern war es endlich soweit: Der Henkelpott ist in München angekommen! Auch heute fehlen mir noch die Worte, um meine Gefühle in dem Moment zu beschreiben, als das Spiel am Samstag in Wembley abgepfiffen wurde. Es ist ein absoluter Traum, auf den wir viele Jahre hingearbeitet haben und dem wir schon zweimal zum Greifen nahe waren. In einem Finale in dem uns Dortmund alles abverlangt hat, haben wir nun endlich den Titel erkämpft. Ich bin überglücklich, dass wir trotz des enormen Drucks, den alle gespürt haben, uns, den Trainer und alle die einen Anteil an diesem Erfolg haben am Ende mit dem Pokal belohnen konnten. Ein riesen Dankeschön auch an alle Fans, die uns in London und vor den Fernsehern unterstützt haben! 

Nachdem wir uns heute vom Spiel - und natürlich der anschließenden Feier ;) - erholen durften, geht es die nächsten vier Tage noch einmal auf den Trainingsplatz. Am kommenden Wochenende wollen wir das Triple perfekt machen!, null, null, Heute ist, denke ich, mit einem Wort und einem Bild alles gesagt: FINALE!, Es war wirklich ein hochemotionales Spiel gestern, in dem wir uns mit dem 4:0-Sieg eine hervorragende Ausgangsposition für das Rückspiel verschafft haben. Wir haben in der Defensive sehr gut gespielt und kaum Chancen zugelassen. Das war der Schlüssel zum Erfolg. Vor dem gegnerischen Publikum in Barcelona müssen wir nun genauso entschlossen und konzentriert auftreten. Die Stimmung und Atmosphäre in der Arena gestern werden die spanischen Fans aber ohnehin nicht überbieten können. Vielen Dank an euch alle für die Wahnsinnsunterstützung! Ich wünsche euch auch heute noch einmal einen spannenden Fußball-Abend und werde dieses mal, wie ihr, die Geschehnisse als Zuschauer verfolgen! Philipp, Der Sieg gegen Juventus am Dienstag war ein wichtiger erster Schritt ins Halbfinale der Champions League. Aber Juve ist eine Spitzenmannschaft und da gilt es im Rückspiel nächste Woche noch einmal dieselbe Leistung abzurufen. Bevor es soweit ist, liegt die volle Konzentration jedoch auf dem morgigen Spiel gegen Frankfurt. Dort können wir mit einem Sieg endlich die Meisterschaft zurück nach München holen! Ich freu mich drauf :) 
Gruß Philipp, Fanclub-Besuch Bayernfreunde Tegernseer Tal, Gestern waren wir Spieler bei unseren Fanclubs. Ich war in Gmund am Tegernsee. Es war ein sehr netter Nachmittag. Hier für Euch ein Panoramabild, das von der Bühne aus gemacht wurde. Später lade ich noch ein paar weitere Bilder von gestern hoch. Gruß Philipp, null, Nach dem tollen Abend gestern habe ich es mir eben auf der Massagebank gemütlich gemacht und mich ein wenig durchkneten lassen. Lange Zeit zum Durchschnaufen bleibt aber natürlich nicht. Am Samstag kommt das Überraschungsteam Frankfurt in die Arena und wir wollen den nächsten Dreier holen. Gruß Philipp, Viele von euch haben es ja schon mitbekommen, meine Frau und ich sind stolze Eltern eines Sohnes. Für alle Glückwünsche hier möchte ich mich herzlich bedanken. Dem kleinen Julian und der Mama geht es gut. Wir sind sehr glücklich. Ich wünsche euch noch ein schönes Wochenende. Gruß Philipp, Ich verfolge natürlich auch die Olympischen Spiele. So viele, abwechslungsreiche und spannende Wettkämpfe in kurzer Zeit zu sehen, ist wirklich faszinierend. Ein Highlight war für mich unter anderem das Finale im Bachvolleyball gestern. An Spannung und Dramatik kaum mehr zu übertreffen. Gratulation an Julius Brink und Jonas Reckermann! Euch allen ein schönes Wochenende und bis bald! Philipp, Vor dem Training nahm ich mir heute Zeit, um mein Sommercamp zu besuchen. Das zweite Jahr in Folge gibt es das Sommercamp auch für junge Leukämiepatienten. Mein Dank gilt der José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung für ihre Unterstützung. Gemeinsam haben wir die Möglichkeit, Mädchen und Jungen bei der Bewältigung ihrer Erkrankung zu helfen und einen Beitrag zur Wiederaufnahme eines gesunden Lebens zu leisten. Zu sehen, mit welcher Begeisterung und Freude die Kinder die gestellten Aufgaben in den einzelnen Workshops bewältigten, war beeindruckend und machte mich sehr glücklich. Gruß Philipp

(Bild: babiradpicture), Nach längerer Pause melde ich mich heute mal wieder bei euch. Bin gerade in Kaiserslautern im Hotel und gleich geht es ins Stadion zum Freundschaftsspiel gegen den FCK. Gestern beim Paulaner-Cup haben wir 15:0 gewonnen. Heute werden wir dagegen richtig gefordert sein. Das Spiel ist ein erster Gradmesser. Gruß Philipp, Die Vorfreude auf das Halbfinale gegen Italien ist riesig. Wir sind gut drauf und die Stimmung in der Truppe ist ausgezeichnet. Das ganze Team ist heiß auf das Spiel. Wir hoffen natürlich auch wieder auf so eine sensationelle Unterstützung der Fans wie zuletzt. Jetzt geht's zum Abendessen und dann schauen wir noch Portugal gegen Spanien. Ich freue mich auf einen schönen Fußballabend. Was meint ihr wer sich durchsetzt? Gruß aus Warschau und bis bald. Philipp, Mit dem Einzug ins Viertelfinale haben wir unser erstes Zwischenziel erreicht. Nun geht es am Freitag gegen Griechenland. Bis dahin können wir uns ausreichend regenerieren und die Aufgabe dann mit höchster Konzentration und Entschlossenheit angehen. Mit welcher Begeisterung zu Hause unsere Spiele verfolgt werden, macht uns sehr stolz und glücklich. Unsere Fans hier vor Ort sorgen dafür, dass wir bislang drei gefühlte Heimspiele hatten. Vielen Dank für die tolle Unterstützung! Philipp, Nach dem verlorenen Champions-League-Finale fällt es mir immer noch schwer, die richtigen Worte zu finden. Ich habe in der Nacht kaum geschlafen und am nächsten Tag versucht, zumindest ein wenig auf andere Gedanken zu kommen. Die Mannschaft hat gut gespielt. Wir waren die komplette Partie die spielbestimmende Mannschaft, aber haben unsere Überlegenheit nicht in Zählbares umgesetzt. Bei den Fans möchte ich mich für die sensationelle Unterstützung bedanken! Es war wirklich ein „Finale dahoam“. Umso bitterer, dass wir es nicht geschafft haben. Die Mannschaft ist in einem guten Alter und wir haben Qualität. Nun gilt es in der nächsten Saison wieder anzugreifen. Philipp, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, Wir wollten die Saison in Köln mit einem Sieg beenden und das ist uns mit dem 4:1 auch gelungen. Für Köln war es natürlich ein sehr trauriger Tag. Aber was nach dem Spiel von einigen Chaoten veranstaltet wurde, hat nichts mit Fußball zu tun. Es ist völlig unverantwortlich, denn sie gefährden damit die Sicherheit aller im Stadion. Nun stehen noch zwei große Aufgaben an. Diese Woche gilt unsere volle Aufmerksamkeit dem Endspiel im DFB-Pokal. Die ganze Mannschaft ist heiß auf das Finale gegen den BVB und will den Titel. Die Atmosphäre in Berlin ist immer etwas Besonderes und ich hoffe, dass uns unsere Fans dort wieder so überragend unterstützen. Anbei noch ein paar Bilder von letzter Woche. Im Rahmen der Aktion „Tore für Afrika“ hat eine bayrische Fußballmannschaft ein Training mit mir gewonnen. Es war eine  schöne und kurzweilige Trainingseinheit mit dem Nachwuchs des SV 1963 Unterneukirchen e.V. Wünsche Euch eine schöne Woche! Philipp, Erstmal möchte ich dem BVB an dieser Stelle zur Titelverteidigung
gratulieren. Die Dortmunder haben aufgrund ihrer Leistungen in der Liga verdient die Meisterschaft gewonnen. Aber auch wir haben noch die Chance auf eine ganz besondere Saison. Dafür müssen wir im Rückspiel gegen Real alles geben. Es wird eine verdammt schwere Aufgabe, aber wir sind nach Madrid gefahren, um uns für das Champions League-Finale zu qualifizieren. Wir werden alles für einen erfolgreichen Fußballabend aus bayerischer Sicht geben! Gruß Philipp, null, Servus zusammen! Mit einem guten Ergebnis im Gepäck sind wir aus Marseille zurück. Morgen geht es gegen den Club. Es sind immer heiße Spiele in Nürnberg. Auch dort wollen wir natürlich wieder drei Punkte mit nach Hause nehmen. Jetzt schaue ich dann, ob eine Kartenrunde zusammengeht oder eher das Freitagabendspiel verfolgt wird. Gruß Philipp, Wie ihr sicher mitbekommen habt, bin ich nicht bei der Nationalmannschaft. Meine Schleimbeutelentzündung im Knie wurde mit Spritzen behandelt. Heute absolvierte ich am Vormittag am Trainingsgelände an der Säbener Straße ein Lauftraining. Für das Wochenende sieht es gut aus. Aber das Spiel gegen Frankreich kommt leider zu früh. Ich werde die Partie am Fernseher verfolgen und freue mich auf ein gutes Match der Jungs. Morgen geht's mit der Mannschaft nach Köln. Dort bereiten wir uns auf Leverkusen vor. Grüße, Philipp!, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, Das Team meiner Stiftung war vergangene Woche in Südafrika und hat sich vor Ort ein Bild von unseren geförderten Projekten gemacht. Mir wurde ausführlich berichtet. Es  ist schön zu hören und zu sehen,  dass die Unterstützung dort ankommt und mit Begeisterung angenommen wird. Um ein paar Eindrücke zu bekommen lade ich noch ein paar Bilder hoch. Mein großer Dank gilt all denjenigen, die sich täglich für diese Projekte engagieren. Philipp, Das war ein verdammt wichtiger Sieg gestern, in meinen Augen eine sehr gute, geschlossene Mannschaftsleistung. Bitter für uns, dass Basti nun wieder ausfällt. Gute Besserung an ihn! Wir hoffen alle, dass er bald zurück kommt. Samstag wird ausgelost. Ich habe keinen Wunschgegner. Und Ihr? Philipp, Nach einer guten, aber brutal kalten Trainingswoche geht es nun nach Hamburg. Für uns ist  es wichtig, nach dem Erfolg in der Vorwoche dort nachzulegen. Euch allen schon mal ein schönes Wochenende! Gruß, Philipp, In ein paar Stunden ist es wieder so weit. Die Anspannung, das Kribbeln und die Vorfreude sind schon da. Einfach schön, dass es heute wieder losgeht. Mit Gladbach erwartet uns ein guter Gegner. Aber eins ist klar, den Platz wollen wir als Sieger verlassen. Grüße, Philipp, Wir hatten ein sehr gutes und auch abwechslungsreiches Trainingslager. In der Freizeit war ich unter anderem in Doha beim Tennis ATP-Turnier. Leider hat Roger Federer verletzungsbedingt absagen müssen. Ich sah dann die Partie Nadal vs. Monfils. Für mich als Hobbyspieler war es beeindruckend. Vielleicht haben vor Weihnachten ein paar von Euch den Fernsehspot mit meinem Partner CEWE Color gesehen. Das Video zeigt Euch einen Blick hinter den Kulissen. So könnt ihr mal sehen, wie so ein Drehtag für mich aussieht. Es hat viel Spaß gemacht! Ich wünsche Euch noch ein schönes und erholsames Wochenende. Philipp, null, Als Sportler verfolge ich natürlich die Wahl zum "Sportler des Jahres". Gratulation an Dirk Nowitzki und Magdalena Neuner! Zwei unglaublich erfolgreiche und sympathische Sportler. Letztes Jahr durfte ich noch stellvertretend für für die Nationalmannschaft den Preis für die "Mannschaft des Jahres" entgegennehmen. Dieses Jahr wurde der BVB geehrt - Glückwunsch! Jetzt geht's nach Essen ins Mannschaftshotel. Morgen spielen wir gegen den VfL Bochum. Es zählt nur ein Sieg! Bis bald, Philipp, Wir treffen in der CL auf den FC Basel. Das ist ein gutes Los. Unser Ziel ist klar, wir wollen weiterkommen! Heute gilt es für uns die Vorrunde mit einem Sieg erfolgreich abzuschließen. Ich freue mich auf die Partie. Grüße, Philipp, null, Vielen Dank an den Fanclub Möckenlohe, der 1200 € an meine Stiftung gespendet hat., null, null, Ein tolles Wochenende liegt hinter mir! Wir haben die Tabellenführung zurückerobert. Die Stimmung beim Fanclubbesuch in Möckenlohe war dementsprechend am Sonntag natürlich hervorragend! Morgen fliegen wir nach Manchester. Um 8:45 Uhr geht’s los zum Flughafen. Das heißt früh aufstehen :-)). Euer Philipp, Gestern habe ich ganz gemütlich daheim auf dem Sofa unser Spiel gegen die Niederländer geschaut. Und ich war begeistert vom Spiel. Tolle Kombinationen, herrliche Tore, unsere Offensive war absolut top. Es hat richtig Spaß gemacht zuzuschauen. Ich denke wir haben verdient in der Höhe gewonnen und einen tollen Jahresabschluss gehabt. Wenn wir da im neuen Jahr anknüpfen und noch etwas zulegen, dann sind die Chancen auf den EM-Titel groß., null, Ich möchte heute an einen ganz besonderen Menschen erinnern, denn der 10. November 2011 ist der 2. Todestag von Robert Enke. Das Schicksal von Robert, seine Depressionserkrankung und der Selbstmord haben damals die ganze Nation bewegt. Seine Frau Teresa hat daraufhin zusammen mit dem DFB, der DFL und Hannover 96 die Robert-Enke-Stiftung gegründet. Ein Ziel der Stiftung ist die Enttabuisierung der Thematik Depression, um so einen offenen Umgang mit psychischen Erkrankungen zu schaffen. Viele Beispiele in jüngster Vergangenheit, gerade aus dem Profisport, zeigen, wie wichtig es ist, frühzeitig Hilfe anzunehmen. Falls Ihr mehr über Robert und die Arbeit der Stiftung erfahren möchtet, so könnt Ihr das hier tun:, Ich hab grad die Bilder der letzten Tage auf meinem iPhone durchgeschaut. Einen Schnappschuss vom STS-Konzert in München wollte ich euch nicht vorenthalten. Es soll die Abschiedstour der Band sein. Als großer STS-Fan wollte ich mir das Konzert natürlich nicht entgehen lassen :-)! Schönen Abend! Philipp, Nach unserem Sieg in Augsburg habe ich nun erstmal frei. Der Bundestrainer hat mich ja nicht für die anstehenden Länderspiele nominiert. Ich bin immer sehr gerne bei der Nationalmannschaft, aber so kann ich nach den vielen englischen Wochen auch die Tage für eine Erholungspause nutzen :-). Da ich eh gerade etwas Probleme mit meinen Nebenhöhlen habe, kann ich die Entzündung in aller Ruhe auskurieren. Die Spiele gegen die Ukraine und Holland schaue ich mir natürlich am Fernseher an und drücke den Jungs die Daumen! Viele Grüße, Philipp, Dem Ziel, unsere Gruppe in der CL zu gewinnen, sind wir gestern wieder einen Schritt näher gekommen. In der ersten Halbzeit haben wir in meinen Augen phasenweise wirklich tollen Fußball gespielt. Nach der Pause hätten wir es natürlich nicht mehr so spannend machen dürfen - das steht außer Frage. Ein großer Wehrmutstropfen ist auch die Verletzung von Basti. Ich hoffe, dass er bald wieder bei der Mannschaft ist und wünsche ihm eine schnell Genesung! Grüße, Philipp, Die Signierstunde heute war toll. Es waren viele Leute da. So auch der ältere Herr auf dem Bild, der extra für seinen Enkel angestanden ist. Rupert, du hast wirklich einen netten Opa ;-)!, Wir sind zurück aus Neapel. Ich denke mit dem 1:1 können wir leben. Die Chancen auf den Sieg waren sicherlich da, aber unter dem Strich ist das Ergebnis gerecht. Am Donnerstag gibt uns der Trainer frei. Ich selber bin morgen bei Hugendubel am Stachus in München. Dort hab ich eine Signierstunde für mein Buch. Heute Abend schau ich was die Konkurrenz in der CL macht. Grüße, Philipp, Es war ein schöner Abschluss gestern mit der Nationalmannschaft. Ich bin stolz, Teil dieser Mannschaft zu sein, die alle zehn Spiele in der EM-Quali gewonnen hat. Aber die EM wird natürlich eine andere Hausnummer. Eine große Mannschaft sollte auch Titel gewinnen. Die Quali hat gezeigt, dass kein Weg an Spanien und Holland vorbeiführen wird! Auch mit Italien rechne ich. Ich freue mich jetzt auf einen gemütlichen Abend auf der Couch! Euer Philipp, Ich freue mich auf das Spiel morgen. Volles Stadion, super Stimmung und ein Top-Gegner. Manchester City hat sehr gute Einzelspieler. Es wird ein harter Prüfstein. Die Stimmung bei uns ist nach den letzten Erfolgen natürlich bestens. Wir sind zuversichtlich einen Dreier einzufahren. Gruß, Philipp, Über den grandiosen 7:0-Sieg gegen Freiburg haben wir uns sehr gefreut. Es hat wahnsinnig Spaß gemacht bei der tollen Stimmung. Ich bin raus, weil ich einen Schlag bekommen habe. Am Mittwoch bin ich wieder dabei. Bin grad mit Andi Ottl unterwegs, der nach dem Sieg gegen den BVB heute frei hat und am Tegernsee ist. Suchen uns noch einen gemütlichen Biergarten, um was zu essen. Euch einen schönen Feierabend!, Es waren schöne Tage bei der Nationalmannschaft. Unsere Bilanz in der EM-Quali ist natürlich überragend. Morgen kommt Freiburg zu uns. Es ist klar, für uns zählen nur drei Punkte und damit die Verteidigung der Tabellenführung. Schönen Abend und viele Grüße! Philipp, Ich kann nur sagen, dass es ein nett geschriebenes Buch ist, in dem ich meine bisherige Karriere anhand von Beispielen ruhig und sachlich beschreibe. Bin dankbar über jeden Kommentar. Gruß, Philipp, Ich freue mich über den klaren Sieg in Lautern und auch dass diese Woche bald vorbei ist. Es war ganz schön viel los. Wir haben uns in Zürich für die CL qualifiziert und mit ManCity, Villarreal und Neapel ziemliche Kracher in der Gruppe zugelost bekommen. Und dann hat auch noch mein Buch für enorme Aufregung gesorgt. Wie ich sehe auch hier bei Facebook., Der Sieg gegen Wolfsburg war verdammt wichtig! Heute waren ja die Zeitungen voll mit den Aussagen von Oliver Kahn über den Führungsstil von Basti und mir. Ich kenne Oliver Kahn und habe deswegen überhaupt kein Problem und sehe die Sache gelassen. Ehrlich gesagt, möchte ich mich auch nicht damit beschäftigen, was in irgendwelchen Blogs steht. Meine volle Konzentration und Energie gilt dem Spiel morgen! Wir brauchen einen klaren Sieg!, Zum Spiel gegen Wolfsburg brauche ich nicht viel sagen. Wir müssen gewinnen. Grüße, Philipp, null, null, null, Bevor es mit dem Flieger nach Hannover geht möchte ich noch ganz kurz auf eine tolle Zusammenarbeit aufmerksam machen. Gemeinsam mit der José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung wird diese Woche mein Sommercamp erstmals für ehemalige Leukämiepatienten veranstaltet. Es war beeindruckend, welche Lebensfreude die Kids nach ihrer Krankheit haben. Es freut mich einfach, dass wir den Kindern eine tolle Woche ermöglichen konnten., Der erste Sieg gegen Brasilien seit 18 Jahren! Es war ein gutes Spiel von uns. Beide Mannschaften gingen ein hohes Tempo. Beim Elfmeter war ich mir sicher, dass ich den Ball gespielt habe - die Fernsehbilder sehen unglücklich aus... Jetzt geht's noch zurück nach München. Das ist kein Problem, denn nach Abendspielen schlafe ich eh immer erst sehr spät ein. Es dauert, bis alles verarbeitet ist. Gruß, Philipp, Über den Start bin ich total enttäuscht. Das haben wir uns anders vorgestellt. Jetzt geht es morgen gegen Brasilien. Diese Begegnung ist immer etwas Besonderes. Entsprechend konzentriert und motiviert werden wir die Sache auch angehen. Bis bald. Philipp, In der CL-Quali spielen wir gegen Zürich.  Das ist ein gutes Los. Am Sonntag geht's endlich wieder in der Bundesliga los. Es ist wichtig gleich mit einem Sieg zu starten. Was ist euer Tipp :)?! Euch ein schönes Wochenende! Philipp, Bin heute nach dem Training in mein Sommercamp gefahren und habe die Kinder besucht. Es ist toll die Möglichkeit zu haben den Kids diese Freude zu machen! Hat sehr viel Spaß gemacht!, Puh! Das war ein anstrengender Nachmittag. Drei Stunden Interviews. Zuerst mit der Wochenzeitung "DIE ZEIT" und Moritz Rinke (der Herr im Bild neben mir). Dann der französischen Zeitung l'équipe - aber auf deutsch :). Zu guter Letzt noch ein Radiointerview mit dem HR. Also, die nächste Zeit könnt ihr wieder einiges Lesen oder hören von mir. Den Feierabend habe ich mir glaube ich jetzt verdient :). Grüße, Philipp, Top, eine Runde weiter! Mit dem Spiel bin ich zufrieden. Mal schauen wen wir am Wochenende zugelost bekommen. Endlich zeigt sich der Sommer mal wieder hier in München! Das werde ich heute noch ausnutzen., So, heute wird es ernst. Im Pokal gegen Braunschweig sind wir gefordert. Ich denke, Leverkusen, Bremen, Freiburg und Wolfsburg sind Warnung genug. Wir gehen die Sache hochkonzentriert an und werden von Beginn zeigen, dass wir dieses Jahr nach Berlin wollen! Um 19:00 Uhr geht's ins Stadion. Bis dahin entspanne ich noch etwas auf dem Hotelzimmer. Gruß, Philipp, Gestern beim AUDI Cup hatten wir mit AC Mailand den ersten richtig schweren Gegner in der Vorbereitung. Obwohl Milan sehr defensiv war, hat man die individuelle Klasse immer wieder gesehen. Ich denke es war eine ordentlich Partie. Jetzt im Finale gegen Barca wollen wir natürlich gewinnen. Das wäre doch auch ein überragendes CL-Finale am 19. Mai 2012 oder? Gruß, Philipp, null, Ich bin wieder im Lande. Der Urlaub in Griechenland war überragend. Von da bin ich direkt zu einer Hochzeit von Freunden nach Italien geflogen - sensationelle Feier ;-)! Und gestern war ich noch am Tegernsee beim Baden. Wie immer zu Saisonbeginn habe ich morgen den Medizincheck und dann geht das Training wieder los. Übrigens: Klasse, dass wir die 600.000-Marke geknackt haben! Besten Dank. Philipp, Hallo Zusammen, zurück aus Aserbaidschan. Bevor ich in Urlaub fahre steht noch ein Spiel an! Am Freitag absolviere ich mit dem Team „Philipp&Friends“ ein Benefizspiel gegen eine Auswahl des Bayerischen Fußballverbands. Der Erlös kommt dem Projekt „Tore für Afrika“ zugute. Falls Ihr mich treffen wollt, so könnt Ihr nach Hausham kommen, dort steigt die Partie. Alles Weitere findet Ihr auf der Homepage. Gruß Philipp, Der Sieg in Österreich war wichtig. Manchmal zählt eben nur das Ergebnis. Jetzt gegen Aserbaidschan zählt natürlich wieder nur ein Sieg. Dann sollten wir eigentlich durch sein. Jetzt ruhe ich mich noch ein wenig auf meinem Zimmer aus und dann geht's eh schon ins Stadion. Gruß, Philipp, Gestern haben wir gegen Uruguay, die viele starke Spieler haben, eine sehr ordentliche Partie gezeigt. Am Samstag beim CL-Finale war ich selbst vorm Fernseher. Beeindruckend wie das "System" Barca funktioniert. Selbst für mich als Profi war das ein Genuss! Bis bald, Philipp, Ich lasse es mir gerade gut gehen und bin bis Donnerstag im Kurzurlaub in den bayerischen Alpen. Essen, Wetter und Erholungsfaktor überragend. Freitag geht's zur Nationalmannschaft nach Frankfurt. Dann wird's langsam wieder ernst. Euer Philipp, Hallo zusammen! Sind gut angekommen in St. Petersburg, das ist eine sehr schöne Stadt. Heut Abend geht's gegen Zenit. Ich freu mich auf das letzte Spiel der Saison. Ab Freitag haben wir dann erstmal frei. Grüße, Philipp, Anbei noch eine Info für Euch: Aufgrund unserer Meisterfeier im letzten Jahr musste das Benefizspiel „Tore für Afrika“ verlegt werden. Nun steht der neue Termin fest. Die Veranstaltung findet am 10. Juni statt. Ich kann auf die Unterstützung vieler Bundesligaprofis zählen und trete gegen eine Auswahl des Bayerischen Fußball Verbandes an. Euch noch einen sonnigen Frühlingstag! Viele Grüße, Philipp, Mit dem 8:1-Sieg bei St. Pauli haben wir unser Minimalziel erreicht. Auch wenn wir es aus eigener Kraft nicht mehr schaffen können, schielen wir noch auf den 2. Platz. Gestern war ich bei Blickpunkt Sport. Dort habe ich einige Augsburger Spieler getroffen. Gratulation auch nochmal an dieser Stelle zum Aufstieg. Jetzt gibt es ein bayerisches Derby mehr. Ich würde mich auch über ein richtiges Lokalderby sehr freuen!, Es ist viel passiert bei uns. Louis van Gaal ist nun doch vorzeitig entlassen worden. Jetzt trainiert uns Andries Jonker bis zum Ende der Saison und wir haben alle das gemeinsame Ziel, den dritten Platz zu erreichen. Unter der Woche herrschte im Team eine positive Stimmung. Ich hoffe, dass Basti und Franck am Sonntag mit dabei sind. Es ist aus heutiger Sicht bislang das wichtigste Spiel der Saison. Grüße, Philipp, Das war ein tolles Spiel gegen den HSV. Wir haben endlich wieder richtig guten Fußball gezeigt. Heute Nachmittag habe ich die Frühlingssonne genossen. Jetzt geht es dann ins Hotel. Morgen kommt Inter. Da gibt es nicht viel zu sagen. Champions League, Flutlicht und eine ausverkaufte Allianz-Arena. Das sind tolle Momente. Ich hoffe auf eine sensationelle Stimmung und natürlich geben wir alles, um weiterzukommen., Das war natürlich eine große Enttäuschung gestern! Ein Titel, den wir gewinnen wollten, ist weg. Es war eine große Chance, die wir nicht genutzt haben. National ist die Saison nur noch schwer zu retten. Da braucht man nicht drum herum reden. Alle Kraft und Konzentration gilt nun den zweiten Platz zu erreichen. Danke für Eure Unterstützung! Philipp, Eben habe ich in den Nachrichten den Rücktritt von Verteidigungsminister zu Guttenberg gesehen. Ich denke der Schritt war richtig und verdient Respekt. Er hat in der Vergangenheit einen Fehler gemacht und nun die Konsequenzen daraus gezogen. Das ermöglicht ihm jetzt die Chance auf einen politischen Neuanfang. Ich glaube, dass wir früher oder später wieder von ihm hören werden. Was meint ihr?, Nach dem Erfolg gegen Mailand hatte ich vor dem Spiel gegen Dortmund ein gutes Gefühl. Wir haben im Spielaufbau zu viele Fehler gemacht und so kam die Borussia einfach zu leicht zu Torchancen. Für uns ist es nun enorm wichtig den zweiten Platz zu erreichen. Das ist das Ziel in der Liga. Jetzt konzentrieren wir uns auf Schalke. Der DFB-Pokal ist der Titel, an dem wir im Moment am nächsten dran sind., Toller Sieg in Mailand!! Hat richtig viel Spaß gemacht. Die Partie war denke ich auch für Euch hochinteressant und spannend. Dortmund hat sich das Spiel sicher auch angeschaut. Wir sind gut drauf. Ich geh fest davon aus, dass wir morgen den Abstand zur Tabellenspitze verringern werden! Schöne Grüße, Philipp!, Am Wochenende konnten wir einen überzeugenden Sieg einfahren. Nach der Niederlage in Köln war es auch es nötig. Nun freu ich mich auf die kommenden Wochen. Erst geht’s nach Mainz und dann müssen wir nach Mailand. Nicht nur für Euch etwas besonders auch für uns Spieler sind solche Begegnungen immer großartige Highlights. Wir geben unser Bestes, dass es dieses Saison noch viele solche Highlights gibt! Grüße, Philipp, Sorry, hab mich hier länger nicht mehr gemeldet. Ihr habt sicher einiges mitbekommen. Es war viel los. Wie ihr auf dem Bild seht, war ich heute vor dem Training noch beim Friseur. Damit ich gegen Köln eine gute Figur abgebe :-). Auch mit beim FC Bayern schaut’s zur Zeit gut aus. Die letzten drei Spiele haben wir souverän gewonnen. Gegen die „Geißböcke“ gilt es, die Serie auszubauen. Euch ein schönes WE. Euer Philipp, Über Silvester war ich mit meiner Frau und einigen Freunden beim Skifahren im Ötztal. Hat richtig Spaß gemacht. Auch das Essen auf den Hütten ist immer was Besonders. Kaiserschmarrn und andere Spezialitäten gehören einfach dazu. Danach ging’s gleich weiter nach Katar ins Trainingslager. Wir hatten top Bedingungen und konnten super trainieren. Ich freu mich, dass es wieder losgeht. Wir haben uns einiges vorgenommen., Sag etwas über dieses Video ..., null, null, Das war ein sehr wichtiger Sieg gestern. Nach dem Spiel ging es gleich weiter nach Baden Baden zur der Sendung „Sportler des Jahres“. Die Ehrung der Mannschaft hat mich natürlich sehr gefreut. Jetzt läuft die Vorbereitung auf das DFB-Pokal-Spiel. Die Karten werden wieder neu gemischt, aber das Ziel bleibt das gleiche: Auch übermorgen wollen wir wieder als Sieger vom Platz gehen. Anbei noch Bilder für Euch. Philipp, Ich hoffe ihr könnt den Winter schon ein wenig genießen, auch wenn der Weg in die Arbeit ein bisschen länger dauert als sonst. Für uns stehen jetzt noch zwei richtungsweisende Spiele an. Stuttgart steht mit dem Rücken zur Wand. Solche Gegner sind immer gefährlich. Wir sind auf alle Fälle gut vorbereitet. Für Euch noch ein paar Bilder und ein Video von einem Fotoshooting das ich diese Woche hatte. Viel Spaß!, null, null, null, null, null, Das Ergebnis auf Schalke ist natürlich deprimierend und war ein Rückschlag. Vor allem, weil wir nicht schlecht gespielt haben. Besonders in der 1. Halbzeit haben wir viele Chancen herausgespielt. Aber wenn wir die Tore nicht machen, stehen wir am Ende mit leeren Händen da. Das ist Fußball. Von der Meisterschaft brauchen wir jetzt erst mal nicht mehr reden. Wichtig ist es, jetzt die Spiele vor Weihnachten zu gewinnen., Ich mach mich jetzt dann gleich auf den Weg in die Olympiahalle, zur Jahreshauptversammlung des FC Bayern. Auch wenn wir in der Liga noch nicht da sind, wo wir hinwollen, gehe ich davon, dass die Fans nach der tollen letzten Saison herzlich empfangen werden :-)... Morgen dann mehr dazu. Schönen Abend, Philipp!, Außerdem unterstütze ich noch die Organisation ONE, die aktuell in einer breit angelegten Kampagne bis 2015 ein Ende der HIV-Übertragung in der Schwangerschaft von Mutter zu Kind fordern. Anbei noch der Link zum Video der Kampagne., Morgen, am 01. Dezember ist wieder Welt-Aids-Tag. In den vergangen drei Jahren war ich Botschafter dafür und auch mit meiner Stiftung engagiere ich mich im Kampf gegen Aids. Ich mache das, weil ich es für eine wichtige Sache halte und als prominenter Sportler in der Öffentlichkeit die nötige Aufmerksamkeit bekomme. Diesmal steht der Welt-Aids-Tag unter dem Motto: „Positiv zusammen leben. Aber sicher.“, null, Herzlichen Dank für die vielen Glückwünsche zu meinem Geburtstag. Ich habe gesehen, dass ich von Euch sogar einen Kuchen bekommen habe! Gestern Abend habe ich mit meiner Familie im kleinen Kreis gefeiert. Heute hat mir auch noch ein kleiner Fan, der Felix gratuliert, wie Ihr auf dem Bild sehen könnt. Sonntag geht’s gegen den Club. Da werden wir keine Geschenke verteilen. Grüße, Philipp!, Heute ist ja zu lesen, dass ich meinen Vertrag bei Bayern verlängert habe. Dazu kann ich sagen, dass die Entwicklung der Mannschaft unter Louis van Gaal sehr positiv ist. Ich glaube, dass wir noch viel erreichen können. Ich habe mich mit dem Vorstand mündlich auf eine Vertragsverlängerung geeinigt und die Unterschrift wird bestimmt noch folgen. Ich freue mich auf die nächsten Jahre mit dem FC Bayern! Grüße, Philipp!, Lange nichts mehr hören lassen... Aber ich war immer viel unterwegs. Die letzten zwei Spiele waren vom Ergebnis in Ordnung. In der CL brauchen wir noch einen Sieg, dann sind wir durch. Spielerisch müssen wir uns die nächsten Wochen steigern. Dann können wir auch in der Bundesliga wieder nach oben schauen. Grüße an Euch alle! Philipp, Bevor es am Abend ins Mannschaftshotel geht, genieß ich jetzt dann noch die Herbstsonne. Der Auswärtssieg in Hoffenheim war sehr wichtig. Ich denke er war auch verdient. Ein Wermutstropfen ist natürlich die Verletzung von Franck. Aber morgen gegen Mainz müssen wir trotzdem mit einem Sieg den Rückstand auf die Tabellenspitze verkürzen. Wünsche euch ein schönes Wiesnwochenende! Philipp, Ich komme gerade vom Abendessen. Wir sind schon in Köln. Auswärts mit drei Punkten in die Qauli zu starten war wichtig. Ich denke, dass Belgien in der Gruppe eine gute Rolle spielen wird. Am Dienstag gegen Aserbaidschan gilt es für uns mit einem Sieg nachzulegen. Philipp, Hallo zusammen! Nach der kurzen Vorbereitung war es wichtig, dass wir gleich mit drei Punkten in die Saison gestartet sind. Die Tage haben wir sehr gut trainiert. Gegen Kaiserslautern erwarte ich ein enges Spiel. Aber es ist klar, dass wir uns am Freitag an die Tabellenspitze setzen wollen. Wünsche allen noch eine erfolgreiche Woche! Philipp, null, null, null, null, Claudia und ich sind wieder im Lande und hatten eine schöne Zeit in Griechenland. Ich konnte mich super erholen bei Sonne, Strand und Meer. Bis Montag habe ich noch frei, dann geht’s wieder los beim FC Bayern. Parallel dazu startet auch mein Sommercamp in Hamburg. Jetzt bin ich ja wieder da, dann werde ich mich auch wieder öfters melden. Bis bald! Philipp, Vielen Dank für die zahlreichen Glückwünsche zu meiner Hochzeit. Es war ein tolles Fest und der Tag wird mir immer in Erinnerung bleiben. Bilder habt ihr ja schon viele hochgeladen, da habt ihr mir die Arbeit abgenommen. Ich bin heute Morgen mit meiner Frau Claudia nach Griechenland in die Flitterwochen geflogen. Wir genießen hier erst mal die Ruhe und die Zeit, die wir für einander haben. Sonnige Grüße, Euer Philipp, Ich bin natürlich noch sehr enttäuscht. Schade für die Mannschaft und die Fans, die uns während der WM so phänomenal unterstützt haben, dass es nicht geklappt hat. Das Finale war unser großes Ziel. Aber wir agierten gestern nicht mutig genug. Auch wenn es im Moment noch schwer fällt, wollen wir uns natürlich am Samstag mit einem Sieg verabschieden. Ich bin übrigens gleich bei der Pressekonferenz. Grüße, Philipp!, Morgen ist es endlich so weit. Im Viertelfinale wartet auf uns Argentinien. Das gesamte Trainerteam hat uns optimal vorbereitet. Ich schätze die Argentinier stärker ein als England. Heute ist Brasilien ausgeschieden. Die Brasilianer gehörten für mich zu den Topfavoriten. Das Wetter muss bei euch ja super sein. Ich wünsch euch morgen einen tollen und vor allem erfolgreichen Fußballnachmittag! Euer Philipp, Gestern nach dem Spiel haben wir natürlich noch ein wenig gefeiert, aber nicht zu ausgiebig. Auf meinem Zimmer kann ich ein paar deutsche Sender empfangen. Die Bilder, die ich am Abend aus der Heimat gesehen habe, waren überwältigend! Heute hat uns der Bundestrainer frei gegeben. So hatte ich die Möglichkeit, ein wenig die Gegend zu erkundigen. Auch ein Tischtennis-Match stand auf dem Programm. Bis bald! Philipp, Heute Vormittag machten wir einen Ausflug in einen nahegelegenen Safaripark. Mittags war ich bei der Pressekonferenz. Auf das Achtelfinale freue ich mich riesig!Deutschland gegen England ist ein absoluter Klassiker! Wir sind hungrig auf Erfolge und werden am Sonntag top vorbereitet sein. Ich hoffe die 30-Millionen Marke am TV wird geknackt! Viele Grüße aus Südafrika an Euch alle! Philipp, Ich komme gerade vom Training und gleich geht es zum Mittagessen. Gegen Serbien haben wir nicht schlecht gespielt. Mit einem Mann weniger waren wir über weite Strecken das bessere Team. Für das Spiel gegen Ghana bin ich absolut zuversichtlich und fest davon überzeugt, dass wir gewinnen. Ich hoffe es stehen weiter so viele hinter uns. Über 20 Millionen daheim vorm Fernseher - das ist Wahnsinn. Viele Grüße, Philipp, null, null, null, null, Das war wirklich ein klasse Auftakt gestern. Wir haben richtig gut gespielt. Der Sieg war auch für das Selbstvertrauen wichtig, weil man vor einem Turnier nicht genau weiß, wo man steht. Das Tor von Miro hat mich für ihn persönlich richtig gefreut. Jetzt schaue ich noch ein bisschen Italien gegen Paraguay an. Wünsche Euch noch einen schönen Abend! Viele Grüße aus Südafrika, Philipp, Hallo zusammen aus Südafrika! Bei unserer Ankunft wurden wir schon am Flughafen begeistert empfangen. Die Vorfreude auf die WM ist riesig, das ist überall zu spüren. Die Bedingungen sind hier hervorragend. Am Samstag reisen wir schon nach Durban. Ich wünsch Euch allen morgen ein tolles Eröffnungsspiel. Bis bald. Euer Philipp, Heute habe ich in München die Sonnenstrahlen ein wenig genossen und mir ein Eis gegönnt. Mit dem Spiel gestern können wir zufrieden sein. Wir haben uns viele Torchancen erarbeitet. Für mich persönlich war das Tor natürlich eine super Sache. Ihr seht, auch rechts kann ich in der Offensive Akzente setzen ;). Es freut mich, dass auf der Seite immer mehr los ist. Wünsche Euch allen ein schönes Wochenende! Philipp, Morgen fliegen wir nach Frankfurt. Am Donnerstag haben wir in der Commerzbank- Arena unser letztes Vorbereitungsspiel gegen Bosnien Herzegowina. Ihr hört wieder von mir! Euer Philipp, Ich bin gerade auf meinem Zimmer im Hotel, weil wir Mittagsruhe haben. Gestern hatte sich die Bundeskanzlerin zu einem Besuch angekündigt. Auf Grund des Rücktritts von Horst Köhler musste Angela Merkel den Termin leider absagen. Dafür habe ich natürlich vollstes Verständnis. Es hat mich aber dann sehr gefreut, dass uns die Kanzlerin telefonisch viel Glück und Erfolg für die WM gewünscht hat., Heute habe ich noch viele Autogramme geschrieben, weil es für mich morgen nach Südtirol zur Nationalmannschaft geht. Ich werde sicher auch in Südafrika Zeit finden, mich bei Euch ab und an zu melden. Bei Gelegenheit lade ich an der Stelle auch ein paar Bilder hoch., Servus zusammen! Was soll ich zum Champions League Finale noch groß sagen. Ich war natürlich sehr enttäuscht. Wenn man so weit kommt will man unbedingt den Titel. Die Atmosphäre war einfach Wahnsinn. Ein großes Dankeschön an alle Fans, die uns in Madrid unterstützt bzw. dann am Sonntag am Marienplatz empfangen haben. Nicht auszudenken was los gewesen wäre, wenn wir gewonnen hätten., null, null, Das Finale in Berlin war traumhaft! Wir haben richtig gut Fußball gespielt und absolut verdient gewonnen. Ich habe noch bis spät nachts gefeiert. Alle Konzentration gilt aber jetzt dem Finale in der Champions League. Heute hat die Vorbereitung auf das Spiel gegen Inter begonnen. Anbei noch ein Bild von mir. Ich hoffe nächste Woche folgt noch eines mit dem CL-Pokal. Das wäre der Hammer! Viele Grüße, Philipp!, Die Meisterfeier am Sonntag war wirklich unglaublich. Wahnsinn wie viele Leute auf den Straßen waren. Obwohl es für mich nicht die erste Meisterschaft ist, war es beeindruckend. Ich habe auf dem Rathausbalkon ein paar Eindrücke gefilmt und wollte die gerade hochladen - klappt aber nicht. Auf das Finale am Samstag gegen Bremen freue ich mich schon. Die Atmosphäre in Berlin ist immer etwas Besonderes. Grüße, Philipp!, Für mich geht es jetzt dann zum Training. Gleich anschließend fliegen wir nach Berlin. Das Spiel gegen die Hertha gehen wir genauso konzentriert an, wie jedes andere. Wir haben schließlich in der Saison noch einiges vor… Euer Philipp, Gestern wurde Uli Hoeneß im Schloss Nymphenburg für sein Wirken in der Stiftung “Münchner Courage“ und als Kuratoriumsvorsitzender der “Dominik-Brunner-Stiftung“ ausgezeichnet. Er bekam den Zivilcouragepreis der Stiftung “Bündnis für Kinder. Gegen Gewalt“. Ich hatte die große Ehre, die Laudatio halten zu dürfen., Ein Ersatztermin konnte kurzfristig nicht mehr gefunden werden, da wir noch an zwei Wochenenden im Endspiel stehen und dann die WM vor der Tür steht. Das Spiel wird nachgeholt. Ihr bekommt auf alle Fälle an dieser Stelle Bescheid. Euer Philipp, Für alle, die sich den Termin für die Benefizspiel „Tore für Afrika“ am Sonntag vorgemerkt haben. Das Spiel muss leider abgesagt werden, weil ich terminlich verhindert bin. Ich weiß, dass für die Veranstaltung viele Helfer notwendig sind und möchte mich auf diesem Wege bei alle Beteiligten für ihr Engagement bedanken., Nach dem 3:1-Sieg gegen Bochum und der Bremer Schützenhilfe haben wir in dieser Saison unseren ersten Titel geholt – ich hoffe es war nicht der letzte! Am Abend war ich mit der Mannschaft noch bei einem Griechen in Schwabing beim feiern. Heute hat uns der Trainer frei gegeben. Für mich geht's jetzt dann zum Tanzkurs – für die Hochzeit muss ich schließlich auch bestens vorbereitet sein :-)… Bis bald!, null, Mit dem 1:1 gegen Gladbach müssen wir zufrieden sein. In der 2. Halbzeit haben wir uns viele Torchancen erarbeitet. Körperlich sind wir topfit. Die Meisterschaft liegt immer noch in unserer Hand. Heute Mittag sind wir in Lyon gelandet. Ich bin gerade in meinem Hotelzimmer. In gut einer Stunde geht’s los zum Abschlusstraining im Stade Gerland. Ich habe ein gutes Gefühl für morgen! Viele Grüße aus Frankreich! Philipp, To my international fans: It was an exciting match yesterday. We were well organized on the pitch and played really well. At the end we even had the chance to score one more goal. But all in all it is a good result and we have a realistic chance to reach the final in Madrid., Gegen Lyon hatten wir gestern die gesamte Partie eine gute Ordnung und spielten auch sehr gut. Am Ende hätten wir vielleicht sogar noch ein Tor mehr schießen können. Aber 1:0 ist eine gute Ausgangsposition. Nun haben wir die Chance, das Endspiel in Madrid zu erreichen. Nach dem Training hatte ich noch einige Interview-Termine. Deswegen freue ich mich, wenn ich jetzt dann endlich auf der Couch liege. Bis bald!, null, Gleich geht's zum Trainingsgelände und dann weiter ins Mannschaftshotel. Die zwei freien Tage unter der Woche haben mir sehr gut getan - ich konnte mich wieder richtig erholen. Morgen kommt Hannover in die Allianz-Arena. Vier Spieltage vor Schluss dürfen wir natürlich zu Hause keine Punkte mehr abgeben. Euch allen ein schönes Wochenende! Servus, Philipp, null, null, Die Tabellenspitze haben wir verteidigt! Heute und morgen hat uns der Trainer frei gegeben. Endlich Zeit mich ein wenig zu erholen, auch wenn ich trotzdem viele Termine habe. Gleich geht es zum Bayerischen Staatsministerium. Dort bekomme ich die "Bayerische Staatsmedaille für Verdienste um die Gesundheit" verliehen. Vielleicht gibt es hier auch ein paar Bilder davon. Ich muss los! Bis bald..., At the moment I’m at the hotel in Colone and I’m relaxing. Amazing that we reached the semi-final yesterday - although our performance in the first half wasn’t really good. But we hit back after the break and played well. At least we won on away goals. I think everybody could see, that the team has a great moral. Now we have a realistic chance to reach the final this year. Best regards, Philipp!, Anbei noch der Link zur Seite: Tore für Afrika. Und jetzt freue mich auf das Arsenal-Spiel heute Abend gegen Barca! Bis bald!, null, null, null, Jetzt geht’s dann ins Mannschaftshotel, wie immer vor unseren Heimspielen. Alle Konzentration gilt dem Spiel morgen gegen ManU. Wir müssen morgen defensiv sehr geordnet stehen. Ich freu mich auf die Partie. Ausverkauftes Haus und einen Gegner, der zu den besten Europas gehört – was will man mehr?! Jetzt können wir zeigen, wie weit wir sind! Übrigens war ich heut noch beim Friseur. Morgen seht ihr mich ja dann :)..., null, Jetzt schaff ich es mal wieder mich kurz bei euch zu melden. Die Woche war bei mir viel los. Ich hatte einen kurzen Werbedreh für die WM und ein Fotoshooting. Gestern schaute ich Champions League. Der Sieg von Barca war natürlich hochverdient. Um die zu Hause zu schlagen braucht wirklich jede jede Mannschaft einen klasse Tag. Jetzt bin ich mal auf die Auslosung am Freitag gespannt! Macht’s gut!, Aus Florenz zurück, freu ich mich sehr, dass wir ins Viertelfinale gekommen sind. Haben das natürlich auch gefeiert - in Maßen (nicht Massen) versteht sich :). Denn am Samstag steht ja mit Bayern schon das nächste Spiel auf dem Programm. Der Gegner heißt Freiburg und wir dürfen jetzt nicht den Fehler machen, sie zu unterschätzen. Wer Meister werden will, der muss gerade solche Spiele gewinnen. Und das ist unser Ziel!, Hallo ich  bin jetzt im Mannschaftshotel, über das Argentinien-Spiel brauchen  wir nicht zu reden, das war nichts. Jetzt gilt die Konzentration dem Köln-Spiel. Ziel ist es 3 Punkte zu  holen und die Führung evtl. auszubauen. Daher könnt Ihr auch Andi Ottl  und Nürnberg die Daumen drücken. Ersten, weil der Club  einen Sieg gut gebrauchen kann und zweitens, weil uns jeder Punkt  hilft, den sie Leverkusen abknöpfen :-), Das Spiel gestern Abend war sehr unterhaltsam. Heute geht’s weiter mit Inter gegen Chelsea – auch da werde ich mal reinschauen. Hier wurde ja gepostet, dass Biathlon interessanter ist als Fußball :). Natürlich verfolge auch unsere Sportler in Vancouver aufmerksam. Hab gerade gelesen, dass wir im Medaillenspiegel im Moment zweiter sind. Ich hoffe wir packen die Amerikaner noch :)..., Gestern war ich den ganzen Tag unterwegs. Nach dem Training war ich auf der SpoBis – einem Sportkongress und habe an einer Podiumsdiskussion über mein Sommercamp teilgenommen. Gleich danach war dann noch Kuratoriumssitzung meiner Stiftung. Den freien Tag heute nutze ich, um mich ein wenig auszuruhen. Am Abend schau ich dieses mal wirklich Stuttgart an :). An den neuen Spielplan musste ich mich auch erst gewöhnen., Mit unserer Leistung gestern können wir nicht zufrieden sein. Vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit hatten wir zu viele Ballverluste. Nach der Pause wurde es besser. Dann erspielten wir uns auch mehr Torchancen. Zum Schluss war natürlich auch das nötige Glück auf unserer Seite. Das Tor war klar abseits. In Florenz wird es sicherlich nicht einfach für uns. Aber jetzt geht’s erst mal am Samstag zum Derby nach Nürnberg., Ich komme gerade vom Training. Mit dem Sieg gegen Dortmund haben wir unsere Serie weiter ausgebaut. In den letzten Spielen haben wir in der Defensive zu viel zugelassen. Am Mittwoch kommt Florenz. Hier müssen wir wieder konsequenter verteidigen. Ich freue mich schon auf die Partie. Champions League ist immer etwas besonders. Vor allem die Endrunde. Morgen werde ich mir das Spiel Stuttgart gegen Barcelona anschauen., Berlin, Berlin, wir fahren nach Berlin?! Gestern kamen wir zu Beginn nicht richtig in die Partie. In der zweiten Hälfte machten wir es besser. Unser Sieg war verdient. Vielleicht ist er am Ende etwas zu hoch ausgefallen. Mein Tor freut mich natürlich! Als Außenverteidiger bekomme ich nicht so oft die Möglichkeit selbst abzuschließen. Jetzt geht’s gegen Schalke. Das wird eine heiße Kiste. Philipp, null, Ich bin gestern Abend wieder zu Hause angekommen. Heute Vormittag war ein lockeres Training, danach hatte ich noch einen Sponsorentermin. Der 3:1-Sieg war gestern sicherlich verdient. Wenn wir weiter so Fußball spielen, werden wir die Schale nach München holen. Heute werde ich mich zu Hause von der anstrengenden Woche etwas erholen und den Tag gemütlich vor dem Fernseher ausklingen lassen. Euch einen schönen Abend!, Heute hatte ich gleich nach dem Training ein Fotoshooting für einen Partner, der mein Sommer Camp unterstützt. Es hat mir viel Spaß gemacht. Morgen Nachmittag geht es schon nach Wolfsburg. Es wird denke ich kein leichtes Spiel für uns. Der VfL ist stärker als es die Tabelle sagt, aber wir haben einen super Lauf und ich geh davon aus, dass wir dort gewinnen. Drückt uns die Daumen und bis blad!, Ich glaube zum Spiel gegen Mainz muss ich nicht viel sagen. Der Sieg war hochverdient. So kann es weiter gehen. Gestern hab ich etwas Zeit vorm Fernseher verbracht und mir zum Teil das Finale der Australian Open angeschaut. Ich muss zugeben, die Art und Weise, wie Federer seine Gegner dominiert fasziniert mich. In meiner Freizeit spiele ich auch gerne Tennis. Ich denke, dass ich mir wieder einiges abschauen konnte :), Ich habe gerade die Collage gesehen, die mich gemeinsam mit Claudia zeigt. Vielen Dank! Ihr seid wirklich kreativ. Besonders freut mich, dass die Glückwünsche aus China kommen. Vielleicht versuche ich in Zukunft auch mal in Englisch zu posten, damit auch die internationalen Fans das Geschehen hier verfolgen können. Ich lade gleich noch ein paar Bilder von Südafrika hoch. Viel Spaß und bis bald! Philipp, Ich bin noch bis morgen Abend mit der Nationalmannschaft in Stuttgart. Nach unserem Erfolg gegen Bremen schaute ich gestern was die Konkurrenz machte. Zwar hat Leverkusen durch den Sieg gegen Hoffenheim uns wieder von der Spitze verdrängt, doch ich bin mir sicher, dass am Ende wir ganz vorne sein werden. Bevor es morgen wieder zurück nach München geht, steht für mich noch der Leistungstests an. Ich gebe mein Bestes., Wie ihr gestern wahrscheinlich aus den Medien erfahren habt, werde ich im Sommer nach der Weltmeisterschaft heiraten. Ich kenne Claudia schon sehr lange. Seit rund zwei Jahren sind wir nun ein Paar. Ende des letzten Jahres hab ich ihr ganz klassisch einen Antrag gemacht. Die Glückwünsche hab ich gelesen – vielen Dank! Für mich wird es also sicher ein toller Sommer! Bis bald, null, Zuvor noch ein Bild von meinem Skiurlaub vor Weihnachten in Ischgl. Ich denke den Sportkameraden neben mir kennt Ihr auch alle?! Bis bald! Philipp, Endlich ist es wieder so weit, morgen geht’s los. Heute hatten wir nochmal Training. Am Abend fahr ich mit der Mannschaft ins Hotel zur Vorbereitung auf das Spiel morgen gegen Hoffenheim. Es hat mich riesig gefreut, dass ein paar von Euch gerne Informationen über meine Projekte in Afrika hätten. Kommende Woche lade ich Bilder hoch und gebe Euch ein paar Links, wo sich jeder informieren kann., Ich bin nun wieder zurück in München. Der Anschlag auf das Nationalteam von Togo hat auch mich beschäftigt. Ich denke aber, dass man das Rebellengebiet in Angola nicht mit Südafrika vergleichen sollte. Ich selbst war schon in Südafrika und arbeite dort mit meiner Stiftung auch im Moment an verschiedenen Projekten. Ich kann nur sagen, dass ich mich dort sicher fühle und die Leute dort mein absolutes Vertrauen haben., Anfang der Woche wurde der Burj Kalifa eröffnet. Mit 828 Metern ist es das höchste Gebäude der Welt. Vom Hotel aus hatte ich einen super Blick auf die grandiose Show. Unglaublich was hier in letzter Zeit alles entstanden ist. Nachdem aber auch Dubai nicht von der Krise verschont bleibt, denke ich, dass auch hier erstmal kleinere Brötchen gebacken werden., Wie Ihr wahrscheinlich alle wisst, bereiten wir uns im Moment in Dubai auf die Rückrunde vor.  Die Stimmung in der Mannschaft ist wirklich gut. Wir arbeiten sehr konzentriert. In den Einheiten geht jeder an seine Grenzen. Nach drei Tagen Training merke ich natürlich auch meine Beine, aber das gehört dazu. Am Abend hab ich meistens noch kurz Zeit im Pool ein wenig zu entspannen und die Sonne zu genießen!, null, Weihnachten hab ich gestern gemeinsam mit meiner Familie bei mir zu Hause gefeiert. Es war ein besinnlicher Abend. Vormittag war ich noch mit meinem Papa beim Skifahren. Das hat Tradition. In der Zeit bereiteten die Frauen alles vor. Zum Essen gab es wie jedes Jahr Fondue, da bestehe ich auch drauf :). Heute geht's schon weiter mit den Köstlichkeiten, denn am 25. kocht meine Oma für uns alle immer eine Gans., null, null, Danke für die Geschenkideen. Bevor es so weit ist, fahr ich mit Freunden zum Skifahren. Als ich anlässlich des Weltklimagipfels die Berichte über die Klimaveränderung sah, kam bei mir auch der Gedanke auf, ob das in 20 oder 30 Jahren noch so ohne weiteres möglich sein wird. Im Moment sagt der Schneebericht aber, dass ich mir darüber keine Sorgen machen muss. Deshalb freu mich schon auf die bevorstehenden Tage., Bild: Bernd Feil, Bild: Bernd Feil, Bild: Bernd Feil, Bild: Bernd Feil, Bild: Bernd Feil, Bild: Bernd Feil, Servus zusammen! Ich würd sagen, so kann es weitergehen. In Bochum haben wir wieder richtig gut gespielt. Gestern war ich beim Fanclubbesuch bei den „Red Stars Attenhausen“. Ich denke, dass es für alle ein netter Nachmittag war. Später lade ich noch ein paar Bilder davon hoch. Übrigens habe ich beim Torwandschießen vom Weißbierglas getroffen :-) … Jetzt geht’s in die Stadt, Weihnachtsgeschenke besorgen., Der Sieg in Turin war natürlich super, auch wie er zustande kam. Für uns, war es eine Art Befreiungsschlag. Mit einigen Mitspielern hab ich noch gebührend gefeiert. Und ich kann sagen, dass die Nacht sehr kurz war. Gestern hatten wir noch Training. Dafür kann ich mich heute erholen, der Coach hat uns freigegeben. Ich werde den Tag wohl nutzen, um mir ein paar Gedanken zu machen, was ich zu Weihnachten verschenke., Gestern hab ich mich vorm Fernseher noch etwas ausgeruht, denn heute geht’s ja schon zum Endspiel nach Turin. Um 12 Uhr ist Abflug. Am Abend trainieren wir ein letztes Mal vor dem morgigen Spiel. Nach dem Sieg gegen Gladbach können wir selbstbewusst in die Partie gehen. Drückt uns die Daumen! Ach ja, mein Bild hab ich natürlich geändert – vielen Dank fürs mitmachen. Jetzt muss ich los, nicht dass ich zu spät komme., Ich bin gerade im Mannschaftshotel. Da habe ich immer meinen Laptop dabei. Heute stehen zwei wichtige Ereignisse an. Die WM-Auslosung und das Spiel gegen Gladbach. Ich denke, dass ich die Auslosung während der Fahrt ins Stadion verfolgen kann. Bin gespannt, wie unsere Gruppe aussehen wird. Anschließend heißt es dann natürlich, volle Konzentration auf das Spiel. Nach dem Sieg gegen Hannover müssen wir heute nachlegen!, null, null, null, null, Heute am 1. Dezember ist Welt Aids Tag. Vor zwei Jahren war ich in Südafrika. Bei meinem Besuch sah ich, wie schrecklich es ist, wenn diese Krankheit ein ganzes Land im Griff hat. Als Botschafter versuche ich meinen Teil beizutragen, dass das Thema nicht in Vergessenheit gerät. Heute gilt es, Solidarität zu zeigen. Anbei noch ein kurzes Video. Ihr könnt ja mal reinschauen. Bis bald!, Wie die meisten von euch wissen, bin ich Botschafter des Welt-Aids-Tages. Zusammen mit Anni Friesinger, Samy Deluxe und Christiane Paul mache ich mich für ein Thema stark, das wirklich alle angeht. Aids ist nach wie vor nicht heilbar! Unterstützt uns beim Kampf gegen Aids und werdet selbst Botschafter unter http://www.welt-aids-tag.de/botschafter/werden/index.php, Gestern hat es wieder nicht für einen Sieg gereicht. Im Moment zeigen wir einfach zu wenig, das ist keine Frage. Am Mittwoch geht es in der Champions League gegen Haifa, wo wir versuchen, die letzte Chance aufs Achtelfinale zu wahren. Demnächst gibt es an dieser Stelle auch mal wieder ein paar Bilder oder ein Video von mir. Leider bin ich in letzter Zeit nicht dazugekommen. Bis bald! Philipp, Nachdem wir gestern 2:2 gegen die Elfenbeinküste gespielt haben, musste ich heute Morgen schon früh raus. Anlässlich des RTL-Spendenmarathons war ich Live-Gast in der Sendung Punkt 9. Der Spendenmarathon unterstützt dieses Jahr auch das Philipp Lahm Sommercamp - ein Projekt meiner Stiftung. Also, um 18 Uhr geht`s los, ihr könnt ja mal einschalten. Mehr Infos zum Camp findet ihr hier: www.philipp-lahm-sommercamp.de, Wie Ihr wisst, war ich gestern in Hannover, bei der Trauerfeier von Robert Enke, um ihm die letzte Ehre zu erweisen. Es war eine sehr bewegende Trauerfeier mit ergreifenden Reden. Anschließend reisten wir mit der Nationalmannschaft nach Düsseldorf. Dort bereiten wir uns nun so gut es geht auf das Spiel gegen die Elfenbeinküste vor. Nachher haben wir Training, jetzt ruhe ich mich noch ein bisschen aus. Bis demnächst!, Wie Ihr wisst habe ich heute Geburtstag.  Eigentlich ein Tag zum Feiern, danach ist mir nicht zu Mute. Gestern habe ich mit Robert Enke einen Kollegen und ganz lieben Freund verloren. Wir stehen alle unter Schock und können es einfach nicht begreifen. Seine liebenswerte Art wird mir immer im Gedächtnis bleiben. Meine ganze Anteilnahme gilt seiner Frau und seiner kleinen Tochter. Robert - wir vermissen Dich!, Die Resonanz der vergangenen Tage war überwältigend. Der Zuspruch hat mich sehr gefreut. Auch die Initiative "Philipp Lahm hat Recht!" habe ich gesehen und musste schmunzeln. Vielen Dank! Morgen am 11.11. habe ich Geburtstag und wir sind jetzt mit der Nationalmannschaft im Rheinland, das passt zusammen. Doch vom Karneval werde ich wenig mitbekommen, denn das Spiel gegen Chile hat absolute Priorität. Bis bald! Philipp, Schade, dass wir gegen Schalke nicht gewonnen haben. Aber zu Spitze sind es nur 6 Punkte. Für uns ist somit noch alles drin. Es war ein turbulentes Wochenende für mich. Vielen Dank für die vielen aufbauenden Worte! Heute bin ich nochmal beim FCB, bevor es morgen zu adidas geht. Dort haben wir einen PR-Termin mit dem DFB-Team. Anschließend reisen wir weiter zur Vorbereitung auf die Länderspiele. Bis bald! Euer Philipp, Servus! Heute hat uns der Trainer frei gegeben, damit wir etwas auf andere Gedanken kommen. Ganz frei hatte ich aber nicht - denn ich komme gerade von einem Fotoshooting mit adidas. Das Spiel gegen Bordeaux war leider nichts. Jetzt gegen Schalke müssen wir uns besser präsentieren. Ich hoffe, wenn wir uns das nächste Mal hören, kann ich euch über einen Sieg berichten. Bis bald! Euer Philipp, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null)
