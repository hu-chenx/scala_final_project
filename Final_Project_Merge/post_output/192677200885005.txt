Ask for it next visit., Join Josephine on a Culinary Tour of Italy!

Boston's favorite new French restaurant Josephine is going to Italy.  Josephine took her French culinary skills on a tour through Italy and was inspired to infuse Italian cuisine with her French training.
Two of the greatest cuisines of the world are French and Italian.  While French cuisine is known for delicate taste combinations and fine dining, Italian cooking brings to mind robust hearty home cooked meals and a family atmosphere.  Josephine aspires to both.  Starting this month, Josephine will take its guests on a virtual culinary tour of Italy, bringing the delicious tastes of the North End to Kenmore Square with the surprising spin you've come to expect from Josephine.  Many French favorites will remain on the menu, as well Josephine's warm and comforting atmosphere.  Join us soon and have a great night.
