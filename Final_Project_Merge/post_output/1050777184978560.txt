Thanks to Swissbäkers for the gingerbread men!, Social media—it's everywhere these days!  Twitter this, Instagram that.  Facebook, well, you might be reading this invitation on it!  Tumblr anyone?  Even, sorry to note, ISIS uses it to strong effect (let's hope not for long).

Where and when, however, did social media start?  Oh, Yes, you know I'm going there...it's social by definition, bringing a troupe of people to a neighborhood...it's medium is one of the oldest, song...it has spread across the world...and in the United States it started in our own Boston in 1855...so, Yes, the original social media app is:

Christmas Carolling!

Come help us go viral again this year:

Tuesday, December 15
7:00 p.m. sharp (we leave at 7; plan for 6:45 if you must!)
