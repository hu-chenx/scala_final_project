Today, UNEP released findings from our Emissions Gap report, which looks at the emissions reductions required to limit global temperature rise to 2°C.

We are beginning to bend the curve on emissions. Over 150 countries have submitted their plans (INDCs) to reduce GHG emissions, which represents a great increase in ambition and an unprecedented commitment to tackle this global challenge.

To close the gap to the 2°C target, it is essential that an agreement in Paris adopt a dynamic approach in which ambitions and cooperation can be regularly adjusted upwards in the future. Success in Paris will need to be measured on how we are able to accelerate global action on climate change.

To avoid wasting food and money we must change the way in which we purchase food for consumption. One of the best ways to reduce food is through planning. Planning saves time, cuts stress and stretches your food budget all the while saving you from buying too much food in the first place. This is just one of the ways through which #foodwaste can be stopped.

The international chemicals industry has grown dramatically since the 1970s, when global chemical output was valued at US$171 billion and by 2010, it had grown to US$4.12 trillion. Further, global chemicals sales are projected to grow about 3 per cent per year to 2050. However, action must be taken to address the issues around unsound management of chemicals which will in turn work to address the implementation of other goals including poverty eradication, health, water and employment.

1.6 billion people depend on forests for livelihoods; natural capital such as forests represent up to 90% of rural poor’s GDP.

Over 40% of the world's oxygen is produced from the rainforests. Forests also filter water. Loss can affect rainfall patterns. 

Forests are home to the vast majority of the world’s terrestrial species, representing 80% of terrestrial biodiversity.

Tropical forests provide pollination services to agriculture valued at US$12 billion per year.

Forest biodiversity is being destroyed at an alarming rate despite the many vital services it provides to humans.

Tropical deforestation believed to lead to disappearance of up to 100 animal and plant species each day.

Deforestation responsible for estimated 17% of all man-made emissions, 50% more than ships, aviation and land transport combined.

Investing US$40 billion a year in the forestry sector could halve deforestation rates by 2030.

This investment could boost tree planting by 140% by 2050, create millions of jobs, and sequester or remove 28% of carbon from the atmosphere.

Encouraging signs: annual forest loss has fallen from 8 to 5 million hectares since 1990. Some regions increased forest area.

The Green Economy initiative has identified forestry as a key sector capable of driving transition to a low-carbon future.

The UN-REDD Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation supports 46 developing countries.

UN REDD create incentives for nations to conserve forests by creating a financial value for carbon stored in trees.

Norway in December pledged US$30 million to scale up REDD+ work in Vietnam.

Vietnam has increased forest coverage from 27% in 1990 to nearly 40%, proving that change is possible.

UNEP & INTERPOL report says organized crime increasingly involved in illegal logging, a trade worth US$30-100 billion annually.

Illegal loggers growing more sophisticated, mixing bribes with hacking, laundering of timber, and mobile operations.

Full report on illegal trade, including recommendations for tackling it, here: http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?, Today being CHANT day, to know more on what is, How to and who is CHANT, please visit the CHANT website, http://bit.ly/TQibp7, Op Ed in The Guardian from UNEP head Achim Steiner and WRI head Andrew Steer on how tech revolution can fight illegal logging: http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/saving-forests-technology-illegal-logging?INTCMP=SRCH, How can YOU help protect our oceans from Climate Change? Here are some useful tips: 
-Turn off electric devices when you are not using them
-Use public transportation 
-Drive more fuel efficient cars 
-Weather proof your home to save energy

-Urge governments and decision makers to adopt policies to promote clean energy and energy efficiency

This month's UNEP GEAS bulletin informs that despite the growing body of norms, rules and many good intentions of achieving global environmental goals, the overall global environmental situation continues to deteriorate. For example, under climate change, atmospheric concentrations of GHGs seems to be increasing to levels that are likely to push global temperatures to more than 2°C above the pre-industrial average, which is the agreed target for planetary well-being. Effects of desertification and drought impact agricultural productivity, while the condition and extent of natural habitats continue to decline and results in significant biodiversity loss. The bulletin advocates new commitments and ways to deal with persistent environmental problems, including the formulation of clear, numerical environmental targets and better data collection to track changes.

The consumption of meat is rapidly growing, as a result of growing economies in many developing countries coupled with steady population growth. The production of meat has serious environmental impacts, one of these being contribution to climate change through emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Overall, meat production is responsible for between 10-25 % of anthropogenic emissions of GHGs.  As meat supply and consumption increase around the world, the new GEAS bulletin encourages more sustainable food systems.

This video project is part of the UNRISD project "Social Dimensions of Green Economy and Sustainable Development"., The tiny fraction of freshwater not bound up in ice sheets and glaciers comprises only a very small fraction of total global water volume (about 0.79 %). Global use of that freshwater, however, has been growing at roughly twice the rate of global population for the past century. Even so, this volume of unfrozen freshwater is still more than adequate to meet all human needs. However, this essential resource, which is mostly stored as groundwater, is distributed quite unevenly around the globe. Furthermore, physical and economic constraints make it impractical in most cases to move great volumes of water from areas of surplus to areas of need. Alarmingly, aquifers in some of the world's major agricultural regions, including China, India and the United States — all of them crucial to the food security of 100s of millions of people — are being exploited unsustainably.

Groundwater Depletion: Regions at Risk - read the latest Global Environmental Alert from UNEP http://bit.ly/w9D9b7, With as much as 40 per cent of the global population living within 100 kilometres of the coast, the world's marine ecosystems provide essential food, shelter and livelihoods to millions of people. But human impacts are increasingly taking their toll the health and productivity of the world's oceans.

Today, some 20 per cent of mangroves have been destroyed, and more than 60 per cent of tropical coral reefs are under immediate, direct threat.

Do you or your community depend on oceans or coastlines? Have you seen any changes in the development of these regions? We'd appreciate your thoughts - for more info on UNEP's findings read this report.

Power lines constitute one of the major causes of unnatural death for birds both through electrocution and fatal collisions. At end of 2010 there were 70.5 million kilometers of power lines throughout the world, constructed with minimal consideration of their environmental impact. This is expected to increase to 76.2 million kilometers by the end of 2015.

In the African-Eurasian region alone, hundreds of thousands of birds die annually from electrocution and tens of millions of birds from collision with power lines.

The Congo basin forest is a natural mosaic of 400 mammalian species, 280 reptile species, 900 butterfly species and 10,000 plant species. At 2 million square kilometres, it is the second largest rainforest in the world, second only to the Amazon forest in Latin America.
However, the forest is under serious threat from a combination of factors like illegal logging and settlements, shifting agriculture, population growth, oil and mining industries. The forest is losing 1.5 million hectares – half of Lesotho – every year.


To stem this loss, UNEP is working with Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) to conserve 29 protected areas, and promote sustainable forestry and community-based conservation in 11 priority landscapes spanning the Congo basin.
