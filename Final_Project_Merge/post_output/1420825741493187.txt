"A few weeks ago, during our February vacation my sons and I stopped for lunch in your restaurant.  We had an amazing meal, but more importantly we had an amazing first time experience for our younger son who has life threatening food allergies.  My 6 year old, has a life threatening dairy and nut allergy and he has never been able to eat bread in a restaurant before, in fact, I have baked all of his bread since he grew out of his wheat allergy three years ago.
 
Your wait staff was incredible.  I do not remember her name, but she was working around noon, on Tuesday, February 16.  She was extremely careful to check the ingredients of all the food.  She made sure everything served to him did not come into contact with dairy or nuts and most amazing, our son was able to have the bread!!!  He felt so good to be a part of things.  He usually eats a piece of my bread I keep in my purse!  In addition to our little guy loving and being able to eat the bread, our 10 year old, loved the bread so much he snuck a few pieces and kept it in his HAT while we walked around the city the rest of the day!  (I assure you, he has never done anything like that before.)
