Try a reversible black/white bow tie. It won't set you apart so much that you'll look out of place nor will it be disrespectful to the event.

(You might also want to make sure that tux you bought 7 years ago still fits you...)  http://bit.ly/TU6QWH, We are always flattered but also get a chuckle when we see our tie bars presented with $175 shirt and a $145 tie.

And while Steven Von Gerlachter has definitely the MOST ugly ties (seriously Steven, that is quite impressive), we think the very ugliest tie is owned by Adam Tschuor, who showed us his vomit-inducing pleated tie. Adam, shoot us an email at info@thetiebar.com, and tell us which 2 ties you'd like for us to send to you. You've earned it., While we're on the topic of ugly ties, let's run a 24-hour contest here on Facebook. Below is a photo of 2 rejects from our inaugural  collection in 2004.

Contest starts...now., Let's hope tonight's Monday Night Football game is more watchable than Stuart Scott's atrocious mix of a narrow striped tie with a tiny checked shirt or Mike Ditka's hideous vertical striped tie., Today's "Look of the Week" - Stewart Plaid. There is a long history about this Scottish design, but frankly - after reading it - we decided it's a bit boring to retell on Facebook. But the look is anything but boring.

Available in 20 colors., Fairly sizable restock today of knits, skinnies, XL's, bows, etc., including the "Knit Country Stripe - Navy/Orange" tie that was featured in last month's GQ which flew off our shelves (and Nordstrom's)., The crazy stuff you can find on YouTube these days..., Coming in November, Donegal Wool ties. The only $15 Donegal Wool ties on the market., Ok...coming down from the excitement of bow ties at the Emmy's, this week's "Look of the Week" shows the 2 different ways you can wear our Reversible Bow Ties (one of these ways simply requires an extra twist when tying it.)
