#InspireAndBeInspired #BeAGoalDiggerNotAGoldDigger #HardWorkPaysOff #AdrianneMariePhotography #DoingWhatILoveAndLovingWhatIDo, Omgoodness this is so funny! This guy nailed it! This really explains the cost of Wedding photography the things people don't think of when they are looking to hire a professional it is more than the 8-10 hours spent with you on your wedding day. I'm still laughing at the voices and how slow the are talking... Happy Monday everyone!, One of my Favorites <3, Hello FB friends if you haven't checked your "invited you to like pages -you can find it in the same section as invites and birthdays" recently please do I sent you something if you like what you see please go ahead and like my photography page and choose to follow it and select see first under notifications if you like seeing the photos I post. I have had many people say they don't see my posts anymore even though they are a fan of the page, FB has changed the way they do things now you have to select "see first" on the pages you want to see. Being a fan is not the same anymore... Thank you to all my fans out there! Happy Wednesday ❤, Jen Chamberlain & Jason's gallery is up click the link to check it out... What a Beautiful Wedding <3, <3 What a beautiful young lady., I love this because some people think if you have a great camera you will take great pictures. This shows you 6 professionals and each one is very different from the next. Find and choose a photographer that matches your style and you love their work, instead of selecting them by price. I do understand price matters because like most people I am on a budget myself. Even if you have to work out a payment plan to make it work. Do it! If you do it right the first time you will have no regrets and won't have to pay to have it done again. Remember your wedding day especially is a once in a life time event that cannot be redone if you are not happy with the outcome. It breaks my heart when people come into my studio to have newborn pictures taken and tell me stories of how they were completely disappointed with their wedding photos and wish that they had hired me instead of going with someone who was just a little bit cheaper. Because after the day is over that you have spent endless hours planning. All that money has been spent the cake has been eaten and the flowers have died, all the dancing is just a memory and all you have left is your wedding photos. Make sure you will love them because you trust the person you hired to capture your big day., Check out the whole gallery of this Beautiful Wedding that was chosen to be featured in Bride & Groom Magazine.
