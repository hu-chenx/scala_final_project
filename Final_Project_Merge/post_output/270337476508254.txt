 This is the translation we had in Fizzz #6:

Saloon, located in the basement of the main street restaurant Foundry on Elm, is the classic idea of a speakeasy: There is no entry sign or name on the door. The small, dark bar kidnaps guests back to the time of the Manhattan before Prohibition. The interior comes in part from a 17th century monastery. Beverage Manager Manny Gonzales focuses on whisk(e)y, a little over 140 different varieties are on the menu, especially Rye, Single Malt Scotch and Japanese Whisky with less current attention to Bourbon. Saloon maintains the old school cocktail, but still has an eye towards the future. Routinely Manny is also coordinating whiskey classes for guests and multi-course dinners in a cozy, family style atmosphere., Apparently we are featured in here. Anyone speak German? , On Tuesday, June 17th, join our Resident Malt Man Manny & learn the craft of whiskey blending, the latest class in our summer whiskey series!
