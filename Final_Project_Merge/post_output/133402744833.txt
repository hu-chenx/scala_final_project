Buona Pasqua., 14 Years ago today I opened a little restaurant in The North End of Boston.  I was 25 when I started the project.  With the help of my Parents we talked Century Bank into giving us a loan and put together 20 people that invested in this crazy idea on a side street.  I got David Petrilli as the general manager and partner, who put together a wait staff (most of whom are still here today).  I put together a kitchen crew and we cultivated over the years a great loyal clientele.  Thanks to everyone that has made this possible and continues to do so..., Back to school with Boston.com...

When I first opened Prezza I was trying to force certain dishes on people.  I was definitely some what Ego driven and in need of a check.  I was young, 26 actually.  I ignored small individual complaints by customers and friends as well as sound advice.  Then our second review came out by Mat Shaffer at the Herald, it was less than favorable.  At first I was mad and then I realized he was right.  It helped to change how and what we cooked from that day on and helped Prezza evolve to what it is today. 
, Here is the link to the Ham Glazed with balsamic and figs Video that I made yesterday.  Great Easter Idea if you want to try something different.  Pm me if you have questions.

3.  Don't use Arborio Rice, use Carnaroli Rice from Italy.  
4.  Risotto should run a little and then stop, it shouldn't be a lump of starch like mashed potatoes.

The staff deserves it and its always a nice feeling to be closed a couple days, especially for Christmas.  Merry Christmas to you and see you Thursday..., Every Year I get some emails asking how to cook a roast so I thought I would share my recent response with everyone. This was for a 12 lb Bone in Rib Eye Roast.

Place the Rib Eye on a raised rack in a roasting pan at 450f for 30 mins, then turn it down to 325 on bake not convection,and cook it until the center is 110, take it out and let it sit covered for 30 minutes the temperature will slowly raise to 130 and this will give you a perfect med rare. 
If you want medium then cook it until 115 and let it sit covered for 30 minutes and this will give you a good medium. Take it out and Wrap it really good with foil, a couple of layers is best to really keep the heat in or place it in something with a cover. The roast continues to cook for the next 30 minutes when its out of the oven, do not cut into the meat once its cooked before letting it sit, you have to trust the thermometer. If you cut it ahead of time when it comes out of the oven it will stop the carry over cooking process. 

The right thermometer is key to this entire process. One of those remote ones works great and you can set the alarm on it, you need a thermometer with numbers on it so you can tell what temp it is. Some Grocery stores have these and also Home Depot or Lowes I have a picture of mine below. A lot of the supermarket ones tell you when they think its done like med, med rare or well done and by then its too late, throw these away or don't buy them. Make sure you tie the roast too. As far as how long, a roast this size I would plan on at least an hour and half but give yourself plenty of time. With the bone in it might take 2 hours. This technique can be used for any roast pork or beef. For Pork cook it to 120 and it will be perfect Med Well with just a little pink which is perfectly fine.

When its done and you take it out keep it some where warm. I have a heat lamp above my stove, when its done I keep the roast under that but some ovens let you turn them down low to 110 or so, if you have room and an oven that can get that low then I would put it in there with the door shut. You can hold it for at least an hour like that maybe longer especially if you don't keep opening it and looking inside. Still keep it covered in there too. If you don't have a low oven or space then on top of the cook stove or just near it will help but remember to keep it covered and don't uncover it. With modern technology just take a picture of it and show curious inlaws that must see it. Merry Christmas, Back on the Menu.  Wood Grilled Bone in Tenderloin.

I will keep you updated as it progresses for sure., Sorry Guys, its been a while.  But to be honest there has not been much excitement to comment on, but here is an update.  We were hoping to reopen in early October, and although it was a small fire this is pretty much like rebuilding and starting over, we have to go through the same process.  We are hoping to get the building permit this week or the beginning of next.  We have narrowed down our budget from the insurance company and decided on a contractor, which is a huge step.  There was some structural work in the building that needed to be addressed and we are hoping to wrap that up this week as well.  If all falls together as planned we should be able to really start in to the work the end of next week.  From there its about six weeks of work, so we hope to be open the end of November or the beginning of December. 
The renovations will include new booths and chairs for the dining room and some cosmetic touch ups.  The Ladys room was completely destroyed so it will undergo a complete makeover.

NEW Projected date of opening: October 1st (cross those fingers)., RECIPE - Lamp Shank

A great way to use up some of those summer veggies.

Ingredients:
4 lamb shanks
2 large red onions sliced
4 large carrots sliced
1 head of fennel halfed and sliced
4 cloves of garlic chopped
4 cups of chopped tomato or canned
¬Ω gallon of lamb or dark veal stock
¬Ω bottle of dry red wine

In a large oven proof sauce pot, brown the lamb shanks in a little vegetable oil and remove. If necessary add a little more oil and saut√© the red onion until they begin to caramelize.

Next, add the carrots and saut√© until they begin to slightly caramelize. Add the fennel and garlic and saut√© lightly. Add the tomato and reduce until the liquid is just about gone. Then, add the red wine and reduce fully. After that, add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the lamb shanks, cover and braise in a 300 degree oven for about 1.5-2 hours or until fork tender.

Remove from the oven and carefully take the shanks out, strain and reserve the liquid and then reduce it to a nice glaze. Arrange the shanks in a platter and glaze them with the reduced sauce., Something fun and unique to do this summer - a North End tour with Michele Topor - http://www.bostonfoodtours.com/, Some makeshift office action., A sneak peek at ALL of the liquor that we had to dispose of this week (Board of Health orders).

Let us know how it turns out!

Nonnie Theresa‚Äôs Pizzagaina

This recipe is enough for approximately 3, 10 x 13 ‚Äúpies‚Äù, glass or enamel baking dishes. The reason it is so big is because traditionally you give a lot away, even swapping for some ones else‚Äôs who may have a slightly different recipe.

Dough
4 cups Flour
¬Ω cup spry (Cisco)
2 eggs
1 cup water

In a large mixing bowl mix spry and flour.  After mixing add eggs and water and continue to mix until mixed thoroughly. Set aside.

Filling
1 ¬Ω lbs. Genoa salami cubed ¬º inch thick
1 ¬Ω lbs. fresh farmers cheese
4-4 ¬Ω lbs. cooked or boiled ham (prosciutto can be used but may be saltier) cubed in ¬º inch pieces
6 lbs. whole milk ricotta cheese
3 dozen large eggs
1 cup grated cheese
black pepper added with cheese to taste

In a large bowl mix all ingredients until well mixed.

* Grease glass or enamel baking dishes with spry. Then sprinkle flour on the bottom of the pan. 
* Cut a piece of dough and roll out to fit over the dish. Dough must be thin, placed firmly onto dish and cut excess from the top. Use excess to make basket weave pattern on top before baking.
* Scoop mixture into dishes ¬º to ¬Ω inch from top to allow rising. 
* Make basket weave leaving 2 inch spaces in between. 
* Bake at 350 for 1 ¬Ω hours or until knife comes out clear. 

Let cool, best served at room temperature., Our Twitter bud @LaurenEForcucci made these delicious zeppolis from a recipe on our blog (also below) over the weekend.  Do you love zeppolis as much as we do?

2/3        cup sugar
2/3        cup sour cream
3tbsp    melted butter
2 1/4     cup flour
2tsp      baking powder
1/2        tsp salt
 
1)         Mix eggs, sugar, sour cream until combined. Add vanilla and melted butter.
2)         Sift flour, baking powder and salt together and add to the mixer, (do not over mix).
3)         Let rest one hour.
4)         Scoop with a one ounce ice cream scooper and drop directly into a table top fryer (set at 375 degrees) until golden brown.
