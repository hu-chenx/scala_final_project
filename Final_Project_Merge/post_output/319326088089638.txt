Near the end of the Roman Empire in 270 A.D., Claudius, the Roman Emperor, decided to ban marriage as a quality control measure for the army. Claudius had a simple goal of taking over the world, and Claudius believed that unmarried men were better soldiers than married men because married men were more emotionally attached to their home and families.  Nonetheless, a local priest, named Valentine, continued to marry young lovers on the sly.  The Emperor was enraged, and had Valentine arrested.  Valentine's fate was sealed and the Emperor condemned him to death and created a Saint in the process.   Lore has it that Valentine, while awaiting execution, miraculously restored the sight of one of his jailor's daughters, and they became very close friends.  Before he died, he wrote her a letter and signed  "From your Valentine."  A tradition was born.

White wines are often made with grapes that have yellow or green skins.  White wines can also be made from dark-skinned grapes if the grape skins are removed from the juices early enough, before the fermentation process.  Red wines get their color from the contact time with the skins of dark grapes during fermentation.
