http://sampan.org/2016/02/boston-city-council-president-michelle-wu-rings-in-lunar-new-year/, Meet Artist Aur√©lie Galois :
Aur√©lie began learning every traditional technique of oil painting, engraving, charcoal and pastels in a private studio in Paris. After earning a Masters in Literature from Sorbonne University and History of Art from The School of the Louvre, she worked as an editor-in-chief at a Paris magazine. Galois found herself painting the portraits of her interview subjects to tell their stories on her canvas. Today she publishes and exhibits her work regularly, while actively taking commissions for portraits. Recent exhibitions include ‚ÄúMicro Salon‚Äù at L‚ÄôInlassable Galerie in Paris ‚Äî a collaboration of 88 artists focused under the sole constraint of working in a small format ‚Äî and two solo shows at Sloane Merrill Gallery and UForge Gallery in Boston., Liquid Art House Presents Erotic Art Pop-up of Petit Portraits By French Painter Aur√©lie Galois This Weekend Only.

Pair this incredible ambiance with L.A.H.‚Äôs delicious menu, and it is hard to find fault with anything here!

#DuckRocks30 D'Artagnan, It's no wonder Meghan Howland's dreamlike paintings reside in the private collections of Designer Georgina Chapman and Producer Harvey Weinstein. 
Howland leaves the question of whether something is safe or dangerous, loving or hateful, unexplained in her work. By conveying an ambiguous situation, the viewer is left with the Responsibility of resolving what's happening, thus creating a space where an unending range of emotions, and possibilities, can live... Explore the fragility. Ponder the isolation. See it / Buy it at LAH.

BLO‚Äôs use of recognizable images and themes create a direct basis of familiarity with the audience. The body, specifically the sexualized female form, harks back to aspect of the ‚Äúmale gaze,‚Äù where the influence of Egon Schiele is seen in the use of truncated bodies, loose lines and sexual confrontation. It is also within this reconfiguration of the physical body where aspects of the surrealist sculptor/photographer Hans Bellmer can be seen by BLO‚Äôs embrace of tension via the use of physical abstraction and negative space. Other iconic references pervade the work such as religious imagery (especially the iconic Virgin Mary and the Christ Child), mememto mori, and occult symbolism., Few seats still remain!

Excerpt
...chef Rachel Klein of Liquid Art House, the 10,000-square-foot restaurant/gallery
in the Back Bay, believes that it‚Äôs just good business to market to tots. ‚ÄúFrom a chef‚Äôs perspective,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be stupid not to cater to children. They‚Äôre future diners. They eat out more than they ever have.‚Äù Klein, the mother of 3-year-old Eva and 7-year-old Ethan, is sensitive to parents‚Äô struggle to maintain their own interests‚Äîlike good food, wine and company‚Äîin the face of family demands. When she was at the Seaport Hotel‚Äôs Aura, Klein created the popular event series Fine Dining, Family Style, where parents could grab cocktails and a refined meal while their children could design their own bento box, then be entertained by crafts and activities in a separate play area. Plans are in the works for a similar family-centric event at LAH, where parents will be able to dine at leisure while their kids learn about and create art‚Äîwithout breaking any of the thousand-dollar Lithuanian glasswork on display. ‚ÄúChildren might not understand what‚Äôs around them,‚Äù Klein says of fine art and food, ‚Äúbut they‚Äôre exposed to it.‚Äù She speaks from experience. ‚ÄúI grew up going to art galleries, and my dad painted. Every year we had a trip to Europe and a trip somewhere in the U.S. And I remember that‚Äîmy fondest memories were food and art memories. What my parents have exposed me to has really affected me.‚Äù #inthenews #liquidarthouse #chef #kids #boston #resataurant, Boom Boom Do-Over!

‚ÄúIt opened last year and is slowly changing Boston‚Äôs social scene. Guests range from highbrow to hipster, which is a big step away from the city‚Äôs traditional ‚Äî and somewhat polarizing‚Äî establishments.

"I‚Äôm always happy to find a restaurant that invests in desserts. Too many exciting meals taper off to a dull finish. There is nothing boring about the elaborate, multicomponent creations of Liquid Art House pastry chef Giselle Miller. They match chef Rachel Klein‚Äôs pretty savory presentations step for step. I particularly appreciated a coconut rice pudding with mango, aloe, black sesame, and Asian basil sorbet..." #gratitude

Artist Vytas Sakalas calls his work 'Tranceformationism' because while painting, he employs a meditative process that invariably leads to a mild state of trance. He began working with wrinkled canvas quite by accident‚Ä¶ After attempting to wash a stained canvas in the washing machine and hanging to dry, he liked the wrinkles so much, he decided to work with them instead of trying to obliterate them by ironing them out. He saw the wrinkles as another manifestation of chance and randomness, which are ubiquitous in nature.
