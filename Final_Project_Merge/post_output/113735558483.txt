This year the Wade's World Foundation decided to host a special festival called "Choose to Live, Live to Dream". This festival was in line with a special pledge and six week camp conducted in Chicago to help aid in assistance to end violence among youth. Over 200 kids signed the pledge, and attended the camp which supported youth in underserved communities by exposing them to an array of diverse activities, education, and trainings to ignite, expand and nurture their raw talents, abilities and aspirations at no cost.

DID YOU KNOW - The idea for Wade's World Foundation has been with Dwyane since he was 7 years old. Watching a segment from a local Chicago news station where celebrities visited school children made him wonder why the celebrities hadn’t visited his neighborhood.

In 2003, the opportunity presented itself and he kept his word to the little boy inside of him., Wade's World Foundation partnered with Barrier Breakdown Transformed (BBT) to have a FUN-raiser!

The former is biological, the latter emotional.  Fathering is an act of nature; being a Dad is all nurture. It's certainly much simpler to become a father than it is to commit to becoming a Dad.
 
Every child needs a Dad who may or might not be his or her biological father. A Dad is someone who’s there when a child needs him most, in good times and bad, when guidance and the gifts of an open ear and caring heart are most important.
 
Dads come in all ages and stages of life.  Grandfathers and uncles, cousins and big brothers, family friends, teachers, clergy, coaches and mentors, and even commanding officers can play the role of Dad at critical moments in a young person's life." (author unknown)
