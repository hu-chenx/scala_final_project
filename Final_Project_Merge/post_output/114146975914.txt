Many current members know that Gabrielle is the girlfriend of Justin Cahill, a former Zips Goalie. Gabrielle's car was vandalized and flipped over during Sumner fest last night, where riot police were called in to action. Her insurance company is not covering any of the damages. I am calling on my Zips family and friends to give a little something towards Gabrielle's cause. Let us prove that Akron is not full of Anarchic hooligans, and willing to help family when they are in need.


Anything helps. 

Thank you
Chandler Thompson

Let's get back on that winning streak. You can catch the updates of the game on twitter @ZipsHockeyClub or right here on facebook!!! See ya fans tomorrow!!!, Everyone needs to read this, Joe Berney,

SO, today is the one month anniversary of the NHL lockout. The news said today that both sides are now interested in talking about the issues...... So here is a proposal to anyone that is a hockey fan. If 2,000,000 people in North America don't spend $500 on anything NHL that is $1,000,000,000 in revenue. If or when the NHL decides they are going grace us with their presents and think that the fans kiss their ass and spend money on them, I ask anyone that is a hockey fan, DON,T DO IT. Don't buy tickets, don't buy jerseys, don't buy TV pacakges. Instead spend it your local rink, spend it at a petes game or generals game or any Junior team you want and if your in the area, go out to dinner at one of the places that is losing money, or putting people out of work.
Four times in 20 years is enough, it's more than any other sport. The NHL is the fourth of the 4 major team sports in North America, 5th if you include NASCAR. They treat you and I like they are all we have for sport or hockey for that matter. You and I can do something about the reported $3,300,000,000 they are fighting over. Gary Bettman, Donald Fehr, NHL owners and players will still get their millions at the end of the day. Pass this along to any friend of yours that is a hockey fan. Don't spend the money on the NHL, don't allow them to forget about the damage they have caused. lets take a stand now and make them work for your respect.....

Joe had this on his face book page it wouldn't let me share it so I copied and pasted this! Way to go Mr.Berney, null, People ask why I drive all the way up to Cuyahoga Falls to work. Read this and it explains why I love working for this company!, See we can do this right here at the University of Akron!!!!! Let's go ZIPS, WOW another nice story from www.crashthenet.com 

Thank you all for helping this weekend making this a hit!, The University of Akron Hockey Club will  Honor ALL of our Military Veterans  November 10th. at 3:40pm at Center Ice Sports Complex right next to the Akron Canton Airport.
