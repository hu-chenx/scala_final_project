We apologize for any inconvenience.  We will reopen tomorrow evening at 5:00pm and look forward to welcoming you then., I was lucky enough to be able to attend this pop up 12 course dessert "dinner" in New York City. Here is a great re-cap about the whole experience. -Jaime, Pastry Chef, At the bottom of the label on every bottle of Pimm's No. 1, there is a series of cities from around the world with years associated with them. Over the course of the last week or so, we have scoured the internet and exhausted almost all of our resources at Diagio (the product's importer) and beyond to try and find out what these cities and years represent, with no success. The most educated response came (naturally) from David Wondrich, renowned cocktail historian, who informed us that the cities and dates probably refer to awards won at trade shows. The only conundrum that we cannot get a solid answer for is why two of the cities, Chicago and New Orleans, have corresponding dates that fall within prohibition. Lots of conjecture has been thrown around to explain this, but nothing concrete. Does anyone have any thoughts?  -Ted, Bar Director, This is a Chef that I formerly worked for. He is incredibly talented and inspiring. - Jaime, Pastry Chef, New desserts are on the horizon! Here's a peak a the newest one to join the menu. Grapefruit tart with bay leaf sherbet and vanilla meringue. - Jaime, Pastry Chef, Our Chef gets some much deserved recognition in the New York Times!, A quiet night at No. 9 = more opportunities to do awesome things for our guests! April is on her way to do a table-side ice cream sundae demo for a little boy in the dining room. We love it. -Meredith Hutchins, Director of Guest Relations, Tyler and I are having a blast tonight nailing down the last few recipes for the new cocktail menu before it gets sent to our designer. Stay tuned for exciting new cocktails and menu format brought to you by your friends behind the bar at No. 9 Park. -Ted, Bar Manager, Final staff sustenance for NYE 2011: PB&J with apple slices served around 11:30pm, just after our last table was seated. Happy New Year to our incredible crew, thanks for a great New Year's Eve and hope everyone had a wonderful (and restful) first day of 2012.

“What are "True" vs. "False" truffles?
In Europe, the term "truffle" in the very strictest ("true") sense has historically only referred to those hypogeous (belowground) fungi that were gourmet edibles, primarily in the genus Tuber.
 Tubers are members of a larger grouping of fungi called Ascomycetes. For some folks, only Tubers and their close relatives are considered "true truffles" (all others being "false truffles"), and for other folks all hypogeous Ascomycetes (irrespective of culinary qualities) are called "true truffles". 
However, there are many, many other perfectly nice species of truffle that are not particularly prized as food outside the squirrel community.” (From: http://www.natruffling.org/)

RARE AND TRUE TRUFFLES AVAILABLE TONIGHT!  Squirrels or no, everyone welcome.
