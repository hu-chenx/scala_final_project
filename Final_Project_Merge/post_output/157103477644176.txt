 The Olivia Act, named after one of the children killed in Newtown, was started by a fellow photographer, who would like to remain anonymous. Olivia’s family had family pictures taken a short time before she was killed on that horrible day. I have seen what having those last photos can mean to a family member and it truly means the world to them. Upon hearing about this, this photographer was moved to give away a 30 minute family photo shoot and has challenged other photographers to do the same. I know that not all families have the resources to have photos taken every year, but I'd love 2013 to be the year for one of them.
 
I will be taking nominations for a family who you think would appreciate this gift of memories. The session will take place sometime after the new year. Email me your nominations to valarie@silvasix.com including a brief message on who you're nominating and the reason you'd love them to get this. The family chosen will be contacted via email (preferred) or phone if email is unavailable so please include that as well. I will be taking nominations until Dec 31st. Please SHARE this status so your friends and family will know too! Can't wait to gift a family with these memories that can't be replaced or taken away!, Merry Christmas to everyone!! Love <3 the Silva Six! Hope your day is filled with happiness and love and dont forget to take lots of pictures :), Since hearing of the tragedies that happened on Friday in Newtown my mind hasn't wandered far from thinking of the sweet innocent faces of the little ones that were taken. I've been trying to think of a way to help and then this morning I came across this....
