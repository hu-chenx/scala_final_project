http://mlb.mlb.com/bos/fenwaypark100/index.jsp, Do you plan on spending this Memorial Day Weekend outside grilling up some delicious meals for the family?  We have some great tips to help make your BBQ even better this year!    

- Want to make your grill non-stick?  Cut an onion in half and run the cut side on the heated grill grate.
- Don't use cold meat when you barbecue.  Always bring your meat back to room temperature before putting in on the grill as it helps keep the meat nice and juicy!
- Stick to marmalades and spice rubs, not BBQ sauce.  Sugar burns when exposed to heat for too long which causes charring before the meat is cooked.
- Heavily marbled steaks are prone to flare-ups on the grill; medium heat and a watchful eye is the key.
- Don't forget the veggies!  Corn on the cob, portobello mushrooms, and asparagus are always great on the grill - just be sure to brush lightly with oil and spices!, Grab the kids and head to Boston for Memorial Day with our Family Fun package! http://bit.ly/1ngLwtc, Lemonade Stand is now open!

Agostinho (right) graduates this coming May, and actually spent time at our sister DoubleTree hotel in Downtown cross-training in front desk operations, food & beverage and housekeeping in 2013. Not only does he speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese, but he’s also a member of Newbury’s Men’s Soccer team, playing NCAA Division III level soccer since 2010.  
 
My (left) is also a Senior, and has had a variety of hospitality and customer service experiences as well as having attended college at the University of Houston.  Like Agostinho, she has amazing language skills being fluent in both English and Vietnamese, and enjoyed being a member of the Alpha Kappa Delta Phi Sorority in Texas. 
 
Their thoughts on the experience thus far; “the people at DT are very nice and very real.  It gives me an opportunity to stretch myself. It can be pretty challenging to communicate with the guest and handle things smoothly with guests and team members depending on the situation. Communication is key.   I am getting to spend time with different people and learn from their experiences, which is great and it feels like family here”., We are proud to partner with Newbury College with the welcoming of two Hotel & Restaurant Management interns Agostinho Lam and My Huyhn!  As part of their academic requirements at Newbury, both interns will be with our Front Office staff from January thru May for a total of 150 hours each, so be sure to say hello if you see them during your stay., We had the great pleasure of celebrating another milestone Anniversary last week - Cheryl "Mama" has been with The DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Boston- Cambridge for 25 years.

, Yummy Yummy!  Today is "World Nutella Day".
If you are not familiar with this delicious spread which combines chocolate and hazelnut, you sure are missing out!  Did you know that Nutella has been around since the 1940s and was created by the founder of Ferrero Company?!
Looking for unique ways to enjoy this delicious treat, other than as a spread?  Check out the recipe we have below…  Doesn't it sound magnificent?

Marshmallow, Peanut Butter, & Nutella Swirl Blondies
Makes 1 8-inch square pan; about 16 blondies
Ingredients:
For blondies
6 TBS unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup light brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 cup peanut butter (creamy or crunchy, but don’t use old-fashioned/natural)
2 large eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp kosher salt
For Nutella swirl
1 1/2 oz dark chocolate or chocolate with hazelnuts, chopped (I like Ritter Sport bars)
1/2 TBS butter
1/4 cup Nutella
2 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows
1 cup milk chocolate chips
pinch of kosher salt
Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 350ºF with a rack in the center position.  Line an 8″ square baking pan with non-stick foil, leaving a slight overhang of foil on the sides of the pan.  
2. For blondies: If using a mixer, beat the butter and sugars in a large bowl on medium-high speed until soft and combined.  It’s just as easy to combine thoroughly with a rubber spatula in a large bowl.  Add the peanut butter and vanilla and mix until combined (on medium speed with mixer).  Add eggs and mix or beat until just combined.
3. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.  Add the baking powder and salt and mix until combined.  Add flour and mix just until incorporated – don’t over mix!  Transfer the batter into the prepared pan.  Spread evenly with a rubber or offset spatula.  
4.  For swirl: Combine the butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave in 45-second intervals at 50% power, stirring between intervals, until melted.  Add the Nutella and stir to combine.
5.  Drop Nutella mixture by spoonfuls over the batter in the pan.  Drag a sharp knife through the Nutella mixture and the batter to create a marbled effect.  (Really, it doesn’t matter what it looks like on top because we’re going to cover it up.  You just want the Nutella mixture to be distributed through the blondie.)
6.  Bake for 25-28 minutes until a tester inserted into the blondie comes out mostly clean.  
7.  Take pan out of the oven and immediately sprinkle marshmallows over the top.  Turn the oven down to 325ºF and put the pan back in the oven for 3 minutes.  Cool blondies in the pan on a cooling rack for about 20 minutes.  Refrigerate for 15 minutes to finish setting the marshmallows.
8.  Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute at 70% power.  Stir.  If necessary, continue to microwave in 30-second intervals at 70% power until smooth.  Stir in pinch of salt.
9.  Pour melted chocolate over blondies and spread evenly with an offset spatula.  Refrigerate blondies (still in the pan!) until chocolate is set, about an hour.  If the chocolate isn’t totally set and firm, don’t even think about cutting them yet.  Be patient!.
10.  To cut blondies, lift them out of the pan with the foil lining.  The blondies should slide off of the foil onto a cutting board, which will make cutting easier.  Slice and enjoy!, null, We are excited to announce that today we begin working on our creative collaboration design that we have titled "DT HEART ART"!  All month long we will have a table set up in our lobby and we are asking all team members and guests to participate in contributing to our HEART ART to raise money for American Heart Association.  Directions are simple; we are asking for a minimum donation of $1 and in turn we will give you a small index card and red marker to draw a heart.  You must, however, stay tuned for the completed HEART ART which will be posted on our Facebook page at the end of the month!

Taryn Dion (Director of Front Office Operations) has been with The DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Boston – Cambridge since November 2013.  She is the glue for all operational departments; front desk, housekeeping, and engineering.   
Taryn started her Hilton journey 8 years ago at the Hilton Boston Logan Airport hotel as a Guest Service Agent, - "I was one of those girls that graduated high school, and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life".  After a week of being a Guest Service Agent, she knew she had found her place.  "That feeling you get when someone tells you that you made their vacation special, and made them feel at home is pretty darn rewarding".  Thus, her career path with Hilton began.
Almost 2 years in to being a Guest Service Agent, Taryn was promoted to the Rooms Coordinator/ Revenue Analyst. Tough economic times were upon us, and it was time for a change.  Taryn moved from the Hilton at Logan Airport to the DoubleTree Boston Downtown where she assumed the role of Night Auditor/Overnight Manager and held that role until becoming the Assistant Front Office Manager and finally, Front Office Manager at the DoubleTree Boston Downtown.
After 4 great years at the DoubleTree Downtown, Taryn was promoted to their sister property, the DoubleTree Boston Bayside, as Director of Front Office Operations, a position that she held up until becoming our Director of Front Office Operations.  "I was EXTREMELY excited as I had clearly made my way around the Hiltons of Boston, and made it a personal goal to become a team member at this property!  Hilton's focus on our Guest's satisfaction is first class.  I can't imagine myself wanting to represent any other company".

Be sure to stop by our front desk and say hello to Taryn the next time you are at the hotel!, MEET OUR NEW STAFF:
Paul Saltalamacchia (Senior Catering Manager) has been with The DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Boston- Cambridge since September 2013.  He is the go to guy for all your social catering needs!  Paul has worked with other Hospitality companies in the past but we couldn't be happier to have him here with us!  
With over 15 years of experience in the Hospitality Industry Paul has had many experiences and has worked all kinds of events – although weddings are his favorite!  "Making a couple's vision a reality is a passion of mine.  The look on a couple's faces when they enter the ballroom is priceless to me.  It makes it all worth it" says Paul.  He also enjoys working with Bar/ Bat Mitzvahs as they are quite different from weddings and always so much fun – "working with kids is great!"
On a more personal note, Paul gave us some fun and interesting facts to share with our followers.  Paul is an animal lover; he has adopted 9 retired greyhounds and currently has 2.  He is a huge supporter of Save the Greyhound Rescue League.  With a degree in Romance Languages he is passionate about learning foreign languages.  Paul is also a family man – he has 3 adult children and he loves spending time with them whenever possible.  You can often find them gardening, enjoying the beach and pool or working on home improvement projects!

They happened to give it to us just at the right time when there happens to be lots of signs of spring. NO SNOW!! 

Spring cleaning tips for your bedroom...

Flip the Mattress: To keep even wear on your mattress, it’s wise to flip it periodically. You should do it every 4 months so it can wear evenly.

Change the Bedding, Now open the windows...let some fresh air in
Wash your curtains or air them out on a clothesline
Clean your screens and windows

Change your heavy blankets for lighter bedding

If your pillows are washable...do it. If not replace them. They can have mold and bacteria.
Clean out all your drawers and closets...donate or store the cold weather clothing.
Don't forget to dust your smoke alarm and replace the batteries while you are at it., If you're in town for the weekend and looking to do some shopping... Take our complimentary shuttle to Harvard Square, p-u the Redline inbound (2 stops) to Kendall/MIT.  From there you can take the complimentary shuttle to the Cambridgeside Galleria.

This type of agriculture is based on the theories of Rudolph Steiner and is a symbiotic relationship between the grape, the soil, human, and animal interaction.  Often the plantings of grapevines are connected to the lunar calendar and the various cycles of nature.  Furthermore, the vineyard is self-sustaining and self-contained!   This spring, as part of our Deeply Rooted wine program, we have several biodynamic, organic, and sustainable wines to try!  Hess Shirtail Creek Vineyard Chardonnay, a crisp white with a tropical fruit finish & Jade Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, a red with hints of red cherry and blueberry with a chocolate finish are both from California and just two of the wines we are currently pouring!, We are now in the middle of restaurant week! What better way to start the spring season than having the option to dine is over 200 of Boston's best restaurants throughout the city.

Certain conditions ...apply, With the beautiful days on the way.. It's time for a fresh start. This also means Spring Cleaning! Here are a couple of tips to help you spend less time cleaning and more time enjoying the sun's rays. Today our Rooms Director Carolyn Vencile & Reservations Manager Allison Docouto gave us a few great tips.

1. The most highly reccomended cleaning products to pick-up are, Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner which happens to also be non-toxic but can work on the toughest of stains. Also no one can deny that the top favorite is Mr. Clean's Magic Eraser.. They are almost too much fun to use! 

2. Start High & Work Down! Start all your cleaning dusting high and end the cleaning by vaccuming. This ensures you won't have to go back and clean what you already finished. 

3. Another great tip that can also help with recycling is using old newspaper to clean glass & windows. It not only helps you reduce & reuse, but it also won't leave lint behind like some clothes or paper towels.

She pointed out some great highlights in the interview, which made us all even more excited to start the building on Monday!!

What do you like most about your job?

I love the experience of interacting with different groups and always meeting new people. Each event brings on new challenge, and our team always comes up with creative ways to make each event a success.

What are you looking forward to most for our upcoming renovations?

The change of everything in general is really exciting. I am looking forward to our new fireplace overlooking the Charles River. It is going to bring a unique feature to our hotel, and since it’s in the lobby we will be able to provide a new warm welcome to all our guests.

Other than the look of hotel, what else will the renovation bring for functions? 

The rooftop terrace will most likely have the most impact. It’s an entire new space! Groups will be able to hold cocktail receptions, and have a beautiful view of the city, or we can even host wedding events there for an unforgettable experience.

Congratulation on becoming Manager of the Year! What is your focus for this year to come?

I will continue to foster the relationships we have in place while making new ones as well! I’m really looking forward to it.
