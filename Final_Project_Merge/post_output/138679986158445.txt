Come get yours before we close on November 15th., We here at Hough Many Scoops were sad to learn this morning that our shop had been vandalized sometime during the night. At first glance it may seem like just a broken window, but to those of us who call Houghs Neck our home, it is much more than that.

Over the past few months there have been escalating occurrences of graffiti, vandalism to vehicles, and vandalism to property.  Enough is enough of this destruction to people's property. It is time we all started taking these acts personally since Houghs Neck is all of ours.

As a community, let's be more vigilant, pay more attention, report what we see, and speak up when something is wrong, we can make a difference.

Adree Delvecchio was 5 years old when she was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. At a regular checkup her new doctor discovered a faint heart murmur. Upon further examination, the doctors discovered that Adree had a severe abnormality of the right coronary artery, and a leak in her mitral valve. Because of this, her blood flow was backing up, and she would need surgery. 

For 6 months following her operation, she went to weekly appointments and was prescribed a course of blood thinners. In 2014, she was diagnosed with a bone disease-- after two broken arms and 3 casts-- it was discovered she had low bone density. Adree's body was not allowing her to absorb Calcium and Vitamin D. 

It has been a very long road for Adree and her family. Without the help and support of family and friends and the outstanding care of all the nurses and doctors at Childrens Hospital, Adree would not be where she is today.

Adree is presently doing well and these experiences have made her very compassionate. Adree came up with a way to help give back to the place that has given her so much.

On Monday, August 31, 2015 from 11am-10pm, Adree wants to know, "Hough Many Scoops?" Please come and join Adree and her friends and family at Hough Many Scoops, 1094 Sea St in Houghs Neck, Quincy any time throughout the day. A portion of the proceeds of sales for the day will be donated directly to Children's Hospital Boston. Our goal is to raise as much money as possible and we hope you can help out in a small way by joining us. If you can't make it-- you can click on the link on this page and donate a specific amount. Every penny helps and you are making a difference.
