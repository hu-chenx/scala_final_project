Don't be a stranger at ICOB, Boston magazine's Best of Boston issue comes out next week, but they're offering sneak peeks and today we learned we won for Best Lobster Roll:  "There are a few ways to enjoy this new Kenmore Square institution: tucked away in the corner of the dining room by the oyster-shell-lined walls; perched at a high-top in the lounge; or sitting at the raw bar. Wherever we wind up, you’ll find us throwing back bivalves followed by fried-oyster sliders, bowls of shell-free mussels, and champagne cocktails galore. Catch selections change daily (like the Idaho red trout), but look for the halibut. Perfectly seared on the outside and snowwhite and flaky on the inside, it’s like crème brûlée of the sea."
