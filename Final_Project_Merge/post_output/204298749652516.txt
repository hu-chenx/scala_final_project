http://www.CapeCodPhoto.net, See the blizzard on Cape Cod from the heights of a resilient drone. I shot this today with spotter Richard Koury at 3:10pm at Chatham's Hardings Beach. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM3Ry9eTHoY, Cape Cod Blizzard Warning remains in effect until 7 PM EST this evening.

Locations: extreme Southeast Massachusetts including Cape Cod and the Islands. This includes the cities and towns of Brockton. Plymouth, Mattapoisett, Chatham, Falmouth. Provincetown. Vineyard Haven and Nantucket.
Hazard types: Heavy wet snow and strong winds will likely result in tree damage and scattered power outages. Strong winds and heavy snow will create Blizzard/white-out conditions at times.
Accumulations: snow accumulation of 8 to 12 inches along with localized higher amounts up to 14 inches possible.
Timing: snow will fall heavy at times through late afternoon. Snow intensity will begin to diminish by early evening, but localized bands of moderate to heavy snow may persist into the overnight hours.
Impacts: considerable falling and/or blowing and drifting snow. Visibilities will become poor with Whiteout conditions at times. Those venturing outdoors may become lost or disoriented. So persons in the warning area are advised to stay indoors. Heavy wet snow and strong winds will result in tree damage and scattered power outages.
Winds: northeast 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 60 mph.
Visibilities: one quarter mile or less at times.
Recommended actions
A Blizzard Warning is issued when sustained winds or frequent gusts over 35 mph are expected with considerable falling and/or blowing and drifting snow. Visibilities will become poor with Whiteout conditions at times. Those venturing outdoors may become lost or disoriented, so persons in the warning area are advised to stay indoors.
The original text for this alert has been automatically reformatted to correct capitalization.
ready.govTips from ready.gov
Before:
Before winter approaches, add the following supplies to your emergency kit:
Rock salt or more environmentally safe products to melt ice on walkways. Visit the Environmental Protection Agency for a complete list of recommended products.
Sand to improve traction.
Snow shovels and other snow removal equipment.
Sufficient heating fuel. You may become isolated in your home and regular fuel sources may be cut off. Store a good supply of dry, seasoned wood for your fireplace or wood-burning stove.
Adequate clothing and blankets to keep you warm.
More:
What to do before winter storms and extreme cold.
During:
Avoid overexertion when shoveling snow. Overexertion can bring on a heart attack - a major cause of death in the winter. If you must shovel snow, stretch before going outside.
Keep dry. Change wet clothing frequently to prevent a loss of body heat. Wet clothing loses all of its insulating value and transmits heat rapidly.
Watch for signs of frostbite. These include loss of feeling and white or pale appearance in extremities such as fingers, toes, ear lobes, and the tip of the nose. If symptoms are detected, get medical help immediately.
Conserve fuel, if necessary, by keeping your residence cooler than normal. Temporarily close off heat to some rooms.

By A J Orsini Lebeda • SEP 6, 2013
----
Christopher Seufert is a documentary film producer and photographer known equally for portraits, aerial shots, and landscapes. But he started his professional life as an archaeologist, specializing in the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on Native American populations. A deep love of Cape Cod is the theme that seems to connect all of Seufert's careers.

Have you always lived in Chatham?
I grew up in Chatham and spent most of my 20's and 30's away in San Francisco, Australia, New York City, and Boston.  I do love many towns on the rest of the Cape but like the convenience of being more centrally located here on the elbow. If practicality were no issue I'd live in the wilds of Wellfleet.

What inspired you to become an archaeologist? And why study climate change from that angle?
I did a semester abroad in Rome, Italy in college working for the city of Rome in the Roman forum as a conservateur on the Arch of Septimius Severus (A.D. 203). I loved the combination of the physical techniques we practiced in the field with the academic methods when we returned to the lab to digest findings and make sense of them for the general public. (Also, it's standard in Rome for workers to drink wine on lunch breaks on the scaffolding of a city project.) Then I graduated from Trinity College with a BA in Creative Writing. By then I had a strong on-the-job training as an archeologist that I used right away to work as a field technician for the National Park Service. After a brutal winter on the beach, I then decided to up my government pay rating by getting the next education level of training.

My master's thesis (which you can find in the Cape Cod library system or read online here https://www.worldcat.org/title/predictive-archaeological-model-chatham-ma-12000bp-450bp/oclc/39975195) was a predictive archaeological model of the town of Chatham, which showed where cultural resources (artifacts and human remains) were likely to appear in the present day landscape for the purpose of protecting them from disturbances like construction and utility projects. What resulted was a map that had few areas that one could subtract from consideration due to the fact that the town of Chatham was inhabited and utilized by Native Americans in many different ways over the course of the last 15,000 or so. This is primarily due to the effect of sea level rise. For example, what remains today in Chatham was once just hilltops over looking a vast plain, which is now underwater. Across this plain the paleo-indians could once walk to Nantucket. We are in fact a stage in between glacial periods, which means the earth is warming. If the past historic cycles hold true the earth will cool again and this cycle will be happening for millennia to come if we don't screw it up.

How did you get started on photography?
While I studied archaeology in the nineties I kept my hand in writing as a journalist, first in print and then in television. I worked for the now-defunct Cape 11 News Channel as a videographer. I used this video production experience in my graduate studies to produce documentaries that were distributed commercially to the educational market to colleges, grad programs, and places like the Massachusetts Historical Commission. My program demanded that we publish our work to places that were usable, not just in academia, but in the public realm. So my core media work was video, but my company, Mooncusser Films LLC is now multimedia, specializing broadly in video, photography, audio, and new media.  It's a business thing, you can't be too specialized here on Cape Cod yearround. There's a great convergence of media going on, as you can see when those NPR reporters are not just getting the story, but recording audio, and shooting video and photos, too.

My current photography book about the late Yarmouth illustrator Edward Gorey actually stems from a documentary that I shot with him before his death from 1996 to 2000. So the photography comes right out of my video background and is hard to separate. With that said, I love the potential immediacy of the one-shot and its ability to hit you at gut-level right away.

Do you still dabble in archaeology at all anymore?
I don't professional, but continue as an avocational archeologist. I've got my head down wherever I trek with my kids.  Walking the beaches and pulling up old pieces of ceramic and pharmacy bottles is one of our favorite things. My 3-year-old son, Ethan, and I found a Monomoyick sharpening stone on Goose Pond in 2009, the only one I know of in Chatham. The report is in process now at the Massachusetts Historical Commission. I also believe strongly in protecting archaeological remains from casual pot-hunting and construction projects.

Where did the idea for a documentary about Henry Beston come from?
The Henry Beston project is the brainchild of producer Don Wilding, who is the director of the Henry Beston Society in Eastham. We work very well together and I'm proud of the freedom he gives me to get the best footage possible.

I'm working as the director/editor of the project and help Don to break the feature-length project into small fundable sub-projects that we'll be streaming as webisodes. We'd love it if we can get PBS and/or NPR as distribution partners. We're shooting reenactment sequences with Sandwich actor Chris Kolb, who you'd swear was Beston himself.

What was it like to live - temporarily - in the historic dune shacks at Cape Cod National Seashore?
I've had four dune shack stays now, totaling six weeks at the Margo-Gelb, Fowler, and Ray Wells dune shacks. Time off the grid, pumping water by hand, hiking the wilds of the Provincelands, and swimming alone on Peaked Hill Beach helps to keep me grounded and sane. Having totally unstructured, unscheduled time to do whatever strikes you in the moment is a luxury few people get between childhood and retirement. And I am refreshed by reconnecting to the Cape in that way, remembering what it is that I love about this place.

If you're in New England you'll want to tune in tonight to Channel 5 (WCVB) Chronicle at 7:30 where the Edward Gorey documentary project will be featured on their Indie Showcase. I drove up to Needham, MA yesterday and did a big interview with them. 

http://www.wcvb.com/chronicle/tuesday-august-5-indie-showcase/27268006#!bwyLle

Please continue to tell all your friends and social networkers to help us raise finishing funds here https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/edward-gorey-documentary-project/x/5381300

We ended up actually taking home $45,000 of the $62,000 that was initially raised on Kickstarter, through fees and cancellations, but we're still coming up short on the budget for all the opportunities that have opened up for us. Our animations and music are budgeted at $15,000 and licensing from CBS at $22,000. Adding in lawyers fees and estate licensing you can see we're facing a shortage. Please keep spreading the word!

thanks,
Christopher Seufert, Director

1. The documentary has been covered with features by both the Boston Globe and the Cape Cod Times this week, stay tuned for links when they're published! 

2. We've also gotten distribution interest from Japan, Korea, Canada, and England and here domestically by Samuel Goldwyn Films and Sony Pictures Classics. Hopefully some of this will pan out! DVD/VOD distribution is pretty easy independently these days but theatrical distribution is a whole other animal...

3. Our core funding has been met thanks to you! With all of the exposure we have the opportunity to do more screenings, to do a more substantial 2-disc documentary soundtrack project (readings by Neil Gaiman?), to license more artwork from the estate, and overall to get the documentary out in front of more eyes upon release. Toward that end we've launched an IndieGoGo campaign to raise some of these stretch goals. If you missed being able to get some of the project rewards or to assist the project as you'd like here's the link https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/edward-gorey-documentary-project/x/5381300. If you don't see a reward there that you'd like message us there!

He's done documentaries with Edward Gorey, Suzanne Vega and Albert Maysles. He's worked on music videos for David Ryan of the Lemonades and Chris Trapper of the Push Stars. Julie Harris and Walter Cronkite have benefited from his recording technique. Look for his hard-bound photograph books and “The Cape Cod National Sea Shore and Guide” for a splendid display of his work.

----------
Inquiry: "Hi, can we use your beautiful photo for free in exchange for a credit (that we'd be legally responsible for as part of a paid job and is not a form of payment in itself?) Our whole dept. just loves your photography!"

Me: "Thanks for the compliment. Sure, please credit © Christopher Seufert Photography and link to http://www.CapeCodPhoto.net/" (Though I'd like to not respond, I've found it quicker to just answer instead of facing the dreaded repeat inquiry which then upgrades to a frantic phone call. They want your time and they're going to get it if you don't respond.)

Inquiry: "I found your photo on Flickr, can you email me the file according to the specs of our art department at 4200 pixels and 300 dpi?" (We're treating this as a professional job on our end, just not on yours.)

Me: "Actually I can't put time into it if it's unpaid, sorry. You're welcome to use my image as requested though, as I've uploaded it to Flickr at a full resolution that exceeds your specs and it's not watermarked. If you're logged in to Flickr you can download it by...." (now I'm doing tech support.)

Inquiry: "Can you tell us something about the image, how you shot it, and provide a caption?" (More time)

Me: "Sorry, no. Since It's unpaid I can't put my time into it, but you're welcome to use my image with the credit and link I provided initially."
---------
Remember, credit is not payment, it's a legal requirement. Should this type of inquiry be prepared to pay at least $50 for usage of an image that has been handpicked by them for their purpose since they don't want to use a generic stock photo for $5?

On Thursday, the 26th day of June, 1952, someone murdered Merle Pearl. Unaware of the danger that threatens their lives, Merle’s three daughters return home to Snake Hollow, a quirky, backwoods town in the Ozark mountains, to hunt the killer of their papa. Confusing messages from the townsfolk complicate their treacherous journey. The Pearls of Snake Hollow is a riveting, playful tale of good and evil, but you might not figure out which is which until the surprising climax. Phillips has caught the images of backwoods American existence and brought them to us shimmering in the half-light of wry humor, pathos, and a gentle humanity. The Pearls of Snake Hollow is metaphor and legend, reminiscent of the writing of Sharyn McCrumb at her best.” A rollicking read., For those of you interested in my Edward Gorey documentary I'll be on NPR's The Point with Mindy Todd and fellow guest Ken Morton from 9AM to 10AM on Thursday, February 27 discussing the film I shot with Gorey from 1996 to 2000 and what this amazing man was like in person. http://capeandislands.org/programs/point-wcai, I have an office for rent here in the building on Main Street in Chatham.

I'm riding the Last Gasp charity ride 62 miles across Cape Cod to benefit Lyme Disease awareness http://www.lymeticks.org/. In 2011, while shooting a photography book about the Cape Cod National Seashore I contracted Lyme Disease myself so this is a personal cause for me (Lyme-free after two years so far). My fundraising goal is to find 20 people to donate $100 each and raise at least $2500 for this under-recognized ailment.

Would you help? If you send me your mailing address after donating $100 or more I'll send you a signed copy of one of my two Cape Cod photography books "Cape Cod & Islands Reflections (Schiffer, 2010) or "The Cape Cod National Seashore: A Photographic Adventure & Guide" (Schiffer, 2012). If one of you will give $200 or more I'll ship you this 23 X 16" framed print of one of my most popular photographs "Sunrise in the Dunes". (Finished in beach-inspired white wood, signed and stamped with a certification by Narrowland Gallery on back.)

Podiatrist Frank Campo loves his top-floor two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in the historic North End neighborhood of Boston. In fact, is in the same 18th-century building as his office, which makes for a very short commute. His rooftop container garden is a relaxing haven from the hustle and bustle of city life, but he longs for a total escape. Fond memories of family vacations spent in Provincetown, a seaside community on the tip of Cape Cod, have spurred him to look for a vacation home there. Realtor Sam Hardee, a local, is eager to help Campo find the perfect place for weekend getaways.

"The Cape Cod National Seashore: A Photographic Adventure and Guide," Christopher Seufert (Schiffer, 112 pages, $24.99)

Chatham photographer Christopher Seufert has created six Cape Cod photo books, including "Cape Cod & Islands Reflections" and co-owns Narrowland Gallery in Chatham. He even leads photographic tours of the area. But if you want to know what Seufert sees with his lenses, sit down and spend time with this book. Many of the viewpoints are fresh, a real achievement on our much-photographed peninsula. Think you know the seashore? Maybe you do, but maybe you will see more on these pages.
