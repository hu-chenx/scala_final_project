We look forward to seeing our Boston Bruins fans AND our Buffalo Bills Backers of Boston! 

A message from the Bills: 

First and foremost we hope that all of your family and friends back in WNY are safe in what has been an unprecedented week for the region. While football is clearly secondary to the safety and health of all those dealing with the storm, we wanted to update you all on Monday’s game, and what we’re doing to try and help the effort back home.

I’m sure you’ve all heard by now, the game has been rescheduled for Monday night at 7pm. The Harp will have the game on all the regular TVs with audio.

Today the Detroit Lions announced they will be running a 50/50 raffle at the game to raise money for American Red Cross of Western and Central New York Disaster Relief Fund.

Here’s a link to the story: http://www.buffalobills.com/…/d94ae53f-e995-460e-88fa-fe543…

To help echo this support, we will have a bucket at the bar on Monday to collect money to donate to the fund. All money donated will go directly to the fund, so please come out and support a cause that is very near and dear to all our hearts.

A couple other things that will be unique to Monday that we wanted to share:
- There is a Bruins game at the garden Monday night, so the bar will be a little crowded pregame with Bruins fans. However they will all be clearing out just before kickoff. So if you show up and can’t get a table or spot at the bar, there should be plenty of space when the game starts.
- Labatt Blue Light pitchers will be available starting at kickoff! 

We look forward to seeing you all at the Harp on Monday, and we wish you all safe travels this week, and hope you enjoy a very Happy Thanksgiving!

Go Bills,
