List(We are so pleased to team up again this year with the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project for a very special annual tradition at Bondir. It is the New Entry Spring Fundraising Dinner. This event raises much needed funds for low-income food access programming. Last year, funds raised at the dinner helped New Entry to leverage over $80,000 in fresh fruits and vegetables grown by beginning and other farmers to distribute through senior centers, community health centers, homeless shelters, nutrition education programs and more.  We hope you will consider purchasing a ticket. http://nesfp.org/events/2016-new-entry-dinner, null, We'll be open Easter Sunday from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM. We will offer a special Easter Brunch menu. We hope you can join us! Reservations are highly recommended.

Last year around this time. Prepping for our annual Robert Burns Night! 

Some reservations are still available for this year's event. 
Menu & details are available here: http://bit.ly/1RRj0fi, Tonight's bread is Turkey Red Whole Wheat Sourdough.
And, here are some interesting facts about "Turkey Red" with thanks to Slow Food USA 

"This particular variety can be traced to Crimea between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the early 19th century and earlier to Turkey to the south of the Black Sea. Mennonite immigrants brought it to the United States in the early 1870s, introducing it to the areas surrounding Marian, Reno and Harvey Counties in Kansas. It became the dominant hard red winter wheat in Kansas and much of the Great Plains bread basket and was the major hard winter variety in the 1920s. Significant acreage was planted in Kansas until the mid-1940s when it was replaced with modern higher-yielding cultivars." 

#Kansas #Wheat #WinterWheat

Bondir Concord Menu: http://www.bondirconcord.com/dinner/, We like this trend!

"Grains such as #rye, #spelt, and #triticale will continue to infiltrate restaurant menus for varied texture, flavor, and heft. ‚ÄúI think there is a whole new wave of gluten coming,‚Äù says  Oleana Restaurant‚Äôs Ana Sortun......She favors grains from Northfield-based Four Star Farms, Inc......At Bondir, Jason Bond uses the ancient Mesoamerican technique of #nixtamalization to process his own red flint corn, grown in Concord. He then incorporates it into bread and corn caramels.", "You powers, who make mankind your care,
And dish them out their bill of fare,
Old Scotland wants no watery stuff,
That splashes in small wooden dishes;
But if you wish her grateful prayer, 
Give her [Scotland] a Haggis!"
- From "Address to a Haggis" by Robert Burns

We invite you to join us in Concord for Burns Night two weeks from tonight!, #BondirConcordLunch might be the best cure for a rainy afternoon!

#sustainable #ConcordMa

"All our activities at Hutchins Farm are informed by a profound respect for the land, the people who work the land, and our community of customers. Our commitment to sustainability is threefold‚Äîa desire to sustain ourselves and those who work with us with a vibrant, viable economic enterprise; to sustain the land we cultivate through responsible practices and a sense of stewardship; to sustain our customers by growing and selling only the freshest, most flavorful, most healthful produce available. We hope and trust that our commitment will serve, in some way, to help sustain the larger communities to which we belong."

http://www.hutchinsfarm.com/, What are ways people who are nervous in the kitchen can overcome their anxiety?

Chef Bond: "Just keep doing it. Try each recipe a couple of times. You‚Äôll start to notice how you get a lot faster with practice."
 
What‚Äôs your #1 tip for home cooks?

Chef Bond: "Learn one classic recipe, and how to vary it. For instance, learn a pumpkin soup recipe, and then switch out the produce, like swapping out zucchini during the summer time. Streamline how much you have to know to produce a good meal."

Check out Chef Bond's full interview with Plated below . .

 "What is a truckle? In the old English Language a Truckle means cylinder shape. Traditionally, Old World Cheddars are formed in truckles.
 Milton Creamery worked hand-in-hand with the Flory Family of Jamesport, Missouri to develop this aged clothbound cheddar.
 Instead of aging it in plastic, this cheese ages with the cheesecloth left on the outside, allowed to dry for ten days, then coated with lard to minimize mold penetration, and aged twelve month. The cloth allows the cheese to breathe resulting in a dry, crumbly texture.", We're getting in the Robert Burns Night spirit in advance of next Tuesday's dinner!

The holiday peaked with the burning of an enormous log whose purpose was to ward off the darkness, both literal and figurative, associated with winter. The burning of the Yule log is one of many pre-Christian rituals incorporated into Christmas celebrations across Europe. But by the late 19th century in France, as smaller stoves replaced large hearths, the tradition had all but faded. Soon enough, the confectionery version of the Yule log emerged to fill the void."- Saveur
