SATURDAY, MAY 17TH  at 8pm we will be sharing an evening of 9 COURSES of top culinary dishes prepared by Executive Chef Rachid Kourda. 

How It Works:
-This dinner will sell out fast - Those who reply after seats have been filled will be placed on the waiting list for cancellations and will have first choice in seating for the next event.

-Reservations will be honored on a first reply basis. 
Please contact Executive Chef Rachid Kourda. Email (chef@rachidkourda.com) or text 617.407.1277 with your name, phone number and the number in your party. You will be contacted and asked to reserve your seat with a credit card number. Cancellations will be honored 72 hours prior to the event and will be refunded in full or you can change your reservation to the next event.

—Donation for this Event is $100, $120 or $150 which includes food and specialty cocktails with every course and limo service. Gratuity for the servers is not included.

—Beer and wine or any cocktail of your choice- BYOB 

-Limo Service On the House 
The limo will pick you up and bring you to the unknown underground dinner location. At the end of the event, the limo will also bring you home. We don’t want you to drink and drive.
Gratuity for the limo is not included.

—The limo will be taking two rounds of 10 people. Therefore, if you arrive in the first trip, small bites and cocktails will be served on the table. As soon as the second trip arrives, the first course will be served.

—The underground dinner will be held in a secrete space. You will be given the time you will be picked up 48 hours prior to the event. Pick up times vary depending on your location and could be as early as 5:30pm if you live 20 miles from the location. 

Cheers! We can’t wait to see you.
