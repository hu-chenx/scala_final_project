Together, we mourn Baylee's passing. #TimpviewHighSchool #Provo #ForeverAQueen, Let's put a stop to this kind of crime in our schools and communities! Follow my foundation for more info. I call upon adults and youth in Provo, Glens Falls, and nationwide to adopt a 'say no to nudes' policy and to read the statement below. #StopChildPornography #FredetteFamilyFoundation #Jimmerosity 

The Fredette Family Foundation stands against child pornography. It is a serious crime. Let's do all we can to educate our children about its dangers, in and out of school. A note from our President:

"In the wake of the Jared Fogle case ruling, it is an opportune time to discuss an issue we have been aware of for a while and is currently reaching epidemic proportions, affecting our schools and communities: child pornography.

Child pornography is a serious mistake and a crime in our society. 

Recent research has shown that 50 to 75 percent of boys and girls in high schools have distributed, received, requested, or been exposed to "nudes" from someone in their school. In many cases, once it is received it is used as leverage or power to get sexual favors or as means of bullying or harassment.

As one social worker recently said to me, "It is the 'norm' for guys or girls to ask for a 'nude' when they begin dating."

Legally (dependent on state law), it is a class B misdemeanor under 16, class A misdemeanor ages 16-17, and a felony for anyone 18+ to receive, distribute, or request any pornographic image from a minor (Utah). 

Please help us spread the word and educate your child about this growing epidemic affecting our youth, our families, and our communities.

Sincerely,

J. Blair Giles
