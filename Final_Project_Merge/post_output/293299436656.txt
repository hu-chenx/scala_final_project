Using non-toxic products is super important for me, because I have sensitive acne prone skin. Did you know that over 1,400 chemicals are used in beauty products in the US vs. a mere 11 in the EU? In America, the beauty industry is highly unregulated. These chemicals are carcinogenic, and can disrupt the endocrine system causing hormonal imbalances. All the more reason to buy high quality non-toxic skin care products.

Then… https://t.co/lKltQAafNL, Not only is it important to eat consciously, it's also important to realize what you're putting on your skin, and use safe non-toxic products. Your skin is your largest organ and it absorbs everything. Harsh chemicals that are toxic have been linked to hormonal imbalances, skin irritants and are highly carcinogenic. 

I've recently began using Beautycounter's skincare products and makeup and I've fallen in love. Not only are they toxic free but they emphasize on not using the 1,400 chemicals that have already been banned in Europe. In American, only 11 of these toxic chemicals have been banned. Scary isn't it? 

This industry is highly unregulated. There is no pre-product approval before a product hits the market and enters your home.

Beautycounter has been rated by Elle magazine as one of the top three trends to look out for, because their products are really looking out for you.

, My whole healthy bowl was filled with fresh strawberries this morning! Don't you just love the taste of real freshly picked strawberries! They just don't compare to the ones you usually buy in stores! I found these sweet gems at my farmers market down the street, and yes they are a bit more pricey, but they are so worth it with their sweet juicy strawberry flavor! 

What tasty items do you buy at your farmers market?, Spread the love.., Have you been eating any of these harmful foods? It might explain a lot! , Looking for ways to boost your metabolism? , It's all about balance. Health shouldn't be something you beat yourself up about in order to achieve what you see as the "perfect" body. It should allow you to have fun with it, be creative in your food choices and workouts, begin a new hobby like yoga or tennis, and create a positive relationship with yourself. 

Don't get down on yourself. Motivate yourself and be proud of what you are trying to achieve. Enjoy the process and realize that health is an outlook on life internally and externally, and it's never far from your reach!, Im loving this article! These dairy claims are what we are taught to believe and they are just not true. Its misinformation that society has become accustomed to. Dairy has become a controversial topic lately, because people are realizing its not as beneficial as we once thought. Its also highly promoted and marketed because its such a profitable industry. , My goodies from the local farmers market! Grown organically in upstate New York! So fresh and nourishing! Can't wait to cook tonight! Can you guess what I'll be making? (Don't worry the chocolate won't be included in the dish ;) hehe), Oh so creamy banana maple cinnamon oatmeal. Not surrounded by my usual topping assortment so opted for some fresh strawberries, sliced banana, and walnuts. Not too shabby! 

P.S. I have a question for you all. Did you ever think that eating "healthy" was boring or just didn't taste good? I've been thinking about how much my eating habits have changed the more I've learned about nutrition. I feel like people who make an effort to eat in order to nourish our bodies sometimes get a bad rep of the food not tasting good. Maybe someone just had a bad experience or just isn't used to the food yet, because eating whole foods tastes so good especially when freshly picked and organic!

 I just wish everyone could taste the wholesomeness and amazing natural flavors! I wish that there weren't options of organic produce and the more affordable "standard" produce. I wish that every eating option out there to buy was good for our bodies and not harmful, so that any choice anyone made would be a healthy and beneficial one. The fact that we have to be so conscious and aware of what is being added to our food scares me, because many people aren't aware and just don't realize how life threatening some products are. That's not their fault either, it's our FDA's job to regulate the food industry and enforce edible food that doesn't make us sick. Just wish they were doing their job! What do you all think?, Your skin is the largest organ of your body. What it absorbs matters. Be aware of these 4 skin care ingredients.

Have a hard time figure out what diet would work best for your needs? Read my new blog post to figure out what would work best for you! , After reading this informative article about harmful additives in make-up, it worries and saddens me that it is allowed and known that the public is being exposed to many harmful chemical additives every day. In food, makeup, water, cleaning supplies, and just about anything else. 

Our skin is a protectant shield and is also our body's largest organ. It absorbs all of the foreign man-made chemicals which are known to have harmful and even deadly effects. With increased cancer rates and other immune deficient diseases increasing every year, we have to consciously make decisions about what will harm our bodies, our vessels in life. 

The fact that the FDA has knowledge of and allows for these carcinogenic additives to be put in products we consume and use everyday, disgusts me. I hope we can all become more aware, and the more we show concern towards these issues, the more they are likely to change. , It's the weekend.

With a hint of lemon, maple syrup, and vanilla, this tastes like blueberry pie.

It's a thickener binder thats added to many dairy products like ice cream and yogurt, as well as deli meat.

If your liver isn't functioning properly, then your body won't be able to break down what you've digested properly and will store the excess nutrients as fat. 

Dandelion has been shown to improve liver function by removing toxins and reestablishing hydration and electrolyte balance. This in turn promotes weight loss. 

Think of your liver as a sift. If it's clogged with bad nutrients (from processed and refined foods) it won't be able to sift properly, the bad nutrients from the good.

What do you like to drink in the morning?, I've been studying in my health and wellness course how your digestive system is extremely important to take care of. It makes up 70% of your body and if you have an unhealthy gut, it can effect your skin, energy, bloating, stomach pain and so much more. I've started taking high quality probiotics to keep the healthy bacteria intact and prevent bad bacteria from taking over.
