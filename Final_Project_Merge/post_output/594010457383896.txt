List(Hey There, Boston geeks and gamers! If you haven't already been gleefully skipping around at the advent of PAX East 2016 next month, get hype! The Portal Team will be among the army of enthusiastic con-goers and epic cosplays, reppin' the future of gaming here in Boston! So be sure to stop us and say hello!

And as if that wasn't enough, we'd like to give you something else to get excited about! From now until the very end of PAX weekend, Portal will be hosting a game system giveaway! For free! Just like the page (if you haven't already), and comment on this post with a quote from your favorite video game character (extra points if it's pre-PS2/Xbox era!) to be entered to win a game system of your choice! In addition, Portal will be in attendance at our favorite local gaming event pre-PAX, Game Over (as always), which will take place prior to the con on Tuesday the 19th. We will be facilitating giveaway entry, with an added twist! Partnering with our friends at Moulah, additional entries will be purchasable, and through the Moulah app, leave your cash behind and pay via Moulah for a chance to win special Portal swag. (Currently only available for iOS users).

Good luck, and hope to see many of you soon!
- Portal Team, Any Bostonian gamers out there that can relate? We sure hope so!, More interesting news to break in the new year - apparently, table-toppers make better people!

In a study conducted by American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, two measurement scales were used to assess qualities exhibited by 127 gamers, the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index, (measuring empathy), and the Tellegen Absorption Scale, (measuring information retention). The results found that those who played games that incorporated elements of comradery and teamwork in their sessions develop the necessary social skills to relate to one another, and the imagination to hypothesize what it's like to be in someone else's position, whether slaying a dragon or having a bad day.

This just reinforces Portal's desire to bring to Boston a place where you can let your geek flag fly high! #gamerpride, Crazy gaming news to break in the new year! Terry Garrett, an engineering student at the University of Colorado, finished a task he set forth to complete in 2011, finishing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. While this may not sound impressive for those of us familiar with the classic N64 RPG, there is one caveat: Terry is blind.

That's right. Relying heavily on audio queues, this dedicated gamer pushed past all conceivable boundaries to beat one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time, certainly one of our favorites here at Portal. We've linked the video of Terry finishing off with the epic fight against Ganon, if you guys are curious to see how he did it it! (Hint: it requires pretty integral use of Save States!), Portal eSports News: Former Celtics Small Forward Rick Fox drops $1 million on the purchase of professional NA League of Legends team Gravity Gaming, formerly Curse Academy and to be yet again renamed Echo Fox, marking one of the first major capital purchases in eSports, and surfacing mainstream recognition of video games as not only a professional realm, but a money maker worth investing in!

Who's excited to see the future of pro gaming unfold?!, * Portal News Update! *

Our first Kickstarter initiative, one of many future opportunities to get involved with making Portal a reality in Boston, has come to a close! Though we didn't make our goal, we are very excited to make connections with Boston's geeks and gamers, and use what we've learned to improve our approach in bringing Portal to life! Rest assured, we're on it, and plan to make some big announcements very soon!

What can you do to help in the interim, you ask? Spread the word! If you know anyone who would appreciate Portal's goal to create an epic new nightlife destination with gamers in mind, invite them to like the page, and be a part of the ongoing conversation!

We appreciate all the support, and look forward to getting this show on the road!

Thankful and excited,
The Portal Team, Exiting news! Take-Two Interactive, with its recent acquisition of the Boston-based Irrational Games (responsible for the Bioshock series), has hinted at the development of a new open/semi-open world, narrative FPS, assumably similar to Borderlands or Shadows of Mordor, set in a scifi universe. The guys and gals at Portal can't help but wonder if it will take on the shape of something like the 2007 FASA Studio release of Shadowrun, which utilized a Counterstrike-esque buy system to acquire weapons, and spells, in a team-based, multiplayer-only frag fest, but unfortunately lacked any kind of campaign - perhaps a mistake Take-Two won't repeat!

We want to hear what you think, Boston! Would you welcome the next Destiny? Is there room for a new FPS? We think the future of gaming is exciting, and you should too!, How do Boston gamers feel about the new FFVII? Since the trailer hit yesterday, The Portal Team has been debating furiously amongst ourselves - some saying they like the life the new deviations from the original bring to the game, other more...purist team members feeling like they are doing the original a disservice. Check out the trailer and let us know what you think!, As we approach the last leg of our Kickstarter campaign with just 10 days remaining, we want to thank everyone who has reached out to us in support of The Portal Project. We've thoroughly enjoyed meeting all you Bostonian game enthusiasts, and regardless of the outcome of this first-of-many crowdfunding opportunities to come, we are rolling full steam ahead to bring Portal to Boston!

If you haven't yet and would like to pledge support via Kickstarter, now would be the time! Even if our goal is not met, we'd love to see the community get involved, and be able to connect with those of you who are just as passionate as we are to make this happen asap! Any questions or concerns can be raised via Kickstarter, a private message here, or through email @ portalgamebar@gmail.com. Thanks for your continued support!

Gratefully,
The Portal Team
