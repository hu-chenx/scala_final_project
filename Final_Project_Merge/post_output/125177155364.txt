List(Sadly, the rumors are true. Church, the venue and not the restaurant, has closed. We thank all of our loyal guests and performing artists for what they have contributed over the years.

The music scene and the City of Boston have changed dramatically over the better part of the last decade. Church is happy to have made a contribution to both the industry and the surrounding community. 

As Dylan said,  "the times they are a changing". We will dim the lights and power down the board allowing others to blaze the path into the new music generation.

Please keep your ear to the ground and listen for news on a going away show to end an era.

See you all on the flip side.
