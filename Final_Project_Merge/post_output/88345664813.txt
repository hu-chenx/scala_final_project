Hi! For my AP Literature project, we have to create something to represent our meaning of life. My own personal meaning of life is making others happy, more confident, and spreading love and positivity. I’d like to do this project through my Facebook page I just made, “Beyoutiful”. I have less than a month to do this project and I’d like to get over 100 “likes” before I present to the class. I was wondering if you'd like my page and if you could, can you click “invite friends” on the Facebook page and invite all of your friends on your friends list? that would mean so much to me!! I would really love to hit way over 100 likes but that's a start!! Thank you!! https://www.facebook.com/youarebeayoutiful, TLS Photography is looking for senior models for the Class of 2016 from the following schools!

If you don't have time to send them out for professional printing, most CVS locations can print a decent photo. If you have time to send out your pictures I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Nations Lab  Here is a link to their website!, Editing....Editing ...Editing!!!, It's funny when editing sibling pictures how the camera always seems to capture a pinch or a tag of the ear that I don't catch at the time! Got to love kids!! :), I have a few sessions available at The Jenney Grist Mill in Plymouth  tomorrow for my $25 Special for Father's Day if anyone would like to jump on board!!!

Be sure to tell your friends and family!, I'm so excited how nicely my portfolio is coming together with the help of so many mom's from here! I have a few specific ideas that I'd like to include in my portfolio and hoping someone here will fit the bill or maybe know someone who does! 
Here is a list of what I'm hoping to add to my portfolio. 
1)All girl sibling group of 3 or more children ages 5 and over
2)All boy sibling group of 3 or more children ages 5 and over
