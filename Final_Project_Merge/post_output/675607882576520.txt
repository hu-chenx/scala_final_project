Tip#4: Finish your steak in a 375-degree oven.

Tip #2: Invest in a cast iron, thick bottom sauté pan. Grilling outside is always more fun but a pan seared sirloin or rib eye can taste the best. Let the meat sit for 30 minutes before you start to cook. It will cook much more evenly when started at room temperature., Don't miss our 3-course lunch Monday-Friday for $25.00 per person!
