When cooking pasta, always use about 1 tablespoon of salt to 1 litre of water and have the water at a rapid boil - it’s important to cook pasta in an abundance of water so that it has room to move. Always conserve a little of the pasta water for adding into your pasta sauces as the starches from the pasta helps to give the sauce a little more substance in covering the pasta., null, Special for NYE Ossobucco !!!!, Happy Holidays
