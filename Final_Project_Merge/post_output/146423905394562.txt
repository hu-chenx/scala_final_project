, LEMONS: A Lemon a Day Keeps the Toxins Away

Drinking a glass of water with lemon every morning helps detoxify the liver.  It also balances alkaline levels and restores pH.

Vitamin C pumps up your immune system and helps prevent colds.

Lemons contain 22 anti-cancer compounds.

The beauty benefits alone are astounding : Prevents formation of wrinkles, fights acne, lightens dark spots, whitens teeth, rids you of oily skin, strengthen nails, calm dry scalp, and soothe chapped lips., Yummy Fresh Fruit Paletas are on their way soon!, BELL PEPPERS: The Christmas Ornament of the Vegetable World

1 Cup of Peppers = 45 calories and gives you more than your DV% of Vitamin A + C

Did you know that green and purple bell peppers tend to be more bitter, while red, orange, yellow tend to be sweeter?

Bell peppers are a very nutrient dense vegetable containing vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and antioxidants.  They are also an excellent source of beta-carotene, vitamin K, thiamine, folic acid, and vitamin B6.

Red bell peppers contain lycopene, a carotene that offers protection against cancer and heart disease.

Bell peppers contain substances, including capsaicin, flavonoids, and vitamin C, which have been shown to prevent blood clot formation and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Taste the rainbow!, CHERRIES: An often over-looked superfood
Battles Belly Fat: A cup of cherries is less than 100 calories and packs in 3 grams of fiber, which will keep you feeling full longer. Also, these little beauties contain many B-vitamins such as thiamin, riboflavin and vitamin B6; these vitamins are crucial for metabolism and convert nutrients into energy.

Help Reduce Blood Pressure: Cherries are an excellent source of potassium, which helps to lower blood pressure by getting rid of the excess sodium in our body. Eating cherries helps keep potassium and sodium in balance, and can prevent hypertension from occurring. One cup of cherries has the same amount of potassium as a banana making it a great substitute when you are not in the mood for another ho-hum banana.

Help you Sleep: If sipping a cup of chamomile isn‚Äôt enough to induce restful sleep try having tart cherry juice before bed. Tart cherries contain melatonin, a hormone that helps make you feel sleepy. Two tablespoons of tart cherry juice has been shown in studies to be just as effective as a melatonin supplement. So, pour yourself a little cherry juice nightcap for a tasty bedtime sleep aid.

Ease Muscle Soreness: Combat post workout soreness and reduce muscle inflammation with tart cherry juice.  Runners who downed 24 ounces of tart cherry juice daily for seven days before a long-distance race, and again on race day, reported fewer aches afterward. 

Not only that, but these tart red gems will help fight heart disease, drop cholesterol, lower diabetes, balance blood sugar, and provide osteoarthritis relief., A huge thank you to Boston Magazine for featuring PRESSED!
