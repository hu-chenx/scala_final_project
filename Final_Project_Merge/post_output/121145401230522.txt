She told me as much as she could about the building and all it cost me was the promise of a mousse au chocolate! #igotthebetterdeal! #bakinghistory :@ricaborich, SUCCESS! After much coaxing from my host the woman next door let me see the interior of the baking house. Her father was the last to use it- he baked one type of bread. It took many hours and much skill to get the fire to the right temperature and bake the bread for the right amount of time. So amazing to see this piece of baking history! :@ricaborich, #blueberrycrumble #piebakerinfrance :@ricaborich, #pielove #piebakerinfrance #blueberrycrumble :@ricaborich, This is the man with the best honey in the Limousin region! #sweetchestnuthoney #bees #pielove #piebakerinfrance :@ricaborich, Blueberries from the market in Treignac! #timeforpie #piebakerinfrance :@ricaborich, Plums in Montignac #pielove :@ricaborich, And of course- a swim in the river! #prehistoricwaters #pielove :@ricaborich, After visiting the Lascaux caves we try the dessert named after them from the #patisserie... rich buttercream sandwiched between two soft meringues

Our library cafe is where you want to be. #librarylunch #pieatthelibrary, Brooklyn Based gives a big shout out to our favorite Brooklyn Bike shop BICYCLE STATION!  171 Park Ave. (at Adelphi St.)

"Bicycle Station: Keep this place in mind next time you’re cruising along the bike paths on Flushing Ave. and get a flat. It’s really the only bike store along the waterfront from Williamsburg to Dumbo that doesn’t require much re-routing to get to. Located close by the BQE, on the corner of Park Ave. and Adelphi, Bicycle Station is owned and operated by Mike Rodriguez who has 30-plus years of experience repairing bikes. It’s not very often that you go to a bike shop and deal directly with its owner, but every time I’ve taken my bike to Bicycle Station, Rodriguez has handled my repairs himself. He’s a native Brooklynite who used to race bikes, and he takes a lot of pride in his products and repairs–he’s also very knowledgeable about bikes in general. I always feel comfortable taking my bike into his shop. His prices are very reasonable for repairs and his turn-around time is short. Bicycle Station, 171 Park Ave. (at Adelphi St.), Wallabout 718-638-0300 –JG"

PLEASE SUPPORT The Pass It On Project – named for the program which it documents – this documentary follows a group of eighth grade students and their two teachers on a road trip through the south to learn about the Civil Rights Movement from some of the Movement surviving leaders. The film is part coming-of-age story, part historical document, but more significantly it is a tool for encouraging a dialogue about race and history, and for inspiring teachers and young people to participate in social justice education and activism of their own.
