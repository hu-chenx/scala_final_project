Every new rider, every new studio and every new SOUL staffer who joins our movement is such an inspiration. As the year comes to a close, we want to thank YOU for being a part of our communities and for spreading joy, love and fitness in a world that needs it more than ever.

Last December, we started a new holiday tradition at SoulCycle: We launched a national SoulScholarship initiative committed to providing teens from underserved communities the opportunity to ride as part of our pack as well as mentorship, nutrition counseling and workshops on career preparation and job readiness. Today we’re thrilled to be able to share a small window into the work we’ve been doing.

This work could not have been possible without you. What truly makes a difference for our SoulScholars is being a part of this dedicated community that empowers and nurtures all of us. Thank you for warmly welcoming these Scholars into our studios, for sharing your feedback, and for inspiring us to continue to grow the program.

In 2016, we hope to launch SoulScholarship in L.A., Washington, D.C. and Chicago, and we plan to reach more teens every year. With the gift of movement, we're changing the lives of these SoulScholars together. You can learn more about the program here: http://bit.ly/soulscholarship

But when you ride with Soul Instructor LINDSAY WAXER, the combination makes sense. A childlike joy comes through Lindsay's classes -- her energy palpable, smile beaming. So it's not so surprising that this 80s-loving, PJ-wearing, energetic instructor makes you feel like a kid again too.

But her ambitions run deeper than a dance party. Isabel wants to empower her riders through her class, teaching them, "It's not about being thin, but being confident."

Such great energy!, Happy Birthday, Lauren Goldberg!!, Although Soul Instructor BEN TURSHEN is brand new to the early morning circuit, he already has a lot in common with the Rooster crowd. A lawyer-turned-instructor, Ben knows a thing or two about juggling work and workouts. And when he leads the pack with the no-nonsense intensity often used to describe a typical Rooster, we know he's gonna fit right in.
, With unpleasant memories of early morning car rides, MIREYA D'ANGELO has never considered herself a morning person. But the Soul Roosters have given her a new reason to rise before the sun. And the energy in her class has given us a reason to rise right along with her! , Soul Rooster MARY HAWKINS brings up another good reason to workout in the morning: the feeling of accomplishment before the rest of the world is even awake. Ask yourself - what did you do before 7AM today? , When Jenny taught the 4PM in USQ and Jason taught the 5PM, they discovered they had something in common..., ANDREW VOGEL makes a good point: you should sign-up for Rooster classes, rather than walk into them. When you've made a commitment and paid for the class then you're less likely to press that snooze button. Plus, with the Rooster following growing, that might be the only way you get a bike!, For MELISSA IORIO, Soul Rooster classes are not just about fitting rides in early, but also about the community you find when you get there. We couldn't be more pleased to have Melissa as a member of the Soul Family. And Melissa, since we're family now, we hope you don't mind that we're planning on stealing your Rooster quote. , A SERIOUSLY impressive Soul cake that Lisa Gans made for her sister, Stacey Phillips!, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, At SoulCycle our Thanksgiving tradition is our 90-minute Turkey Burns, celebrating our strong bodies and remembering all we have to be grateful for. But it got us wondering what other people do on Thanksgiving. We asked a few instructors about their traditions and were shocked by the varied responses... this day is NOT just about eating turkey! What are your Thanksgiving traditions??, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, Soul Instructor KAILI STEVENS is yet another Rooster convert. The energy of this amazing pack pulled her in and took her right back to the intensity of her college volleyball days. And as it turns out, Kaili's class - one part hardcore and one part club - is a cocktail we'd like to drink every morning. , SOULCYCLE IS HIRING FOR ROSLYN, L.I.!, IFFIE AITKENHEAD, Rooster extraordinaire, wrote what is perhaps the most inspiring description of Soul Roosters to date (make sure you read the whole post!). This Thanksgiving, we're so grateful to have such inspiring riders.  , null, null, null, null, null, null, This picture of JONATHAN KLEISNER says everything you need to know about the Roosters: fit, determined, hardcore. And in typical guy fashion, Jonathan's description of the morning pack cuts right to the chase: "Roosters Rock." We'd have to agree. , Soul Instructor LOUISE GASSMAN is literally hardwired to teach the Roosters. As someone who - literally - jumps out of bed, no one is better equipped to wake our Souls up and work them out before the sun rises!, null, null, null, null, The Soul Rooster game changed when STACEY GRIFFITH joined the team. Bringing her motivational style and party energy to the earliest AM classes made us rethink what a Rooster class could be. Not familiar with Stacey's ride? Just read the post... you'll see what we mean., Instructors, you better watch out for Soul Rooster JAMIE ANGEN -- if your class doesn't kick booty first thing in the morning, she won't consider it a true Rooster class! A mother of two with a full-time job, Jamie needs to those AM classes to pack a punch. And based on her devotion to the Roosters, seems like they do! , Team SC: Congrats to Sarah Grossbart and Mara Reinstein who completed a half marathon last weekend in SC gear!, SC Instructor ELLEN ABRAHAM just recently joined the Rooster circuit. And while pre-dawn classes may not have been her first choice, her riders have convinced her otherwise. With three extra hours to her day and extra energy from a strong pack of riders, Ellen is yet another convert to the Rooster way of life! , If JACKIE KERN isn't a walking ad for morning classes, we don't know who is. An "executive mom" who started a non profit, she still has energy for (or maybe gets her energy from) dancing on a bike before 7am. Thinking about setting your alarm early yet? We thought so. , Soul instructor RIQUE URESTI is new to the Rooster circuit. Although he's a self-proclaimed "evening person," Rique says it's worth getting up extra early for his morning riders. We say give it another month and Rique will be waking before dawn on his days off! , SoulCycle owes a huge thank you to GLYNIS KARP for helping to create the Soul Roosters. What started out as just a few riders has now turned into a full-blown Soul phenomenon. And Glynis is still leading the pack. , Happy Birthday Marisa Pizarro!

Bike messengers from around the US came to race on a motorcycle track with sections of mud and off-the-bike tire obstacles. As usual, Kym rocked it out -- evidenced by photos on the Soul blog!, If you're looking for your daily dose of inspiration, look no further than this video of Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Speech in which he muses on the importance of recognizing your own mortality.

From transforming our PR, to organizing Soul events (down to the last detail), to planning photoshoots, to starting our social media, to running our customer service, to making staff shirts, to arranging flowers... there is not one part of Soul that Amy Peck has not improved. And on top of that, she is a dream to work with. Enthusiastic, thoughtful, generous, hilarious -- to know her it to love her. Here's to you, Amy Peck. , Check out KYM PERFETTO in this Fashion Week Video!!, It seems only appropriate to wrap-up the Originals series with this post from MELANIE GRIFFITH.

Reading more like a poem than a q + a, Tara's writing reflects the kind of rider she is: strong and soulful. Thank you for everything you have given to Soul throughout the years... See you at 77th!, Daria Eriksson's son signing in for her!, It seems appropriate to follow up Pamela Murphy's post with a q+a from SC Original GABRIELLE PALAY (here they are pictured together as kids)! Thank you Gabrielle for your calm energy and wicked sense of humor. Can't wait to ride with you 5 blocks away! , SC Original PAMELA MURPHY has to be one of the most kind and generous Souls we know.

All we can say is THANK YOU!, null, SC Original SILDA PALERM was one of the first to discover what so many of us have since found at Soul -- the ability to find  joy in fitness. As she describes it, "We ride hard and we have a good time doing it."  Looking forward to continuing the good times. Thank you, Silda! , Another rider who has literally been with us since day one, SC Original DEBBIE SABLE truly helped start the Soul revolution. And the addiction runs in the family. With her daughter Elianna now rocking the instructor bike, it looks like the Sables will be riding at 77th for a long time to come!! , We often call what happens in our little room "life practice" - the way you face a challenge on the bike reflects how you'll approach a challenge outside of class. No one understands this better than SC Original JODI DIVAK who says that SoulCycle has helped her take on new obstacles. And based on the way she rides, we're gonna bet she faces them head on! , One of our first male addicts, SC Original STEVE DANTUS has some wonderful anecdotes about his first weeks at Soul. Steve compares W 72nd closing to finishing a good book. And we can't wait to write you into the sequel. Thank you, Steve! , If 72nd named a poster child, it would have to be LAUREN CECERE. The 1st time you come to Soul, Lauren will set you up and be sure to ask about your ride when you're done. The 2nd time you come she'll remember your name, the name of your grandmother and the name of your pet guinea pig. You may wonder, "Is this an act?" But it is NOT... Lauren is genuinely happy to see you! She has helped us to define what makes good customer service and Soul would not be the same without her! , Soul Sanctuary. Spinagogue. Therapy. These are all words that SC Original BERNA BARSHAY uses in her pitch-perfect description of the Soul experience. This girl gets it. Thank you, Berna. Can't wait to let the good times roll at 77th! , SC rider and teacher, Beth Clark, has a student who drew this. "Ms. Clark ride her bike fast." Yeah she does. And the wheels are spot on., If you've ridden with Stacey Griffith, you may have heard her reference the Mommy Ninjas -- normal moms who have secret lives as butt-kicking powerhouses (i.e. SoulCyclists). SC Original ANGELA DIGAETANO was certainly one of our first Mommy Ninjas and never ceases to amaze us with her dedication to riding. Thank you, Angela!, If anyone can call themselves a true SC original, it's MELISSA SPOHLER... she rode in SoulCycle's very first class! And since then Melissa has given back to Soul in countless ways: from rocking it out with that curly head of hair to designing our Soul Mantra necklaces. She also has a Soul memory you won't want to miss!, If you've taken class with SCOTT ELIAS, you know it. You know it because most likely about halfway through class you heard a bloodcurdling battlecry from the back of the room. At first it might scare you, but these yells are so full of joy and motivation that the people who ride with Scott have come to delight in them.  Love Scott, love the entire Elias clan, love this post!!! , JO JO GRAHAM was not only an original rider, she was one of Soul's first employees! For three years, Jo Jo was the first person to greet you on your walk down that long hallway and no one was more welcoming. She worked tirelessly setting up new riders, lighting candles and sleeping in the Barn that first summer to make sure the Bridgehampton studio ran smoothly. Even though Jo Jo's moved back to Ohio (where she started her an incredible non-profit), she will always be part of the Soul fam!  , Our favorite Soul sucess stories are when riders go from being completely resistant to completely obsessed. And SC Original LAURIE SCOLLAR definitely fits the bill. A beautiful rider inside and out - we can't wait to ride with you five blocks north!, JULIE DERMER is the latest SC Original to make the leap from rider to instructor! There must be something in the 72nd St air because that rear lobby has churned out some pretty fabulous teachers. Can't wait to see Julie join the ranks up on the W 77th instructor bike! , It's amazing how many of our original riders ended up having a profound effect on the company. You know may STEPHANIE HIRSCH as the genius designer behind our the SoulCycle line... or you may simply know her as the fun-loving rider who's rocking it out on the next bike.  , Happy Birthday, Jamie Kefer!, LAURIE COLE was voted one of US Weekly's Most Stylish New Yorkers!! , ELLEN GRAYSON has got to be one of the biggest characters to walk into the Rear Lobby. She has been known to stand on the sign-in desk, to show off one of her hundred pairs of sneakers, and to call multiple times a day to find out who she's sitting next to. But she also has one of the biggest hearts. From helping create Teen Spin, to decorating instructor podiums, to creating"blinged out" shirts for the front desk. What would SC West be without Ellen Grayson? We hope we never have to find out! , Amazing FITNESS Magazine ride with Jenny Gaither at the helm and cover girls BL 11 Olivia Ward and BL 11 Hannah Curlee in the pack!, SC Original VANI KOVITCH discovered SOUL at the beach, but quickly became a W 72nd transplant. Ever since that summer, we have been grateful for Vani's early arrivals, her easy going temperament, and her wicked sense of humor!  Looking forward to continuing the ride at W77th! , For SC Original, KRISTIN KREBS-DICK, what started as a way to lose baby weight soon became a lifestyle. This is one of the best descriptions of the Soul experience we’ve read in a while. Thank you, Kristin! , You can tell by her description of W 72nd, that SC Original TRACY LIMPE is intimately familiar with the studio. In fact, she is such a West Side loyalist that even though Tracy moved to Greenwich Connecticut, she mixes up her Scarsdale workouts with treks to the rear lobby. Thank you, Tracy! Can’t wait to ride with you on 77th!  , To know LISANNE GODNICK is to love her. Her bright red hair, her boisterous personality, and her loud singing (belting, really) on the bike can't help but put a smile on your face. Lisanne has been with Soul since day ONE and it certainly would not be the same without her. , A true Soul original and a fixture at the W 72nd studio, HARRIET CROMAN helped build the Soul Community from the very beginning. Harriet says that riding on the West Side feels like home and, we have to say, she makes it feel like home for us too. Thank you, Harriet! , For Sign-Ups today... Here's a list of our "Wreck the Studio" Team Teachers!

Thank you, Jamie! , LAURIE COLE in Bermuda with Jennifer Gardner Trulson's memoir "Where You Left Me.", Soul Original MARISSA KAY heard about SC at a Justin Timberlake concert and, even though she now lives in Hoboken, she makes sure to fit in her ride.
