James Harden, however, is one of the few great ones. This past season, in just his fifth NBA campaign, the native of Los Angeles, CA, averaged 27.4 points per game, 7 apg and 5.4 rpg. Those numbers were good enough to vault Harden into the MVP race, where he ultimately finished second. The 26-year-old is much more than the sum of that math, though. It's arguable, in fact, that between his flowing beard and Cali swag, Harden just as much skill off of the court. When you combine all of that—the hoops and the style—you get the perfect #punksandpoets. Welcome to the team, James., Stance is proud to introduce a line of underwear for the unabashed and the bold.

Oblanna is a mash-up of Mark Oblow’s photography and mixed medium art fused into his first sock with Stance. Moblow's ability to not only shoot stunning photos, but to manipulate them into art using razors and spray paint is what makes collaborating with him a no-brainer. Capturing the creativity of Oblow and the uninhibited beauty of Lanna, a muse of Stance, has been achieved and constructed into the swanky socks he designed. Check out the Threads video below to get an in depth look at what went into the socks and stop by Oblow’s Punks and Poets page to get to know him a bit better.
