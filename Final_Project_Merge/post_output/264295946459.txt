The message below is from one of our Mass soldiers requesting assistance.
 
‚ÄúWe are a National Guard unit from the great state of Massachusetts. Our soldiers come from every state in New England. Our unit is located at different locations throughout Afghanistan. We are a construction company that is spread out to many austere environments. Soldiers are unable to purchase toiletries such as razors, shaving cream, soap, baby wipes, toothpaste, wash cloths etc. Unit enjoys items that remind them of home i.e. Dunkin Donuts coffee, cranberry, Patriots, Boston, Cape Cod and any other regional delights. Conditions are less than ideal and Soldiers go through socks and underwear. We love sports and games to help us pass the time where we have no electricity. We would also truly appreciate a nice letter or card to reaffirm to us that we are appreciated back home.‚Äù

If you weren't able to be there come to Tico and try these pairings!, Join Michael Schlow Thursday November 8th at The Independent Room for a one night only pop up at 1363 Boylston st Boston ma 02215 
In a bipartisan effort Chef Schlow has created two menus both politically charged, both satirical, sparing neither candidate.
Whoever wins the Presidential Election, Michael will prepare that menu on the 8th...
Michael promises that:
if Obama wins the menu will feature "out of control spending with plenty of pork" for $75...but no worries he will offer a bail out with a $25 gift card for your next visit.
If Romney wins we will cut the cost of the menu ($60) although Michael has no idea how he will pay for it yet...he'a pretty sure that 47 percent of the people won't care anyway.
This isn't really about politics and who won and who lost.....we don't even care if you're a Sarah Palin fan..this is just an excuse to throw a dinner party not a political party., Patron Dinner at Happy's Bar and Kitchen
