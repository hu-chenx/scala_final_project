What are your big plans today?, My Take:  I've said from day one I never liked the case against Tom Brady. There was no evidence he was involved. This should have been taken up with the team as an equipment issue. This was about Roger Goodell trying to flex muscle after botching the Ray Rice case. 

The judge ruled how the NFL should have ruled. Goodell and his leadership looks bad but he's safe because he brings in too many dollars for his 32 bosses, the owners. Brady wins today but his reputation is forever stained. Some fans will always call him a cheater and yet there is still no evidence. The judge made the right decision. 

I would not bet against the Patriots in any game this year. Brady has extra motivation. Your take?, You can brag about your child athlete too.
