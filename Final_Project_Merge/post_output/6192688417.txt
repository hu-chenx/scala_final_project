About the Soap Box Derby

AKRON, Ohio (May 09, 2012) – More than 60 student teams representing schools in Ohio, North Carolina and Maryland will compete in the third annual International Soap Box Derby Gravity Racing Challenge (GRC) event here at Derby Downs on Saturday, May 19. 

The GRC competition is for student teams studying the construction and racing principles of gravity-powered Soap Box Derby race cars as part of their schools’ Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) curriculum. The first GRC event in 2010 had two teams and in 2011, there were nine teams from Akron area schools.

“The STEM program is a natural extension of traditional Soap Box Derby racing into elementary and middle schools,” explained Joe Mazur, president and chief executive of the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby.  “Teachers can engage students in the engineering of the racer’s design process and the important technical aspects such as weight distribution and wind resistance.” 

Mazur said the majority of schools in the GRC race on May 19 are from northeastern Ohio, including Akron, Cuyahoga Falls, Tallmadge, Rootstown, North Canton, Louisville, and Westlake.

Highly qualified technology and engineering (T & E) teachers use the problem-solving skills associated with Soap Box Derby racers as the “design and build” component of the learning cycle.

“Our students are learning about geometry, simple machines, energy, speed, and data analysis through the GRC project.  Once we catch their attention with this type of experience, we can increase their interest in learning about engineering and design, and hopefully their future in a STEM field,” said Rootstown Middle School T & E teacher Ed Bose.  

Justin Christopher of Tallmadge Middle School added “It is equally important that the larger body of students in the U.S. be technologically literate so that all students have opportunities to develop the design and problem-solving skills that enable them to be successful in modern society and participate as informed global citizens.  The GRC event is an outstanding and thrilling way for our students to accomplish that as a main goal in their education.”

The Akron AAA is the sponsor of awards, while Flemings Steakhouse in Akron, Waterloo Transmissions and Romeo’s Pizza have purchased car kits as team sponsors.  Google, in collaboration with Appalachia State University, is sponsor of the GRC competition near its facility in Lenoir, N.C.  Google purchased more than 20 car kits for Lenoir area school teams and is sponsoring the winning team from Hudson Middle School in the competition in Akron. Wing Warehouse in Akron is the sponsor of the teacher appreciation workshop.

More than 300 students ages 7 through 17 are expected to compete in the GRC event on May 19, when events begin at 9:00 a.m. with a track parade and opening ceremonies at Derby Downs. The event is free to the public and all are welcome to attend. The kids will be having practice runs on both Thursday and Friday, May 17 and 18, and these events are open to the public as well with free admission.

FirstEnergy Corporation of Akron became the program’s title sponsor earlier this year. More than 500 youngsters will compete in the 75th FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby at Derby Downs on Saturday, July 21., SOAP BOX DERBY INTRODUCES 75TH ANNIVERSARY LOGO; ORGANIZATION SEEKS MEMORIES FROM RACERS, SPECTATORS

Akron, OH - As the 75th running of the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby approaches in July, the organization is introducing a commemorative logo to honor the program's heritage.

The special logo, which will be used in promotional materials and on apparel, features an early-years race car, the name of the youth racing program, a large "75" and the name of new title sponsor FirstEnergy Corporation.

"The commemorative logo will be used during the 2012 racing season as a tribute to the proud 75-year history of the Soap Box Derby program," said Joe Mazur, president and chief executive officer of the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby.

The 75th running of the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby will feature boys and girls ages 7 to 17 in their gravity-powered race cars at Akron's Derby Downs on Saturday, July 21.  Winners in each of the six racing divisions will receive a $5,000 Goodyear Champion's Scholarship from Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.

"The Soap Box Derby has touched hundreds of thousands of lives over its many years-racers and their families, as well as volunteers, sponsors and fans who support the program in communities around the globe and at the championship finals here in Akron," Mazur said.

The organization is asking Derby fans to share their favorite All-American Soap Box Derby memories from the viewpoint as a participant or as a spectator watching the festivities.  Edited versions of these memories will be posted on the Soap Box Derby website and printed in other Race Week publications.

Fans may send their memories to Soap Box Derby Memories, P.O. Box 7225, Akron, Ohio 44306 or to Derbymemories@aol.com

The All-American Soap Box Derby started in 1934 in Dayton, Ohio.  Akron's central location and hilly terrain triggered a relocation of the event in 1935.  The following year, Akron's community leadership and the federal Works Progress Administration made Derby Downs the permanent site for the youth racing event.  With the exception of four years missed during World War II, racers from around the globe have annually competed in local and regional qualifying events for the opportunity to come to Akron to challenge Derby Downs in the championship finals.

More than 500 finalists from 230 races, including competitions in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Germany and around the United States, are expected to compete in the 75th championship finals here on July 21., If you missed the Desperate Housewives episode yesterday you can still watch it on the web.

Thanks Derby families, you are the best!

Students from Jacobs Fork Middle School won first place in creativity in the first Western North Carolina Gravity Games.
Twenty-three middle schools in the region participated in the engineering competition sponsored by Google and Appalachian State University.
The students used wrenches, lock washers and a soldering iron to build the American Soap Box Derby Superstock car from a kit. The youngsters collaborated on the design of the car, which included the team catch phrase "This is How We Roll." The logo also was on team T-shirts.
The Jacobs Fork team practiced driving the car in the school parking lot. Fred Kelly advised the team, with soap box derby expertise provided by Barron Atkinson. Rutter's Rod Shop in Hickory donated the labor and materials to paint the car, and Jacobs Fork took home the best looking trophy thanks to the professional paint job by Rutter's and Eddie Howard.
