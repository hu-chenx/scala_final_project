The restaurant is fine but the electric company, Eversource, has cut down all the power and gas and is being very slow to take any action to fix it. August first was when they told us, other 2 businesses and 6 Tennants to leave the building untill they can fix the problem but we have been calling them everday to find out when they will start working but it seems like they do not care that it has been SIXTEEN days and we have NO answer from them but please don't loose hope, as soon as we have some answer from them, we will inform you all and we will be back to providing you all delicious food and excellent service.)
