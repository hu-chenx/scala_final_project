These are the guys professional sports franchises look to build their teams around. No matter what the situation, these 4 would do whatever it takes to make sure they were putting on the Akron uniform next to their teammates game after game. They've seen it all. Games in -15 degree weather. Games in 95 degree weather. Games where there seemed like no hope. Games where there were no worries. Former division opponents turned NCAA Programs. Conference Tournaments. National Tournaments. Winning records and losing records...but most importantly...the best record in school history (11-4). Their journey has shaped the face of this program to what it is today and what it strives to become...which is the #1 place to play lacrosse in Ohio alongside your education...and all 4 will leave here with their degrees in just a few short weeks. Thank you guys for everything you've done, the memories, friendship, brotherhood and effort you gave every second you stepped onto the field. Congratulations and welcome...Class of 2015.

Officially done with my freshmen year of college!, 2014 Senior of the Year: #23 Bill Drockton

Drockton, the 4 year starter, finished his career with the Zips as the teams point leader for the 2014 season. Appearing in every game except 3 this season...Drockton averaged 3 goals per game, reaching 7 goals in a single game against the University of Findlay. After making the adjustment from Midfield to Attack last season...Drockton moved back to his high school days where he led West Geauga his senior year with 56 goals. He will leave behind a large void to fill on the field and in the stat book. #GoZips, 2014 Junior of the Year: #30 Ben Edwards

In his third year with the Zips, Edwards, a 3 year starter, started in every game of the 2014 season. Since appearing in his first game against John Carroll University in 2011/12 season, he has continued to create the Zips defense into an impenetrable wall. His freshman year was the only year the Zips have not appeared in the National Tournament, but since then, he has lead the team to 2 back-back appearances and a first ever Sweet 16 appearance this season with a 10-5 win over Eastern Kentucky University. Entering his senior season, he will once again look to re-create the defensive standpoint that has been exemplary for the last 2 season., 2014 Sophomore of the Year: #16 Richard Kenney

After losing Midfielder Jensen Mrozinski to graduation last season, the Zips had gaps to fill in that area and Kenney did not shy away. Joining Trevor Hanes and Nick Lopez in the front lines of the Zips midfield...Richard was a starter from the first pre-season game in the Fall. He started every game of the 2014 season, and finished in the Top 10 for point leaders on the roster. With his first year with the Zips under his belt, and another large graduating midfield class...Kenney will look to become the leader of the midfield for the Zips in the 2014/15 season. #GoZips, 2014 Freshman of the Year: #28 Victor Santana 

Santana started every game of the 2013 pre-season and the 2014 regular season before having his season cut short by a leg injury. Victor took a lead roll in the Zips defense this year, stepping up to some of the strongest teams in the Midwest. He is a leader on and off the field and will continue to heal/rehab into the 2014/15 season. #GoZips, Congratulations to Binghamton University on winning the 2014 NCLL Division II National Championship., Retweeted Akron Club Baseball (@AkronBaseball):

Midwest Conference

"By capturing the regular season Midwest North and South top seeds respectively, both #8 Bowling Green and #24 Eastern Kentucky will host a Conference Championship (see DSC below). With the rest of the field in doubt, many factors will come into play as the North has #23 Saginaw Valley, Akron and UM-Flint with impressive resumes while the South had statement seasons from #17 Xavier, Ball State and #21 Bellarmine. Not all teams listed above will make the final cut, but from the progression from one season to the next, teams have completed fantastic strides from their inaugural season."

‚Äú@AkronLacrosse: 4 schools Midwest Conf r currently on 3+ win streaks Akron, @bgsulacrosse @bgsulacrosse & @SVSULacrosse"#strengthinnumbers, Retweeted UAkron Rec (@UAsrws):

Welcome back, students!  Get moving today, one way or another., 3 schools from the Midwest Conference are currently on 3+ game winning streaks. Akron, Bowling Green, Eastern Kentucky and Saginaw Valley., Blog: Why this years Freshman class, is giving last years Freshman class a run for their money. The University of Akron Class of 2017 has become an intricate part of this years Zips Men's Lacrosse team, it's hard not to say the future looks bright for lacrosse in Akron. After last years historical season, this years class looks to not only match that, but continue and advance what has been in the making from the upperclassman for the last 2 years. From Face-off Specialists, all the way down to Defense, they cover the board and add a spark when needed to. Isaac Lumpkin, out of Worthington Kilbourne High School and Chandler Warren, from Dublin Coffman High School get it started right from the get go on the face. They are backed up by Matt Modderman from Stow High School; Tyler Booth and Jack Peel from Green High School at the Midfield. Full field control is seen by Bryce Williams and Jeremy Light out of Stow High School at LSM. Holding the fort down low is Victor Santanna from Brunswick High School, adding to Goalie Matt Gatto's regime of defense. What these players do off the field is as impressive as what they do on the field. 5 of the 7 of them are involved with Fraternity and Sorority Life and contribute to the Greek community and Akron community in many ways. With the tougher end of the 2014 schedule approaching, it will be a true test of their talent to see who steps up to veteran play. #GoZips #ZipsGameday, Assists: (4) @knekolas (3) @SlipperyRich (2) @WildBill281 (2) @Gagnon14 (2) Tyler Booth (1) @ASweezy25 #ZipsGameday #GoZips, Goals edited: (7) @WildBill281 (1) @EJTrey4, Goals: (8) @WildBill281 (2) @knekolas (2) @Gagnon14 (2) Jack Peel (2) Tyler Booth (1) Sean Owens (1) @Phlap_Jack #ZipsGameday #GoZips, The Zips improve to 3-2 overall and 3-0 in the Midwest Conference and continue their undefeated home streak. #GoZips #ZipsGameday, Final here in Akron.

Marshall University, Saturday, March 1st 2014: NCLL Game of the Week Preview: Cincinnati Round Robin 

"No better way to open up league play than at historic Gettler Stadium as Midwest South Division I Cincinnati welcomes a rising Akron program set on taking the Bearcats spot in the top of Division II and in-state North rival Ohio State with results determining both future playoffs and Ohio pride. The Zips have high expectations after finishing 2013 on a tear with a 7-1 record (11-5 overall) which negated the effects of two double OT losses earlier in the season. A key stat for Akron: 8-0 when offense scores in double digits, while 2-5 when scoring below. In a race to score 10 first, host Cincinnati owns a 22-0 record over the past two years and comes into Division I competition looking to elevate quickly  to its‚Äô rightful position. Sitting just two positions ahead, Ohio State held off a resilient and talented Bowling Green squad in OT but finds itself right back in the fire. With a 3-2 edge over the past three years held by UC, the Buckeyes will be sure to travel well and be ready to avenge last season‚Äôs slide. Judging by past experiences, Ohio State has welcomed in state competition as long as it doesn't disturb the throne."

@rachel_james4 @karariccardi @AkronLacrosse count me in on this!!, #ZipsGameday Men's Lacrosse at Bowling Green State University! Face-off at 2pm #GoZips, The Zips open up their fall pre-season against inner conference rival Bowling Green State University. This weekend marks the 2nd year in a row that Bowling Green will host The University of Akron during their Alumni Weekend. Since 2011, the Zips have exchanged wins and loses with the Falcons, garnering more 1-2 goal differential and overtimes that any other university played. This weekend looks to be no different as both schools look to advance once again out of the Midwest North Conference as the #1 and #2 teams. On the Zips end, look for a majority of playing time to come from freshman and transfer players as they adjust to the new system. Sophomore Sean Owens and Senior Josh Nagy aim to control the face-off while Sophomore Rich Kenney and Freshman Matt Modderman handle the pace at midfield. On the defensive end, Sophomore Billy Samilson will be the voice on the defense in goal with Freshman Bryce Williams, Victor Santana and Sophomore Camden Kloss supporting him at Dpole. Stay updated with us to find out more information as we approach the season and lookout for us at 2pm tomorrow. Go Zips!, Are you playing lacrosse this weekend? Send us your pictures playing some Midwest Lacrosse while we travel to BGSU! http://t.co/VC9TC0BGz6, Game details for this Saturdays pre-season game against Bowling Green have gone out via text and email.

(For game info see notes), Progression comes with sacrifice and because of the new acquisitions the dues for the program were raised and some players did not return.  Despite the loss of players the Zips finished the 2010 season 11-5 going on a 9 game winning streak to end the season and letting the lacrosse nation know that they are on the rise., UA finished 5-3 in the 2009 season with their last game coming as a win over top division competitor Youngstown State University.
 
In 2010 the program took a giant leap forward and moved to make the team a recognized and respected program by acquiring team helmets (Cascade Pro7's) and team uniforms produced by Nike., Prior to 2009 Akron's Club team was nothing more than a beer league of guys who just wanted to come out and play.  Within Frato's term the club has prospered into one of Ohio's strongest programs in the NCLL.  In 2009 the first step was taken into acquiring pennies which were to distinguish and serve as uniforms for games., The University of Akron Men's Lacrosse team founded in 2009 by Christopher Frato (to the left) is part of The University of Akron's Club Sports Department and also a member of the NCLL (National Club Lacrosse League).  Christopher was a member and goalie for UA's Ice Hockey team in which his brother had founded and took it upon himself to ignite one of the most popular sports in Northeast Ohio on Akron's Campus.)
