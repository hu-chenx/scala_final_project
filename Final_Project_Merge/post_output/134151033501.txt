TOM YUM PAD THAI is originating from NOODLE STREET.  In August 2006, our Chef Nooch wanted to create a new dish exclusively for NOODLE STREET. The idea came from just one simple conversation in the kitchen "Since everyday we always have lots orders of Pad thai, Tom Yum, Pad Thai, Tom Yum so on and on. Why don't we just put it together?"  Here's we go! The Chef try adding the main ingredients from the famous Tom yum soup into Pad thai to create distinct hot and fragrant herb flavors which will not disturb the original flavor of the Pad Thai. Chef Nooch uses fresh herb ingredients instead of commercial Tom Yum paste which has different characteristics.  Since then Tom Yum Pad Thai became one of our best selling dishes., Hi, NOODLE Fans!
