Our $1 oysters nights (Sunday-Tuesday) at the bar leave us with hundreds of leftover shells and it makes sense to not waste material that can be used again to help the environment and improve health of wild oyster beds.
A few weeks ago a Japanese news crew came and did a piece on  our shell recycling program.  The video's in Japanese but it's still really entertaining!, Eat, drink, get a free ride, AND support a good cause.  http://t.co/UnRRZ0ZuKs #betterdining via @reserve, We're happy to participate in this event with our friends from Reserve.
