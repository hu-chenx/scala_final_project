Hi LaLa Rohk This is Jorge Dones, 

I'm heading to the beach a little early this year! I know the water will probably be below 40 degrees on February 23rd, but let's be honest, it won't be much warmer come August 23rd - we are in New England after all! 

Why would I do something so wacky? The Polar Plunge helps support 12,592 individuals with intellectual disabilities that have chosen to live a healthier and happier life by participating in programs offered by Special Olympics Massachusetts. 

All Plungers and Chickens are asked to raise a minimum of $250 - will you support me? For every $100 I raise one athlete will be able to take part in Special Olympics Massachusetts' traditional sports prgramming as well as a Special Smiles screening. As part of the Healthy Athletes program, Special Smiles offers dental screenings, health education and prevention services, and refers athletes to potential sources of treatment and follow-up care.

If I raise the minimum of $250 I will pay for a group of 10 athletes to participate in a Healthy Huddle session. Athletes who attend a Healthy Huddle session will receive health education and awareness about sports-specific topics. They will get to see a speaker and take part in an interactive portion of the event. Each Athlete will take home health education tools and materials and, hopefully, become a better athlete on and off the playing field! 

You can help me reach this goal by making a donation online. Click on the link below and you will be taken to my personal donation page where you can make a secure online credit card donation. And then feel free to meet me when I come out of the water with a cup of coffee and 7 towels!

You can do more! Help us reach more people by following us on Facebook and Twitter!
