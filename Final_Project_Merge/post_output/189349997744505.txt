List(null, Dear customers, Cha Yen Thai Cookery will be, from July 6th - August 10th, closed every MONDAY. Thank you and looking forward to seeing you! :), To my dear customers, I was quite taken aback by the news that Cha Yen Thai Cookery has won the Improper Bostonian award for "Best Thai Restaurant of 2015". We have been opened for barely a year and we have barely enough seats in the restaurant. We could not have done it without your continued support and we want to tell you THANK YOU! We will try our best to expand the business so that we have more places to sit and dine in! #Bostonsbest

It is because of you that my tiny little restaurant which is all I can afford to open right now, is thriving and doing well. It has been my dream since I was a very young to open my own restaurant and you guys have helped me realize my dream and that is all I think a person could ask for in life. Looking forward to serving you every single day of the week!
