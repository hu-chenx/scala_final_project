Before I do, just wanna say was an honour it was to play that song with Nick, he is a legend and a gentleman. Anyway. Here's the email....

Hi Ed

Really great experience, many thanks for a great performance. And a great day out ! 

Following a bit of post show stuff with some of the PF fans getting outraged at people not realising the song was not your new release, I just wanted to go on record to suggest they chill on this.

As far as I'm concerned what you did was a really great version of the song, and its one of the nicest tributes to have any artist choose to play another's work,  particularly an artist whose a great song writer in his own right. Personally I really enjoy re-interpretations of other peoples work, be it Joe Cocker (Little Help...) Jimmy Hendrix (All along the Watchtowers...) or Dub side of the Moon, Eric Pridz or the Scissor Sisters....

Sooner or later people will work out the origin of the song, and who knows, maybe check out our catalogue,  just as hopefully our fans might check out yours. Music doesn't have to be entirely partisan – Or if it does, no one bothered to tell me...

Love, 

Y.P.S.C.      

Nick

i have always said i will do what i want musically, whether it be making songs with underground rappers, or writing songs for pop acts, or doing my own solo thing, i love making music, if you are a fan of me you will understand that

i am always gonna continue making good music for myself, collaborating with my favourite artists, and as far as songwriting is concerned, i will write for who i want, i just enjoy writing songs,

hope this has cleared things up for anyone who was confused,

im back to running this page, no one else

22nd June - St Agnes, The Tap House - http://www.the-taphouse.com/

Next week I am announcing some NORWICH dates, very excited.

, for all those asking, latitude did not book me this year, i wanted to play, just didnt get booked...., In the studio with Shy FX making a reggae dub of The A Team, thank you all so much on the feedback for the new tune :) glad you like it!!, NEW(ish) Song LET IT OUT for 79p on itunes!

http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/loose-change-bonus-track/id424904644, Hey guys! as I said yesterday, i uploaded a re packaged EP to itunes with a new(ish) song!

Heres the link.......... 

http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/loose-change-bonus-track/id424904644, so yeah, thank you all so much for supporting the song, coz its meant we can do this!

il do a post when the new song is up on itunes, should be within the next few hours

big love everyone, speak soooooon xx, The good news (theres lots of it) is that I will be putting up the origional version of loose change (with a song that was meant to be on but was taken off coz i was meant to be releasing it last year but never did) today.

which means ya'll get a new(ish) song if you want it on itunes in the new version of loose change,

and i get to have The A Team on national radio and TV, which would be amazing., firstly, the bad news is i am taking down loose change from iTunes so radio can be given a release date for the song, but i will be bundling some very cool remix's of the song for its real release, the physical CD of Loose Change will still be available from my website,, So! Lots of news...

The A Team is now gonna be nationally released as my first single coz of you guys, its had alot of support form radio and tv, but we are taking it one step further and really pushing it out there, so hopefully it will get out to even more people, which is fantastic news!

There is some good news and some bad news with this... both are really good news at the end of the day....., Found this video when i was clearing out the old laptop today. This is from my first headline show, Norwich Waterfront, August 5th! loooove it, I'm in with Shy FX later this week doing some musical madness, Hey guys, one of my very good friends Random Impulse (he features on the collaborations project) brought out his new EP OVERLOAD today...its no.20 in the Hip Hop Charts at the mo, lets give an extra push! its only £2.49! > http://ow.ly/48R38
