We will be offering a large variety of our award winning wines and sangria to share in celebration of our harvest of fresh grapes, as we begin the wine-making season.  We will be conducting a grape crushing and wine making demonstration so you can see first-hand how the wine making process begins. Please join us in the celebration!
