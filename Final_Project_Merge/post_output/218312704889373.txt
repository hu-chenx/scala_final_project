Happy Birthday!, Just tapped - Firestone Walker 15

This is Firestone Walker's 15th Anniversary Ale and it will not be available again. If you enjoy truly great beer, this is one you shouldn't miss.

From Firestone Walker:
 As a finished beer, XV is alive with amazing complexity and yet it is quite possibly the most integrated and seamless blend yet. 

Looking at a blend of 8 beers on paper at first looks chaotic and potentially disjointed; however, a closer look reveals and interesting theme: 76% Barley Wine style beers, 19% Stout and 5% Imperial IPA.  XV introduces our new blonde barley wine Helldorado with flavors of lavender honey liqueur. The well established DDBA delivers its signature American toasted oak, English caramel toffee and light leather nuances.  2010 vintage Sticky Monkey folds in brown sugar, maple, cinnamon, ginger and ripe figs.  Parabola brings the familiar flavors of roasted dark coco, and chocolate covered cherries. Velvet Merkin carries silky milk chocolate, toasted coconut and creamy textures. Good Foot and Bravo add assertive barley wine warmth and lush barrel derived vanilla bean notes.  The game changer this year is the addition of Double Jack to the blend.  At just 5% its massive dry hop character brings citrus zest, tangerine and mango aromas making this a completely new beer. It was an absolute pleasure in the making and I truly hope you enjoy our Sixth oak-aged blend!, Tonight, a Roasted Corn & Shitake Mushroom Risotto with a Lobster Tail and Wilted Spinach - very delicious!, Our draught beer selection this week includes:

Aging of beer is not considered economically feasible. However, in order to be designated a Marzen-Oktoberfestbier, not only must the beer be brewed within the city limits of Munich, but it normally will have stayed in the lagering tanks for 12-16 weeks. This extended aging produces a beer that is full-bodied with a malt-accented finish. Prost!, Marzen-Oktoberfestbier is the official beer of Oktoberfest. What is Marzen? In the days before refrigeration, the last beer brewed before the summer heat was made in March (Marzen). It was then stored in casks in cold caves for consumption during the hot weather.
