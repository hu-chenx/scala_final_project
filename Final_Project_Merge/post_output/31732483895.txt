Will be updated. With AP Photos. LORAIN, Ohio (AP) - A wildlife researcher for the state of Ohio says the state's bald eagle population appears to be thriving after an increase in nests and hatchlings last year. The (Lorain) Morning Journal reports (http://bit.ly/1FMwRxn ) that wildlife crews with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources calculated that there were 200 bald eagle nests in Ohio in 2014 compared with an estimated 189 the year before, and that the number of eaglets hatched jumped from 189 in 2013 to 347 last year. The researcher told the newspaper there are at least five nests in Lorain County, west of Cleveland, and five or six in Lake County, east of Cleveland. She said there could be more. The researcher says food availability is probably why the number of eaglets hatched varies from year to year. ___ Information from: The Morning Journal, http://www.morningjournal.com http://on.wkyc.com/1Ho1I22, Ch 3 Weather...
