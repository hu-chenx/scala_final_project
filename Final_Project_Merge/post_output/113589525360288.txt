Some historians believe that in older times young children would carve pumpkins into makeshift lanterns to spook local townies and travelers alike after noting that guards (who patrolled with regular lanterns in the dead of night) would often be mistaken for spirits. Want a throwback to that old Halloween feel? Blackstone's Beacon Hill has graciously donated some lanterns to us that we will be auctioning off. All proceeds go to our Cheers For Children event!
