#cheftony, It is with heart felt sorrow that I share the news of Prima e Dopo's  closing. Unfortunately, "partnership" is not a friend of Tony and I, and I guess the saying is true "partners are made for dancing" We tried our best to make it work, and it did work! Unfortunately not in our partners eyes. See, a partnership is 50/50. If the business is going good, then everyone is happy.... but if the business has a down fall, then it's up to the partners to pick up the slack and dance again! Therefore, its a 2 way street good or bad. We have done our part to make it as best as it could have been, and it's been great! With that being said, when things went bad, we needed the other half to come forward and work together as a team, I'm sorry to say my partner didn't and wouldn't. I tried everything in my power to possibly buy him out, but the numbers he was talking were ridiculous, and I was not falling in his trap. He even went as far as saying that "any dollar amount that he wanted was priceless to us ( Tony & I),  and our (Rino's Place) reputation was on the line". Therefore, you can see for yourself what kind of person we were dealing with! And as a result Prima will be closing as of June 1st! 

I want to express how thankful Tony and I are for all of the support we have received over the last 3 years. Our customers were happy both old, and new...and that was the whole idea.... If they were happy, we were happy! To our family, and friends who were there for us right from the beginning, we thank you! 

All of us at Prima became a family, and I want to thank all of staff for standing by us when it was good, and when it was bad. Our Staff has made Prima what it is today. It's something I will never forget!  From Joe the head bartender, who made the best drinks from cordials, to having the best beer selection around bottled and tapped. Richard our chef, put out some of the best tasting food around! From all our servers, and those in between.... I sincerely thank you all  from the bottom of my heart. All though Prima is no more, you will always be considered family to Tony & I

Last but not least, I know it was very convenient for our waiting customer to have Prima right there.... Just steps away! We have been in business for nearly 30 years, and we never had a waiting are or Prima to go to! I know in the summer people don't mind hanging outside in good'ole East Boston, waiting for their table. The winter is different... It's cold, and snowy! We would like you all to go visit out friends at Kelly's square pub on Bennington street. It's in walking distance! Tell them Rinos sent you......

I will leave you with the following and I want to reassure you Rino's Place isn't going any where. We are here to stay. We are who we are today because of you, our customers, and for that we thank you!

Tony & Anna Dicenso, Dining room opens at 4 today! Come on down, for the Best  Italian Food in Town....., In BRADY we trust....GO PATS!!, Rino's Place is proud to announce the newest member of our family Miss Hadley! Ashley gave birth in the middle of the blizzard! Show them some love....‚ù§Ô∏è, Due to this mound of snow in front of our door, Rino's Place will be closed today Wednesday, January 28th. I reassure you, Chef Tony & crew is working hard to be sure  to open tomorrow with regular business hours!

We apologize for any inconvenience  this may cause you!, Rino's Place will be closed from Monday 1/19 thru Saturday 1/24 for our much needed winter vacation. We will reopen on Monday 1/26 with regular business hours!

Thank you in advance!, Merry Christmas to all of you, from all of us....

From our family to yours..., Freedom isn't FREE!

Thank you to all the past, present & future!, Chef Tony had the privilege of cooking for the Menino family yesterday. I had the honor of delivering the food. I was also given the opportunity of paying my respects to Mayor Menino, and meeting Angela & the Menino family. I was privileged to be behind the scenes of such a rememberable moment, that I will never forget. The family was very thankful for all that we have done. I, in return said to Angela  "it does not equal to what you & Mayor Menino has done for the city of Boston". She gave me a hug, and I went on my way.

As I stated to the Menino family....
Tony & I, and our entire staff send our deepest of condolences to all of you. 

Forever in hearts! ‚ù§Ô∏è, In honor of the late Mayor Tom Menino. Governor Deval Patrick, city & state councilmen & great friends joined together for lunch today. #mayortommenino  
#bostonstrong
#rinosplace, Today the voice of Boston has passed on. Mayor Tom Menino was not just a Mayor, he was a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a friend. We had the honor of knowing him personally & his wife Angela. You may have been lucky enough to have been dining with us on the many occasions as Tom & Angela did. He had class, a true gem, who did Boston right. He has touched many of us Bostonians, in many ways. He was there when it was good, and when it was bad. No matter what, Mayor Menino was just there....always

Our deepest condolences to the Menino family. May he fly high, free of pain, and may he forever hold eternal peace.

Rest in Peace Mayor Tom  Menino... Fly free our friend, fly free.......

Tony & Anna Dicenso
and our staff from
Rino's Place, The city of East Boston has lost a true gem today, one of a kind, the "great one",  and most importantly the voice for us "city" kids.
