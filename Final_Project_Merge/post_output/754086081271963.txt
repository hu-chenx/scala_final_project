Quotable: Avi Shemtov opened Canton’s The Chubby Chickpea in 2010, serving Mediterranean food. In 2012, he took to the Boston streets. “This is the cool thing: We have a restaurant in the ’burbs and a truck in the city.” Shemtov says. “We see people that would never be at our restaurant. We get a young, urban crowd.”
