He goes through the Heat's locker room area, back over to the training room, and who is already just sitting there in the tub‚Ä¶Kobe Bryant. Wade told me in the 13 years he‚Äôs played for the Heat, he‚Äôs never ever seen Pat Riley let an opposing player into the inner sanctum like that, using the team‚Äôs facilities, and that frankly, he was shocked. Of course, that's the respect that Kobe has earned, and the two old friends had a great, long talk. At the end of it, Kobe asked Dwyane if his sons were coming to the game the next night. Dwyane said no, as it was a school night, and Kobe said, 'you know what, bring them, I think it‚Äôs going to be my last time here.' Dwyane brought the boys, they got a lifetime memory after the game taking pictures with Kobe, and the Wade family got a little sneak-preview of Kobe's retirement announcement before anyone else., Daily Double: interviewed Dwyane Wade and Kevin Durant this morning.

####

I am bringing this lawsuit against FanDuel for using my name, image, and likeness in both daily fantasy contests and through advertising on TV ads and infomercials. FanDuel has taken the liberty to engaged in these actions without my consent and without proper licensing rights. As a result of these activities, FanDuel daily fantasy contests have shown increasing revenues leading to large profits. Therefore, on behalf of myself as well as any other players who are being treated unjustly, I chose to file a complaint.

I have been advised by my attorneys not to speak any further on the topic while the case is pending. Any other questions regarding this matter can be addressed to my agent, Brad Cicala., Reggie Miller naming the celebs at Madison Square Garden during our NBA on TNT broadcast of the New York Knicks vs the Atlanta Hawks: Jimmy Fallon, Ben Stiller, Kate Upton, Justin Verlander ...and "that little hobbit Spike Lee" üòÇüòÇüòÇ NBA, Remember when Chuck said the Golden State Warriors were just a jump-shooting team that couldn't win an NBA title?

Text below:

####

I am very disappointed by the NFL‚Äôs decision to uphold the 4 game suspension against me. I did nothing wrong, and no one in the Patriots organization did either.
Despite submitting to hours of testimony over the past 6 months, it is disappointing that the Commissioner upheld my suspension based upon a standard that it was ‚Äúprobable‚Äù that I was ‚Äúgenerally aware‚Äù of misconduct. The fact is that neither I, nor any equipment person, did anything of which we have been accused. He dismissed my hours of testimony and it is disappointing that he found it unreliable.
I also disagree with yesterdays narrative surrounding my cellphone. I replaced my broken Samsung  phone with a new iPhone 6 AFTER my attorneys made it clear to the NFL that my actual phone device would not be subjected to investigation under ANY circumstances. As a member of a union, I was under no obligation to set a new precedent going forward, nor was I made aware at any time during Mr. Wells investigation, that failing to subject my cell phone to investigation would result in ANY discipline.
Most importantly, I have never written, texted, emailed to anybody at anytime, anything related to football air pressure before this issue was raised at the AFC Championship game in January. To suggest that I destroyed a phone to avoid giving the NFL information it requested is completely wrong.
To try and reconcile the record and fully cooperate with the investigation after I was disciplined in May, we turned over detailed pages of cell phone records and all of the emails that Mr. Wells requested. We even contacted the phone company to see if there was any possible way we could retrieve any/all of the actual text messages from my old phone. In short, we exhausted every possibility to give the NFL everything we could and offered to go thru the identity for every text and phone call during the relevant time. Regardless, the NFL knows that Mr. Wells already had ALL relevant communications with Patriots personnel that either Mr. Wells saw or that I was questioned about in my appeal hearing. There is no ‚Äúsmoking gun‚Äù and this controversy is manufactured to distract from the fact they have zero evidence of wrongdoing.
I authorized the NFL Players Association to make a settlement offer to the NFL so that we could avoid going to court and put this inconsequential issue behind us as we move forward into this season. The discipline was upheld without any counter offer. I respect the Commissioners authority, but he also has to respect the CBA and my rights as a private citizen. I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players without a fight.
Lastly, I am overwhelmed and humbled by the support of family, friends and our fans who have supported me since the false accusations were made after the AFC Championship game. I look forward to the opportunity to resume playing with my teammates and winning more games for the New England Patriots., New Arizona Cardinals Coach Jen Welter, so smart on why today was so momentous. (Hint: it's not because of the latest turn in the #Delfategate saga.) "What I love is that this changes the dynamic of the dreams that little girls who love football can end up having from this day forward," Welter said. "They can literally say, 'I want to be a coach in the NFL one day.' I never could have seen that, because it had never happened before." #LikeAGirl, Whew - long (but interesting) night talking NFL, the New England Patriots, and Tom Brady on Anderson Cooper 360, CNN Tonight and the Charlie Rose Show.

NBA Cleveland Cavaliers New York Knicks, Here's the NFL statement on Roger Goodell handling the appeal of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady 4-game suspension (a suspension Goodell's own office issued.) Note the messaging to Brady & the NFL Players Association: 'don't complain; you agreed to this', Tom Thibodeau on whether he'll be the Chicago Bulls coach next year: "Until they tell me I'm not, I expect to be here. That's the way I'm approaching it.", Wow. Huge scoop from Bleacher Report - NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will personally hear the appeal that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady filed today on his 4-game suspension. That's Goodell's right under the CBA, but it highlights the issue many players have a problem with: he's the appeals officer on a ruling made by his own office. Brady's camp had asked for an "independent arbitrator" - they're not getting one., VIDEO: For your 2nd screen as you watch the Cleveland Cavaliers play the Chicago Bulls in Game 6, here's my NBA on TNT report with Pau Gasol (hamstring) explaining why he returned tonight., The Cleveland Cavaliers players park right next to our NBA on TNT truck.

Click on the Storify below for the summary:, Here's the photo the New England Patriots are now using as their avatar on their social media accounts. Gee, wonder if they are trying to tell the NFL something?, Here's Pau Gasol testing his strained hamstring before Chicago Bulls shootaround. He is questionable for Game 5 tonight vs the Cleveland Cavaliers. We tip on NBA on TNT at 7p ET.  #Playoffs NBA #FightToTheFinish, Here's what Don Yee, the agent for New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady had to say after Brady was suspended four games. Hint: he is not happy with the NFL.

#######

‚ÄúThe discipline is ridiculous and has no legitimate basis. In my opinion, this outcome was pre-determined; there was no fairness in the Wells investigation whatsoever. There is no evidence that Tom directed footballs be set at pressures below the allowable limits. In fact, the evidence shows Tom clearly emphasized that footballs be set at pressures within the rules. Tom also cooperated with the investigation and answered every question presented to him. The Wells Report presents significant evidence, however, that the NFL lacks standards or protocols with respect to its handling of footballs prior to games; this is not the fault of Tom or the Patriots. The report also presents significant evidence the NFL participated with the Colts in some type of pre-AFC Championship Game planning regarding the footballs. This fact may raise serious questions about the integrity of the games we view on Sundays. We will appeal, and if the hearing officer is completely independent and neutral, I am very confident the Wells Report will be exposed as an incredibly frail exercise in fact-finding and logic. The NFL has a well-documented history of making poor disciplinary decisions that often are overturned when truly independent and neutral judges or arbitrators preside, and a former federal judge has found the commissioner has abused his discretion in the past, so this outcome does not surprise me. Sadly, today‚Äôs decision diminishes the NFL as it tells its fans, players and coaches that the games on the field don‚Äôt count as much as the games played on Park Avenue.‚Äù, Cleveland Cavaliers Kyrie Irving had MRI on his left knee, confirmed diagnosis of tendinitis. Irving also has a sprained right foot. Cavs play the Chicago Bulls on NBA on TNT tomorrow night at 7p ET - should be a great one with the series tied 2-2., The Colorado Rockies posted this photo from the ballpark this morning. In related news, it's May.

######
 
Our office has been conducting an investigation as to whether the footballs used in last Sunday‚Äôs AFC Championship Game complied with the specifications that are set forth in the playing rules. The investigation began based on information that suggested that the game balls used by the New England Patriots were not properly inflated to levels required by the playing rules, specifically Playing Rule 2, Section 1, which requires that the ball be inflated to between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch. Prior to the game, the game officials inspect the footballs to be used by each team and confirm that this standard is satisfied, which was done before last Sunday‚Äôs game.
 
The investigation is being led jointly by NFL Executive Vice President Jeff Pash and Ted Wells of the law firm of Paul Weiss. Mr. Wells and his firm bring additional expertise and a valuable independent perspective. The investigation began promptly on Sunday night. Over the past several days, nearly 40 interviews have been conducted, including of Patriots personnel, game officials, and third parties with relevant information and expertise. We have obtained and are continuing to obtain additional information, including video and other electronic information and physical evidence. We have retained Renaissance Associates, an investigatory firm with sophisticated forensic expertise to assist in reviewing electronic and video information. 
 
The playing rules are intended to protect the fairness and integrity of our games. We take seriously claims that those rules have been violated and will fully investigate this matter without compromise or delay. The investigation is ongoing, will be thorough and objective, and is being pursued expeditiously. In the coming days, we expect to conduct numerous additional interviews, examine video and other forensic evidence, as well as relevant physical evidence. While the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were under-inflated were used by the Patriots in the first half, the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated. The goals of the investigation will be to determine the explanation for why footballs used in the game were not in compliance with the playing rules and specifically whether any noncompliance was the result of deliberate action. We have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence. 
 
Upon being advised of the investigation, the Patriots promptly pledged their full cooperation and have made their personnel and other information available to us upon request.  Our investigation will seek information from any and all relevant sources and we expect full cooperation from other clubs as well. As we develop more information and are in a position to reach conclusions, we will share them publicly., Seriously, the New York tabloids need to send the New England Patriots a thank-you note., Seriously, the New York tabloids need to buy the New England Patriots a thank-you present, This is...disturbing., Check out the NBA on TNT postgame show - I ask the New Orleans Pelicans Anthony Davis to show off his sketchbook skills by drawing the Chuckster.

Traveling back to Los Angeles today to receive further treatment and evaluation; no timetable for his recovery yet., Read it for yourself, #NFL fans: Here's the full transcript from New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick's news conference this morning.

BB: I'll start out by addressing the football issue here. When I came in Monday morning, I was shocked to learn of the news reports about the footballs. I had no knowledge whatsoever of this situation until Monday morning. I would say I've learned a lot more about this process in the last three days than I knew or have talked about it in the last 40 years that I have coached in this league. I had no knowledge of the various steps involved in the game balls and the process that happened between when they were prepared and went to the officials and went to the game. So, I've learned a lot about that. I obviously understand that each team has the opportunity to prepare the balls the way they want, give them to the officials and the game officials either approve or disapprove the balls. That really was the end of it for me until I learned a little bit more about this the last couple days. 

Let me just say that my personal coaching philosophy, my mentality has always been to make things as difficult as possible for players in practice. So with regard to footballs, I'm sure that any current or past player of mine would tell you that the balls we practice with are as bad as they can be: wet, sticky, cold, slippery. However bad we can make them, I make them. Any time that players complain about the quality of the footballs, I make them worse and that stops the complaining. We never use the condition of the footballs as an excuse. We play with whatever or kick with whatever we have to use and that's the way it is. That has never been a priority for me and I want the players to deal with a harder situation in practice than they'll ever have to deal with in the game. Maybe that's part of our ball security philosophy. 

I'm trying to coach the team and that's what I want to do. I think we all know that quarterbacks, kickers, specialists have certain preferences on footballs. They know a lot more about it than I do. They're a lot more sensitive to it than I am. I hear them comment on it from time to time, but I can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject. Zero. Tom's [Brady] personal preferences on his footballs are something he can take about in much better detail and information than I could possibly provide. I could tell you that in my entire coaching career I have never talked to any player, staff member about football air pressure. That is not a subject that I have ever brought up. To me the footballs are approved by the league and game officials pregame and we play with what's out there. That's the only way that I have ever thought about that. 

I've learned about the inflation range situation. Obviously with our footballs being inflated to the 12.5-pound range, any deflation would then take us under that specification limit. Knowing that now, in the future we will certainly inflate the footballs above that low level to account for any possible change during the game. As an example, if a ball deflated from 13.2 to 12.9 it wouldn't matter. But if it deflated from 12.5 to 12.3 it would ‚Äì as an example. We will take steps in the future to make sure that we don't put ourselves in that type of potential situation again. 

The National Football League is investigating this situation. We have cooperated fully, quickly and completely with every request that they have made; [we] continue to be cooperative in any way that we can. I have no explanation for what happened. That's what they're looking into. So I can't comment on what they're doing. That's something that you should talk to them about. 

Again, my overall knowledge of football specifications, the overall process that happens on game day with the footballs is very limited. I would say that during the course of the game, I honestly never ‚Äì it probably has happened on an incomplete pass or something ‚Äì but I've never touched a game ball. It's not something I have any familiarity with on that. 

Again, I was completely and totally unaware of any of this that we're talking about in the last couple days until Monday morning. Based on what I knew Sunday, Sunday night, thinking back on this, which I've done several times, [I] really can't think of anything that I would have done differently, based on what I knew then, based on what I know now. I told you the one change we would make in the initial start level of the football pressure, but that's really about it. 

It's unfortunate that this is a story coming off of two great playoff victories by our football team and our players. But again, we've been cooperative with the NFL investigation. We'll continue to do so and we will turn all our attention and focus on to the Seattle Seahawks, a very well coached, talented, tough, competitive football team. 

We've spent the last four days, three days, with our preparations and so forth for the trip. I think those are coming to a conclusion. We're wrapping that up and we're starting our preparations today with the Seahawks and practicing through the weekend. We'll have a good, solid opportunity to get ourselves ready to go before we head down there. 

Again, I have no further comment on the NFL investigation and I've told you all I know about the subject from my perspective. That's where we are. 

Q: Aside from the NFL investigation, in your own investigation, did you find whether anyone willfully ‚Äì 

BB: I've told you everything I know. 

Q: What do you say to your critics? 

BB: I have nothing ‚Äì I don't have an explanation. 

Q: Not withstanding what you've said here today, there are a lot people who are questioning your integrity, saying you will win at all costs. 

BB: I've told you everything I know. 

Q: What do you say to critics who are challenging your character, which seems to go well beyond the sport of football? 

BB: I've told you everything I know. 

Q: Any message to the fans who are watching all of this and are upset by this? 

BB: I've told them everything I know. There's nothing else I can add to it. 

Q: What have you talked to Tom Brady about? I assume you've had conversations with Tom about this issue and what happened. 

BB: I have no explanation for what happened. 

Q: Why do you think these controversies continue to follow you? 

BB: I don't have any explanation for what happened. 

Q: As many Super Bowls as you've been to, you know distractions come with the territory. What do you say to your younger players who don't have the experience being in this spotlight like this as some of the older players? 

BB: None of them are involved in this. 

Q: How do you keep them focused though, with all this going on? 

BB: None of them are involved in this. 

Q: Does Tom Brady handle the ball after inspection with his ball boys? 

BB: Those are all questions that should be directed to the league and that's part of what they're doing. That's not what I'm doing. 

Q: Is it possible that someone on your sideline, even though you may not know about it, might have deliberately altered the balls? 

BB: I don't have any explanation for what happened. I've told you all I can tell you from my point of view and anything coming from the investigative side, from the league, needs to be directed toward them. 

Q: Why would you want to overinflate the balls [in the future] unless you think that somehow it [deflation] happens naturally? 

BB: So there is no opportunity for a small margin of error that would put us under the specifications. 

Q: Do you see any circumstances under which 11 of 12 footballs could have accidentally deflated? 

BB: I don't have any explanation for what happened. 

Q: Knowing how much you care about what's going on, what's it been like for you since you found out about the investigation and what's it been like trying to deal with everything going on? 

BB: Well as I said, I've learned a lot about the process. I had no idea how the balls got from the officials locker room down on the field and so forth and so on and all of that. That's not something I have ever thought or concerned myself about [on] game day. I've concerned myself with preparing and coaching the team. So some of the things like that that have been talked about, that have happened, I mean, I'm totally unaware of., Out my airplane windows...one day, three cities:

(Not pictured: all the coffee I needed to get through all those time zones), Fantastic interview today with Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll, on the value of daring to be different. Will air Super Bowl weekend on the CNN/Bleacher Report special I'm hosting. 

Of course...we also talked #DeflateGate. Here's an excerpt:

Rachel Nichols: How significant is it if the Patriots are found to have participated in cheating the rules?

Pete Carroll: Well I don't know all of that answer right now, and I don't know about the circumstances, so it would be crazy for me to comment on it, but we're trying to do things right.  We want to do things the right way.  And I'm sure that pervades the league and all of that, so we'll see what happens with that.

Nichols: As an NFL head coach, you are one of the 32 stewards of the game.  How important is it that coaches relentlessly protect the integrity of the game?

Carroll: I think it is ultimately, absolutely important.  We've seen the power of the league and how at every turn of issues that have come up one right after another, people have looked to the league for leadership.  And for the kind of guidance, and the kind of wisdom that's necessary to make these great choices -  well there's another opportunity again.  Of course we want to do it right.  We want to do everything the best way we can possibly do it for all the right reasons.  Not just because it's football or because we're coaches. But for all the right reasons. And you can see us working to figure that all out. You can see the league, and the league office working to figure out what is right, and let's stand for what's right. And when we make our mistakes we admit to them and we fix the situation and we send the message that that's the right way to do things.  And so we'll see what happens with this., Indianapolis Colts Pat McAfee having a little fun from the NFL Pro Bowl, Welcome headline at 5:30a..., Here's a good summary of what's being reported so far on the New England Patriots football #Deflategate, The last line of this story...

#######

STATEMENT RELEASED ON BEHALF OF ADRIAN PETERSON

The report that I backed out of a meeting with the NFL is just not true. When Roger Goodell's office asked that I attend the ‚Äúhearing‚Äù on Friday, I consulted with my union and learned that this ‚Äúhearing‚Äù was something new and inconsistent with the CBA. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of this past week, my union sent emails, letters, and had conversations with his office on my behalf asking about the nature of the hearing, how it was to occur, who would participate, and its purpose. We repeatedly asked them to respond quickly to my questions because I want to cooperate and get back on the field, but they didn't respond until late Wednesday evening, and even then they didn't answer important questions about their proposed ‚Äúhearing.‚Äù

After consulting with the union, I told the NFL that I will attend the standard meeting with the Commissioner prior to possible imposition of discipline, as has been the long-term practice under the CBA, but I wouldn‚Äôt participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline ‚Äúhearing‚Äù that would include outside people I don't know and who would have roles in the process that the NFL wouldn't disclose.  At this point, I've resolved my matter in the criminal court; I've worked to make amends for what I've done; I've missed most of the season, and I stand ready to be candid and forthcoming with Mr. Goodell about what happened. However, I will not allow the NFL to impose a new process of discipline on me, ignore the CBA, ignore the deal they agreed to with me, and behave without fairness or accountability.  The process they are pushing is arbitrary, inconsistent, and contrary to what they agreed to do, and for those reasons, I never agreed to the hearing.

I'm sorry for all of this, but I can't excuse their refusal to be fair.

#####

My attorney has asked me not to discuss the facts of my pending case. I hope you can respect that request and help me honor it. I very much want the public to hear from me but I understand that it is not appropriate to talk about the facts in detail at this time. Nevertheless, I want everyone to understand how sorry I feel about the hurt I have brought to my child.
I never wanted to be a distraction to the Vikings organization, the Minnesota community or to my teammates. I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son.

I voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had. Before my grand jury appearance, I was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney. In each of these interviews I have said the same thing, and that is that I never ever intended to harm my son. I will say the same thing once I have my day in court. 

I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen. I know that many people disagree with the way I disciplined my child. I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate.
I have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward. But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives. I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man. I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make.

I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser. I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury. No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that‚Äôs what I tried to do that day.

I accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct. Regardless of what others think, however, I love my son very much and I will continue to try to become a better father and person., Here's the Vikings' statement on why they are reinstating Adrian Peterson to play this Sunday:, Thrilled the public's voice was heard this week.

Frank Vogel added that the Pacers' ability to deal with rough waters comes back to character: "Back when we had troubles with our image 5-6, 7 years ago, Larry Bird started from scratch saying we are going to bring in high character people, and not just guys who don‚Äôt get in trouble, but who are able to handle things like that.

- He said "the first order of business is just to settle everyone down, and get everyone back to doing our jobs. There will be some disturbance in the force from time to time, but that‚Äôs not going to affect us. That‚Äôs going to be the NBA‚Äôs job to work through the turbulence of these ownership issues." 

- He believes he was chosen because the NBA was looking for "someone who was not a usual suspect," that the league "wanted someone with some broad-based experience at a high level, knowledge and integrity." He added that having played basketball at the University of Hawaii didn't hurt, although when I asked him how good a player he was, he joked that his old coach recently answered that same question by saying Parsons "tried really hard." 

- Parsons also told me that while him being African-American certainly won't affect his decisions or relationships, "symbolically, it could affect the way people see the Commissioner's commitment to this, which is significant."

- Parsons said Adam Silver first contacted him about the job on Monday. His acceptance was finalized yesterday, and he will be in LA at the start of next week to begin working with the team, although he has already spoken via telephone with Doc Rivers and a few others in the organization. I asked him who he will report to, and he said he will be operating as both the Interim CEO and the "owner proxy for everything but the sale of the team," so he will have relative autonomy., Johnny Manziel on the possibility of going to Dallas: "I don't think the world could have handled that, honestly.", This ESPN graphic is pretty incredible.

NEW YORK, April 29, 2014 ‚Äì NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has banned Donald Sterling for life from any association with the Clippers or the NBA, it was announced today at a press conference in Manhattan.

Commissioner Silver has also fined Mr. Sterling $2.5 million, the maximum amount allowed under the NBA Constitution. The fine money will be donated to organizations dedicated to anti-discrimination and tolerance efforts that will be jointly selected by the NBA and the Players Association.

As part of the lifetime ban, Mr. Sterling may not attend any NBA games or practices, be present at any Clippers office or facility, or participate in any business or player personnel decisions involving the team. He will also be barred from attending NBA Board of Governors meetings and participating in any other league activity.

Commissioner Silver also announced that he will urge the Board of Governors to exercise its authority to force a sale of the team.

The discipline issued today is based on the Commissioner‚Äôs conclusion that Mr. Sterling violated league rules through his expressions of offensive and hurtful views, the impact of which has been widely felt throughout the league.

A transcript of Commissioner Silver‚Äôs press conference will be issued this afternoon and posted on the NBA‚Äôs media website (mediacentral.nba.com)., If you're not near a TV, here is the live stream of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's press conference: 
, This will be Adam Silver's view during today's press conference, Still dark...goodbye Charlotte..., Ah, how times change. Then...and now..., And the clock strikes midnight: Bye bye Bobcats. Charlotte out of the playoffs, and officially back to being the Hornets. New logo, old colors...gotta love that purple and teal, Echoing Clippers yesterday, Heat came out for warmups tonight, threw logo shirts down at midcourt & wore warm ups inside out. Heat players made clear they are not upset with their own team ownership; Micky Arison actually 1st owner to come out & condemn recording of Sterling. But w/inside-out shirts, wanted to show support of Clips players, and show that until addressed, Sterling is an issue for all., Officials here at #Heat-#Bobcats, being all official..., These playoffs, man..., President Obama was asked about Donald Sterling in his press conference in Malaysia. 

Obama replied: "I don‚Äôt think I have to interpret those statements for you -- they kind of speak for themselves. When people ‚Äì when ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance you don‚Äôt really have to do anything you just let them talk. And that‚Äôs what happened here. I have confidence that the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, a good man, will address this. Obviously the NBA is a league that is beloved by fans all across the country. It‚Äôs got an awful lot of African American players, it‚Äôs steeped in African American culture, and I suspect that the NBA is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this.
 
I will make just one larger comment about this. You know we ‚Äì the US continues to wrestle with the legacy of race, and slavery, and segregation. That‚Äôs still there‚Ä¶ the vestiges of discrimination. We‚Äôve made enormous strides but you know you‚Äôre going to continue to see this percolate up every so often and I think we just have to be clear and steady in denouncing it, teaching our children differently, but also remaining hopeful that part of why some statements like this stand out so much is because there have been a shift ‚Äì there has been this shift in how we view ourselves. And like Malaysia, we constantly have to be on guard against racial attitudes that divide us rather than embracing our diversity as a strength. And I know that people of Malaysia are committed to wrestling with those issues as well. We have to make sure that we stay on top of it. And we will.", Side note on Clippers story: Donald Sterling was scheduled to be given lifetime achievement award by Los Angeles NAACP next month, Vincent Lamar Carter. 37 years young.
Wow., Very strong stuff from LeBron James in response to tape of Clippers owner: "‚ÄúIf the reports are true, it‚Äôs unacceptable. There is no room for Donald Sterling in our league." Also: "I believe in [new NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver, I believe in the NBA and they have to do something and do something very fast and quickly before this really gets out of hand.", Statement from LA Clippers President Andy Roeser on Donald Sterling below. Do you buy it?

‚ÄúWe have heard the tape on TMZ. We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.' Mr. Sterling is emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect his views, beliefs or feelings. It is the antithesis of who he is, what he believes and how he has lived his life. He feels terrible that such sentiments are being attributed to him and apologizes to anyone who might have been hurt by them.

"He is also upset and apologizes for sentiments attributed to him about Earvin Johnson. He has long considered Magic a friend and has only the utmost respect and admiration for him - both for who he is and what he has acheived. We are investigating this matter.", Pre-game meetings with the coaches. Join us at 2p for #Pacers v #Hawks on @NBAonTNT - I'll be working on the sideline, #Pacers' Roy Hibbert will start.

As for his foot, he said it was actually feeling great at the game's start, but late in the 1st Q he felt his plantar fascia "rip all the way through." Excruciating pain after that for the rest of the game., Interviewed LeBron James on the court postgame, he shrugged off whether that Josh McRoberts forearm he got to the neck should have been a flagrant: "it's the playoffs." Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra not as understanding. When asked whether he got an explanation from the refs, he said "nothing that seemed rational to me.", Waiting for Al Jefferson in the #Bobcats locker room...one boot, one shoe., NFL (finally) releases the schedule for next season.

#SB48 #FBWatch, Archie and Cooper Manning
#SB48 #FBWatch, After his now-infamous NFC Championship outburst, I asked Richard Sherman what he'd say on the field postgame if the Seahawks won the Super Bowl. Here's the transcript:

RACHEL NICHOLS:
If you win the Super Bowl, and someone sticks a microphone in your face right afterward, in the moment - and by the way, they will - what are you gonna say this time?

RICHARD SHERMAN:
I'm goin' to Disneyland. (LAUGH) And I hope it doesn't offend anybody and they - they don't go after my life like they did last time.

RACHEL NICHOLS:
Seriously - are you gonna be more careful?

RICHARD SHERMAN:
No. No, I'm not - I'm not gonna be more careful. I'm obviously not gonna attack another person. You know, I definitely think that was wrong. But I am who I am. You know, I can't be anybody else. I don't know how to be anybody else. And I wasn't raised to be anybody else. I don't think I'm a bad person, and I never have cruel intentions - off the field. But you can't - you know, you gotta be who you are. That's what has gotten us here, and if it's worked this for long. We'll see if it'll work again.

#SB48 #FBWatch, Not bad, Bruno Mars. Still, best halftime show I've seen in person remains Prince doing Purple Rain...in the rain.

#SB48 #FBWatch, Whoa...HUGE pass interference call there. Defender never turned his head around, gonna get called for that every time (well, almost...)
#SB48  #FBWatch, Okay Denver Broncos fans, how's the heart rate doing? 
#SB48  #FBWatch, Time of possession so far: Seattle Seahawks 10:25, Denver Broncos 2:02. Big part of SEA strategy: Keep Peyton off the field.

- WR James Jones: "You never sat out when you were undefeated in Pop Warner. You play the games, so it‚Äôs no different now"
- WR Donald Driver: "The last 2 games are big rivals we don‚Äôt want to lose against...Chicago, Detroit...our fans would be upset for a long time."
- QB Aaron Rodgers: "We‚Äôre going to trust Coach and his decision, whatever it might be, but all of us as players just want to keep playing."
