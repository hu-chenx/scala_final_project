As humans we feel emotions. With this awareness, when we feel unhappy, we have the ability to move through the uncomfortable emotions and like papa says, we will not punish ourselves a thousand times for the same mistake." ~Don Jose Ruiz
"La primera regla del arte de la felicidad es que no somos felices todo el tiempo. Como seres humanos sentimos emociones. Con esta conciencia, cuando nos sentimos infelices, tenemos la capacidad de movernos a través de las emociones incómodas y, como dice papá, no nos castigaremos a nosotros mismos mil veces por el mismo error." ~don José Ruiz, Live interview with Don Jose Ruiz, starts right now at 12 PST!

Comunícate con los demás tan claramente como sea posible para evitar malentendidos, tristeza y drama. Si todos los seres humanos se comunicaran con la impecabilidad de la palabra, todas nuestras relaciones cambiarían. No habría guerras, ni violencia, ni malentendidos. With Amber-Allen Publishing, Inc., The power of our word is behind every agreement that we make.

http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/in-my-own-words-by-don-miguel-ruiz-audio/, The only way to control the emotions is by accepting ourselves just the way we are.  

La única forma de controlar las emociones es aceptándonos a nosotros mismos tal y como somos., Real love is accepting other people the way they are without trying to change them. If we try to change them, this means that we don’t really like them. It is easier to find someone who is already the way you want him or her to be, instead of trying to change that person.
El verdadero amor es aceptar a otras personas como son, sin tratar de cambiarlos. Si tratamos de cambiarlas, esto significa que no nos gustan de verdad.

Más información: http://bit.ly/1EjfuCr, When we fulfill the needs of our mind and our body, our eyes see with love.  We see God everywhere.  We even see God behind the parasite of other people. 

Cuando satisfacemos las necesidades de nuestra mente y de nuestro cuerpo, nuestros ojos ven con amor. Vemos a Dios en todas partes. Vemos a Dios detrás del parásito de otras personas., Assumptions are made so fast and unconsciously most of the time because we have agreements to communicate this way. We have agreed that it is not safe to ask questions; we have agreed that if people love us, they should know what we want or how we feel.
Las suposiciones se hacen tan rápido e inconsciente la mayor parte del tiempo porque tenemos acuerdos de comunicarnos de esta manera. Hemos acordado que no es seguro hacer preguntas; hemos acordado que si la gente nos aman, deben saber lo que queremos o cómo nos sentimos. With Amber-Allen Publishing, Inc., As you make it a habit not taking anything personally, you won't need to place your trust in what others do or say.

Pocos lugares disponibles!, The biggest assumption that humans make is that everyone sees
life the way we do. We assume that others think the way we think, feel the way we feel, judge the way we judge, and abuse the way we abuse. We are afraid to be ourselves around others because we think others will judge us, victimize us, abuse us, and blame us as we do ourselves.
La mayor suposición que los seres humanos hacen es que todo el mundo ve la vida de la manera en que nosotros lo hacemos. Suponemos que los demás piensan de la manera en que pensamos, sienten lo que sentimos, juzgan de la misma forma que nosotros juzgamos, y abusan de la forma que nosotros abusamos. Tenemos miedo de ser nosotros mismos porque pensamos que los demás nos juzgarán, nos victimizarán, nos abusarán, y culparán como lo hacemos con nosotros mismos., The problem with making assumptions is that we believe they are the truth.  

El problema de hacer suposiciones es que creemos que son verdad., Do not be concerned about the future; keep your attention on today, and stay in the present moment. 

No te preocupes por el futuro, mantén tu atención en el día de hoy y permanece en el momento presente., In any kind of relationship, we can make the assumption that others know what we think, and we don’t have to say what we want. We assume they are going to do what we want because they know us so well. If they don’t do what we want, we feel hurt and think, How could you do that? You should know.
En cualquier tipo de relación, podemos hacer la suposición de que los demás saben lo que pensamos, y no tenemos que decir lo que queremos. Suponemos que van a hacer lo que queremos porque nos conocen tan bien. Si ellos no hacen lo que queremos, nos sentimos heridos y pensamos, ¿Cómo pudiste hacer eso? Debías haberlo sabido.

Cuando te rehusas a tomarte las cosas como algo personal, evitas muchos disgustos en tu vida., It is always better to ask questions than to make assumptions. Have the courage to ask questions until you are as clear as you can be. Once you hear the answer to a question, you won’t have to make assumptions because you will know the truth.
Siempre es mejor hacer preguntas que hacer suposiciones. Ten el valor de hacer preguntas hasta que esté tan claro como puede ser. Una vez que escuches la respuesta a una pregunta, no tendrás que hacer suposiciones porque sabrás la verdad. With Amber-Allen Publishing, Inc., Whatever happens around you, don't take it personally. 

No tomes como algo personal lo que suceda a tu alrededor., Making assumptions is a setup for suffering because usually we gossip about our assumptions. We make assumptions and believe we are right, then we defend our assumptions and try to make others wrong.
Hacer suposiciones es una trampa para sufrir porque normalmente chismeamos sobre nuestras suposiciones. Hacemos suposiciones y creemos que estamos bien, entonces defendemos nuestras suposiciones y tratamos de probar que los demás están equivocados., Being impeccable with your word is not using the word against yourself.  

Ser impecable con tus palabras es no usar las palabras en contra de ti mismo., During our domestication, our parents and siblings gave their opinions about us without even thinking.  We believed those opinions and we lived in fear over these opinions. 

Durante nuestra domesticación, nuestros padres y hermanos nos dieron sus opiniones sobre nosotros sin ni siquiera pensarlo.  Nosotros creímos esas opiniones y vivimos con miedo a ellas., The problem with making assumptions is that we believe they are the truth.

 recover the power of my faith, my will is free again, and what I can do
 with that has no limits., The way to transform what you believe about yourself is to unlearn, what you have learned.When you unlearn, your faith returns to you, your personal power increases, and you can invest your faith in new beliefs., Faith
 is the force that gives life to every word, to every belief that we 
store in our mind. If we agree with a concept, our faith is there, and 
we keep it in our memory. Faith is the mortar that holds our beliefs 
together and gives sense and direction to the entire dream., Hi, sorry for any strange posts. Looks like someone got into our system, time to change passwords and such. Hope you are all having a great evening and all of my love, Miguel A. Ruiz Jr., The word is pure magic. The power of our word comes directly from God, and faith is the force that directs this power.

Even if I feel anger or hate, there is always a reason for feeling it. Every emotion comes directly from the integrity of my spirit., It is always better to ask questions than to make assumptions.

I am a secondary character in other people's stories. I know that whatever people say about me is just a projection of their image of me. It has nothing to do with me.~don Miguel Ruiz, I change my story by changing what I believe about myself. When I clean up the lies I believe about myself, the lies I believe other people change. Every time I change myself, my whole story changes to adapt to the new main character.~don Miguel Ruiz, Everything  I believe about myself is just a story. In my story, 
everything is  about me, and it has to be that way because I am the 
center of my  perception. The story is told from my point of view.~don 
Miguel Ruiz, Respect  is one of the greatest expressions of love. If other people try

made  by images of light. The story I create is a virtual reality that 
is only  true for me, the one who creates it.~don Miguel Ruiz, I

moves the stars is the same force that moves the atoms in my body. This 
force is always present and obvious for me to see, but I cannot see it

because I'm inseparable from the infinite, the force of life that  
creates the stars and the entire universe of light.~ don Miguel Ruiz, Everything

If you are aware of your own beauty and accept your own beauty, the opinion of others doesn't affect you at all., null, The
 whole world can love you, but that love will not make you happy. What 
will make you happy is to share all the love you have inside you. That

 little children, we are completely authentic. Our actions are guided by
 our instinct and emotions; we listen to the silent voice of our 
integrity. Nobody teaches us to be that way; we are born that way. ~ don Miguel Ruiz, Taking things personally makes you prey for predators. They can hook your attention with one little opinion, and feed you whatever poison they want. ~ don Miguel Ruiz, Whatever
 people do, feel, think, or say, don't take it personally. Others are

mastery is with practice. To master a relationship is therefore, about

We know that every artist has the right to create his own art.~ don Miguel Ruiz, When
 we try to describe the truth with words, we distort it, and it's no 
longer truth ~ it's our story. The story may be true for us, but that 
doesn't mean it is true for anyone else.~ don Miguel Ruiz, If
 we invest our faith in a lie, that lie becomes truth for us. If we 
believe we are not good enough, then thy will be done ~ we are not good 
enough. If we believe we will fail, we will fail, because that is the 
power and magic of our faith. ~ don Miguel Ruiz, "Believing in lies creates injustice, fear and suffering ~ not only in the individual, but also in society." don Miguel Ruiz - The Voice of Knowledge, null, null, null, null, null, Miguel Ruiz Jr is getting ready to do his show "The Way of the Desert", at Noon Pacific, 2:00pm Central.

no necesitamos a nadie que nos domestique. Somos un ser 
auto-domesticado.

Being has nothing to do with knowledge. It’s not about understanding. You don’t need to understand. It’s not about learning. You are here to unlearn, and that’s it, until one day you realize you know nothing. You only know what you believe, what you learned, just to find out that it wasn’t the truth.” don Miguel Ruiz ~ The Fifth Agreement, This May choose to step into the labyrinth, to see your creation and

Don Miguel Ruiz-The Four Agreements, "Encuentra el valor para pedir lo que quieres.  Los otros tienen el derecho de decirte si o no, pero tú siempre tienes el derecho a pedir.  De igual manera, todos tienen el derecho a pedirte lo que quieren y tú tienes el derecho de decir si o no."

Don Miguel Ruiz -The Fifth Agreement, "Todo lo que sabes, tu realidad completa está hecha de símbolos. Pero tú no eres ese montón de símbolos que hablan en tu cabeza.  Tú lo sabes y por eso eres escéptico y no te crees a ti mismo." Don Miguel Ruiz - El Quinto Acuerdo, ""We can respect what each of us believes and know that each of us is dreaming our own dream that has nothing to do with anyone else.  Just by having this awareness, we are taking a big step toward healing the mind."

Cuando te vuleves sabio, respetas tu cuerpo, respetas tu mente y respetas tu alma.  Cuando te vuelves sabio, tu vida está controlada por tu corazón, no por tu cabeza." Don Miguel Ruiz - La Maestría del Amor, "You don't need to accumulate knowledge to become wise, anyone can become wise.  When you become wise, you respect your body, you respect your mind, and you respect your soul.  When you become wise, your life is controlled by your heart, not your head."

Don Miguel Ruiz - Cuaderno de Trabajo de Los Cuatro Acuerdos, "Cada vez que intentamos ser lo que no somos, fracasamos.  Es muy difícil fingir que somos lo que no somos.  Vivir de esa manera es un verdadero y profundo infierno.  Es un engaño, una situación en la que no es posible ganar.  Sólo puedes ser TU, y ya está. Eres TU ahora mismo, y no tienes que hacer ningún esfuerzo para serlo." Don Miguel Ruiz - La Voz del Conocimiento, "Any time that we try what we are not, we fail It's so difficult to pretend what we are not.  Living like that is truly a deep hell.  It's a setup, it's a no-win situation.  You can only be YOU, and that's it.  And you are YOU right now, and it's effortless." Don Miguel Ruiz - The Voice of Knowledge, "Focus your attention on what you're feeling right now. Feel the desire to be alive, the desire of love and joy, the desire to create something wonderful to share it with everyone around you.  The greatest mission that has been given to you is to make yourself happy and to share your love and joy." Don Miguel Ruiz - Prayers, "Doubt is the tool we use to recover our faith, to take our power back from every lie and superstition we believe in, and return the power to ourselves.  Then, instead of doubting yourself, have faith in yourself.  Instead of doubting the truth, doubt the lies." Don Miguel Ruiz - The Fifth Agreement, "When you are truthful with yourself, you start to see everything as it is, not the way you want to see it.  The wounds in your emotional body are covered by the denial system.  When you look at your wounds with the eyes of truth, you can finally heal those wounds."  Don Miguel Ruiz - The Mastery of Love, "Whaever life takes away from you, let it go.  When you surrender and let go of the past, you allow yourself to be fully alive in the moment.  Letting go of the past means that you can enjoy the dream that is happening right now."  Don Miguel Ruiz - The Four Agreements, "I see the REAL you, not what you pretend to be, because I know it is not YOU.  The real you is your presence, and it's as beautiful and wonderful as anything on this earth."  Don Miguel Ruiz - The Fifth Agreement, "If we are fighting with the pople we love, if we're creating a lot of resitance around us, remember, we live in a world of consequences.  We have to forgive, because forgivness is the only way to clear our body of emotional posion". Don Miguel Ruiz - The Fifth Agreement, "The quality of your communication depends on whether you tune your emotional body to love or to fear.  If you know what love is and what fear is, you become aware of the way you communicate your dream to others, and you can choose to communicate with love."  Don Miguel Ruiz - The Mastery of Love, "Faith is the power of creation that all humans have. If we invest our faith in a lie, that lie becomes truth for us.  If we believe we are not good enough, then thy will be done-we are not good enough. If we believe we will fail, we will fail, because that is the powe and magic of our faith."
