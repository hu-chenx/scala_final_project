This is a huge honor, although being a chef might seem glamorous , in actuality, a tremendous amount of hard work and sacrifice goes into it. 
I also would like to thank all the great chef's, sous chef's, line cooks, prep cooks and dishwashers that have worked with us over the last three years.  It blows me away how much talent has come through the kitchens of Strip's and Ribelle  since Tim moved to Boston.
