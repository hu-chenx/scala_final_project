"I think camel, definitely. You know how with lamb, you have to have a cabernet to kind of clean it? It had that component to it. It was so rich. Part of it was the style in which we cooked it, with butter, and it's also that it has a high fat content, so it had that sort of coating. You really went, 'Wow, this is beefy.' There's also the yak flatiron, which was very unique because it picked up the grill flavor amazingly. It tasted like brazilian barbecue without doing all of the work ‚Äî just beefy."

Cheryl Fenton: The Tip Tap just had it‚Äôs first birthday. How does that make you feel, proud papa?

"It has been the most incredible year. I opened two restaurants and I‚Äôve met so many great people in this neighborhood and in the South End. It‚Äôs been an amazing experience. I feel like I‚Äôve gotten a restaurant degree in the past year. But there‚Äôs so much more to learn. 

I don't want to slow down. About a month and a half before I opened The Tip Tap Room, I said to my wife, ‚ÄòHoney, once I get this restaurant open I promise I‚Äôll settle down.‚Äô She said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve known you for seven years, and you aren‚Äôt going to settle down.‚Äô I was like, ‚ÄòOK, good you understand me.‚Äô 

I‚Äôve found what I love. I‚Äôve always loved cooking. All these notes pads in my office are still ideas going. It used to be, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôll save that idea for elsewhere.‚Äô Now it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs do that idea here.‚Äô I don't consider it work.

Review: "The Tip Tap Room has a pretty interesting and intriguing menu especially if you like meat variety and are near the North End, Downtown or Beacon Hill areas. They have a wild game special that changes daily and a variety of tips to choose from (steak, lamb, turkey, chicken, swordfish, tofu). There's no outdoor seating, but they do open the wall to wall windows on warm days which is almost as good. More importantly they have 36 beers on tap.", Thank you, Boston.com for the love! We're one of their picks for best beer bars in Boston: http://ow.ly/nEkVk
