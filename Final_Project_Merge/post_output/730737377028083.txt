List(Our popup experience at Tamper has come to an end. It was a fantastic experience where we learned a lot about the product here in the US.  We want to thank our hosts at Tamper for a great time and for the opportunity to introduce our dish to the american taste buds. And thank you to all of you for your comments and suggestions and, of course, for trying Tlacuani!
