Thank you, Thank you EVERYONE for such an amazing outpouring of support for our challenge last night. Here is what happened;

We were cooking KC style Burnt ends on the wood fired rotisserie and the fat caught fire, igniting into the hood system. This set off our Ansul and then the fun began. Our team did an amazing job of clearing the restaurant and using the fire extinguisher to suppress the flames. This happened in seconds, I'm so proud of our amazing team and how they reacted calmly and cool. No one was hurt and we are grateful for our Local fire and health department for working with us to get back up and running quickly. 

We hope to see you all here soon to share some food and drink! Thank you again so much for the continued support and LOVE!

To be clear, the word ” delicatessen” in Moody’s moniker is not meant to imply eats of the kosher Jewish variety (though after a bite of the piled-high pastrami sandwich or peppery corned-beef version, you may be convinced otherwise). No, this Waltham destination sets out to celebrate every kind of animal protein, with the most astonishing breadth of fastidiously house-cured and smoked meats you’ll find anywhere in the area (all of which, of course, still pair perfectly with a side of house bagel chips and a can of Dr. Brown’s cream soda).
