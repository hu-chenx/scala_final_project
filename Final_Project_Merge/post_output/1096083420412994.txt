#temptingtuesdays, Our Milton location (24 Central Ave) is looking for local artists who would like to display their art work on our walls.  
(We are not open yet but plan to be very soon).

This is how it works....
-Send us a link to your work.  It can be here, (FB), twitter, Instagram, or email: info@coffeebreakcafe.net
-We are a family friendly business so your work must reflect that.
-We have frame holders so your work can safely lean on our walls.  -We ask that you put your work up on the first of the month and take it down on the last day of the month.
-We do not take a percentage of any sales. (we just like to support local).
-Because we do not take a percentage of your sales, we accept cash or check only for it because credit card companies charge us for all transactions.
-We ask that if you are selling your work, your price and contact info is clearly marked and please do not put tape on our walls.
-We are not responsible for lost or stolen work. 

That's all!  We look forward to putting together a monthly schedule! :-), Roll a 2, pay 2 cents!!!

#coffeebreakcafe #happyanniversarycoffeebreak #frozenfriday, null, 20 years!  Yahoooo!!!  Thank you Quincy!! Xoxo ❤️, Please share 😍, Saturday 2/27/16 from 7am-5pm will be our last day in business at 247 Atlantic St. in North Quincy after 9 year WONDERFUL years!

We are so very sad to be leaving there.  Our current landlords have decided to open their own coffee shop in our space and have forced us out of that location.

I remember 10 years ago expressing doubt about that location.  I thought that there wasn't enough parking, wasn't enough visibility and it was right smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  We turned the space down initially.

A few months later the original landlord approached us again and showed us the potential this beautiful brick building with the gigantic floor to ceiling windows actually had.  The original owner said they were going to be a more upscale convenience store with a nice beer and wine selection, a good pizza place, dry cleaning drop off and pick up and Coffee Break Cafe.  It would be a local, community type place with excellent product and customer service all under one roof.

It worked for a long time.  7 years to be exact.  This is the one location of the 6 total that Jenn and Donny Ormond have opened together that they were shocked at how busy it was since the beginning.  We remember on opening day, we still had a bunch of little things to do like hanging shelves and things like that, but we couldn't get to it because there were too many people in line.  It was our smallest location, strictly take out but super busy!

Then the original owner fell upon some hard times.  He lost the building :-(.

We stayed open.  It was bank-owned.  We had 275 tiny square feet in this 6,000 square foot building.  It was kind of cold, dark and lonely but our customers kept on coming and we survived and grew.

Finally the bank sold the building at auction and the current owners purchased it.  We had a bad feeling about them when we met them.  We wish we listened to that bad feeling and left then, but we stuck it out for our customers.  We were still chasing that dream of that local community feel.  

Perhaps they will achieve that local community feeling again, but they will be doing it without Coffee Break.  We are devastated to leave that spot, but relieved to no longer have to share space with the current owners.

Coffee Break Cafe has pride in who we do business with and how we do business.  We recycle, compost and give back to our community.  We live and work within our values.  We only do business with other like minded companies.  We are happy to not have any association with the current owner of 247 Atlantic St.  We do not wish ill will on anybody, but are grateful to not be in a business relationship with them.

We will miss our regular every day customers, we hope you will visit us at our other locations!  Thanks for helping us do what we do. <3, Story time with Big Joe the Storyteller had to be cancelled this Friday night at 12 Old Colony ave at 6:15!
Sorry about that!, We are being forced out of this location (247 Atlantic Street) by the owners of this building who have decided to run their own coffee shop in our space.
Our last day of business will be this Saturday, February 27th 2016.

http://www.coffeebreakcafe.net/, Eggnog latte's are dangerous...., CBC has shopped local since we opened.  It makes sense to eat bagels made a few miles down the street made from a family owned business that uses locally sourced ingredients.  There are only a handful of products that we sell that aren't local.  We employ local people and service local customers.  Shopping local keeps the money spent, in your community only making it stronger.  Shopping local is easy to do and it just makes sense.  Have fun today exploring other local businesses!, Black Friday at CBC:
Purchase $100.00 gift certificate and receive a bonus $25.00 gift certificate. 
Purchase $50.00 gift certificate and receive 3 drink of choice cards.
Purchase $25.00 gift certificate and receive 1 drink of choice card.
These deals will be honored in store and on-line until Sunday 12/1/13....
http://www.coffeebreakcafe.net/shop/, We are so very grateful to our unbelievably dedicated customers who without, we would not be here.  So we thank you.
We are equally grateful to our hardworking, dedicated, awesomely amazing Coffee Break staff.  (Aren't they the best?)
Happy Thanksgiving to all!, Happy Thanksgiving!
We are open today in Wollaston (12 Old Colony ave) and in North Quincy (247 Atlantic at)
from 7-3.....  Have a wonderful day!!, This just came in as an urgent email..... 

 Dear Friends,

 The Germantown Neighborhood Center has been giving out Thanksgiving dinner to our most needy residents for years now and this year we desperately need your help. The Greater Boston Food Bank was able to give us 260 turkeys. However, we expect 200 families to pick up their Thanksgiving dinner today and another 200 families tomorrow. Our donations have diminished and at this moment we have no gift cards or turkeys to give out.

 I can be reached at kquigley@ssymca.org, or you can call me on my cell 857-891-0378 or drop by the Community Center at 366 palmer Street. Any and all donations will be greatly appreciated. Turkeys gift cards and monetary donations should be made out the Germantown Neighborhood Center.

 Thank you and have a happy Thanksgiving.

 Kathy Quigley, Director
 Germantown Community Center, We get to pick who gets flocked next....  Taking requests, we would love to keep it in the business community for a while....
