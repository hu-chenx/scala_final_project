List(We are currently in the permitting stage for the Morrissey Blvd location. We are targeting a late spring﻿ open for the Dorchester location., As you may have noticed, they have begun construction of the new building at the Adams Plaza.  Additionally, the landlord has begun work to update the façade of Walgreen's and In Sync Center of the Arts are both open during the remodeling.  Unfortunately, we have no direct control over the work here, but our hope is that we will be able to re-open at the Quincy location in August or September., We have FINALLY signed a lease to return to the Adams Plaza!!!

2016 will now be TWICE as NICE with TWO Unchained Pizza locations!

We expect to open the Dorchester location first, in spring of 2016. With construction finally under way at Adams Plaza, we should have the Quincy location operational before the end of the year., null, We've finally signed a lease, which means we'll hopefully be pumping out pizza again by February 2016!  For more information, please check out our web page here: http://unchainedpizza.com/, We've been working hard on a few things behind the scenes, and we're getting ready to share what we've been working on...  Thank you, all, for waiting with us through the difficult times. :), For those folks who aren't on our email list for latest updates and for those who haven't checked our website (http://www.unchainedpizza.com), here is the latest news: 

We met with the landlord and their representatives on Wednesday and discussed plans for the plaza and Unchained Pizza.  We were given a rough estimate of a timeline, and it is lengthy.  At this point, if everything starts going smoothly they have now told us that the building "could be built by December".  At that point Unchained Pizza and the other stores affected will have to build out our interior spaces. 

So, in all likelihood, we will not be able to reopen until February, one year after the collapse occurred.

Unfortunately we do not have much control over the speed of the project.  We wish we had better news for all of you, and that we all could feed our Unchained Pizza hunger sooner.  As soon as we know more, we will continue to let all of you know., Missing Unchained Pizza?  Architects working on new design.  We are hoping/guessing we might re-open in September. http://ow.ly/Nakic, Friday will be the first National Dinosaur Day of 2015. But don't worry - if you forget to let your favorite dinosaur know how much he or she means to you, you'll have two more chances - one in June, and one in August - to make it up., null, Suffering from Unchained Withdrawal? You're not the only one..., Hey folks - check out our web page for more information, some pictures, and a shout-out to Charlie!

To keep up to date on developments at Adams Plaza, and our timeframe to re-open, as well as the possibility of opening at another location, please join our email list on the "Free Pizza" Page on our website: http://unchainedpizza.com/free_pizza

It will be a number of months, but when we have a better idea of when we will re-open or open at a different location, we will send an email to the list., Remember this? We do.

The original historical event was named for the small town of Delores. Here's the Wiki entry - 

"Each year on the night of September 15 at around eleven in the evening, the President of Mexico rings the bell of the National Palace in Mexico City. After the ringing of the bell, he repeats a cry of patriotism (a Grito Mexicano) based upon the "Grito de Dolores", with the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence who were there on that very historical moment included, and ending with the threefold shout of ¡Viva México! from the balcony of the palace to the assembled crowd in the Plaza de la Constitución, or Zócalo, one of the largest public plazas in the world. After the shouting, he rings the bell again and waves the Flag of Mexico to the applause of the crowd, and is followed by the playing and mass singing of the Himno Nacional Mexicano, the national anthem, with a military band from the Mexican Armed Forces playing. This event draws up to half a million spectators from all over Mexico and tourists worldwide. On the morning of September 16, or Independence Day, the national military parade in honor of the holiday starts in the Zócalo and its outskirts, passes the Hidalgo Memorial and ends on the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City’s main boulevard, passing the El Ángel memorial column and other places along the way.", The Gold Fevahh Pizza: Chicken, Jalepeños, BBQ and Honey Mustard dressing, Slice of the Day for Sat 14 Sep 2013 - Baja Chicken: Chicken, Bacon, Onion, BBQ Sauce, Chipotle Mayo, Slice of the Day for Fri 13 Sep 2013 - Buffalo Chicken: Chicken, Bleu Cheese crumbles, Buffalo Sauce, Slice of the Day for Thu 12 Sep 2013 - Meat Lovers: Pepperoni, Ham, Hamburger, Sausage, Bacon, Slice of the Day for Wed 11 Sep 2013 - Margherita: Fresh Sliced Mozzerella, Sliced Tomato, Basil, The Chicken Pesto: Chicken, Tomato & Onion on a Pesto Base, Slice of the Day for Tue 10 Sep 2013 - Hawaiian: Pineapple, Ham, Bacon, #FYI: Favorite toppings for #pizza slices in India are  pickled ginger, minced mutton & paneer cheese.

December was a busy month: there were lots of holiday celebrations for people, many of which overlapped. People  celebrated one or more, depending upon their particular taste, culture, family tradition(s) or neighborhood. We've already seen Hanukkah and Christmas; we've just finished the month with New Year's, and Kwanzaa (Dec 26 - Jan 1) is drawing to a close. 

And that's just a short listing.

Ever heard of Ashura or Pongal? Or perhaps special days like Human Rights Day, or National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day? Forefather's Day or Boxing Day?

December is also home of Wright Brother's Day, Pan American Aviation Day & AIDS Awareness Day.

You can find out more about these holidays, observances, special days & celebrations through a variety of online resources. Here's a couple to get you started:

We currently have a 4-way tie for first place in the chase for the Playoff Pizza Party:

10 Points - Dierdre M.
10 Points - M. Wayne

More about Cinco de Mayo: "Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for "fifth of May") is a celebration held on May 5. It is celebrated nationwide in the United States and regionally in Mexico, primarily in the state of Puebla, where the holiday is called El Dia de la Batalla de Puebla (English: The Day of the Battle of Puebla). The date is observed in the United States as a celebration of Mexican heritage and pride,[8] and to commemorate the cause of freedom and democracy during the first years of the American Civil War.[9] In the state of Puebla, the date is observed to commemorate the Mexican army's unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín. Contrary to widespread popular belief, Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day—the most important national patriotic holiday in Mexico—which is actually celebrated on September 16."
