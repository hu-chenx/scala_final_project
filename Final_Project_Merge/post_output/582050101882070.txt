Please click on the link below and take a few seconds to vote for him. VOTE EVERYDAY UNTIL MARCH 4th! All the support is appreciated., The Playwright and Country Sunday's own Timmy Brown was nominated for Country Artist of the Year with his band Black Diamond in the 8th Annual Limelight Magazine Reader's Poll! Please click on the link below and take a few seconds to vote for him. VOTE EVERYDAY UNTIL MARCH 4th! All the support is appreciated., WANT TO HELP SAVE LIVES? It's as easy as coming down to The Playwright tonight (7pm)! Because tonight's Bachelor Night will feature a pop up shop by Engage (a veteran owned / inspired / run clothing company based out of Boston). A portion of Engage's proceeds is donated to build fresh water wells in developing countries, and has already contributed to saving many lives! Goes to show the difference one person can make in the world. Please take a moment to read about our extraordinary friend, Nate Heilman (and take one more second to hit the SHARE button). Then come on down tonight to enjoy our Bachelor viewing, meet Nate, and help a worthy cause!

Nate Heilman is a Marine Corps veteran, published poet, and founder / CEO of Engage. Having served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, Nate became devoted to utilizing his platform to promote issues and solutions in the veteran community.
Nate‚Äôs designs are unique, and his vision - global. Engage contributes directly to One Million Goal Inc., a foundation created by a retired Marine Captain to raise money and awareness to help those in need. Nate, affected by what he witnessed first hand during deployment, decided a portion of every sale by Engage would be donated to build wells in developing countries. ‚ÄúWater is the most basic resource that some people simply don‚Äôt have access to‚Äù, says Nate. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre creating an opportunity to give that to them‚Äù.
With nearly 750 million people lacking access to clean drinking water, and over 5,000 children dying daily from water related causes, supporting Engage is something clientele can feel good about.
They can also feel good about supporting the arts, since many of Engage‚Äôs designs are hand drawn by Nate himself. Engage makes high quality original designs aimed towards adult professionals in all walks of life, yet take a closer look and you‚Äôll discover subtle tributes to the U.S. Military. Whether you're anti or pro military, I think we can all agree that building wells in underdeveloped countries is a worthy cause.
Nate is proud of his American made line, and we are proud to host Nate tonight, at 7pm. Come on down and meet this extraordinary artist and humanitarian!
