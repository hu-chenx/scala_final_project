These lesions are thought to be critical to MS progression and the researchers found that the lesions are distinctly different than previously speculated, giving clues to better disease management.

The long-accepted theory has been that MS begins in the myelin on the inner layers of the brain, also known as white matter. However, the findings of this collaborative study show the opposite -- that the disease likely can move from the outer (cortical) layers of the brain toward the white matter, offering new insight into the progression of MS.

The next step in the research is to study the lesions to uncover new molecular targets for treatment, as well as develop imaging techniques to view cortical lesions so that effects of treatment can more easily be measured., Michelle Rhee is an educational reformer whose energy and innovations are featured in the award-winning documentary ‚ÄúWaiting for Superman.‚Äù Rhee's husband is former NBA star Kevin Johnson, currently mayor of Sacramento, Calif.

Lifestyle modifications can lower blood pressure. Studies show that reducing sodium intake and increasing dietary potassium (present in fruits and vegetables) help to lower blood pressure in those who are hypertensive. Exercise and weight loss are also important strategies for blood pressure control.

Quiz provided by Drs . Marc Gillinov  and Steve Nissen of the Heart & Vascular Institute and authors of Heart 411 (http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart411book.aspx)., Heart Health Quiz: You can lower your blood pressure with:

A. A low-salt diet
B. Including more fruits and vegetables in your diet
C. Exercise
D. Weight loss if you are overweight
E. All of the above, Health Tip: Respect the Egg!

According to Jennifer Sygo, registered dietitian and Director of Nutrition at Cleveland Clinic Canada, the egg has gotten a bad reputation in recent years.

High in cholesterol, egg yolks were labelled as risky choices for those who were concerned about their hearts; recent research, however, has found that the association between egg consumption (up to seven yolks per week) and heart disease is relatively weak (the exception being those with type 2 diabetes, who seem to see an increased risk of cardiovascular events with egg consumption). 

What‚Äôs more, eggs are a good source of protein, and the yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin, two nutrients that are important for eye health, as well as choline, which is important for brain development.

How do you like your eggs?, Tammie Purcell is cherishing her baby son‚Äôs first Christmas. Mother and baby barely survived a rare complication that challenged and brought out the very best in the doctors, including Cleveland Clinic thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. Eric Roselli.
, Answer: All are false! We bust some of the more common myths about drinking:

Myth: A hot toddy can keep you warm on the slopes.
Whether you‚Äôre skiing or caroling, drinking will inhibit your body‚Äôs natural response to the stress of cold weather. Usually the body stores warm blood in its ‚Äúcore‚Äù to preserve important organ functions. With alcohol use, blood vessels in our extremities become artificially dilated, allowing warm blood to escape from the core into the peripheral circulation, where it cools. The result: the body can no longer keep vital internal organs warm, and overall body temperature drops.

Myth: A beer is less potent than a cocktail.
Whether you‚Äôre drinking a Christmas ale or an ‚Äúappletini,‚Äù beer and cocktails contain about the same amount of alcohol, and are equally potent.

Myth: Drinking coffee sobers you up when you‚Äôve had a few too many.
Coffee has no real effect on blood alcohol level, which is the major factor in determining your level of intoxication., New Year's Eve is fast approaching! Test your knowledge of alcohol with our quiz.

True or False:

A. A hot toddy can keep you warm on the slopes
B. A beer is less potent than a cocktail.
C. Drinking coffee sobers you up when you‚Äôve had a few too many., We offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends of the Mayo Clinic surgeon, medical tech, and pilot who died in a plane crash in Florida while on a mission to harvest life-saving organs. , Answer: E

Although they come in medicine containers and are shaped like "real" pills, supplements and herbal remedies are not subjected to the same level of testing and scrutiny applied to FDA-approved drugs. What this means is that manufacturers do not have to prove that supplements treat disease or improve health. In addition, quality control in the manufacture of supplements is frequently loose.

For most supplements, we don't have good evidence to support claims that they prevent disease or restore health. Don't count on them to replace a healthy lifestyle or real, proven medications.

Quiz provided by Drs . Marc Gillinov  and Steve Nissen of the Heart & Vascular Institute and authors of Heart 411 (http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart411book.aspx)., Heart Health Quiz: When it comes to vitamins and supplements:

A. More than 100 million Americans take them
B. We spend $27 billion per year purchasing them
C. They are largely unregulated (FDA approval not required)
D. They can interact with prescription medicines
E. All of the above, Answer: False!

According to our spine expert Dr. Orr, if you have back pain, no normal activity will hurt your back more. Lying around on the sofa or in bed will just cause more pain, and will affect your day to day life more than it should., True or False: If you're experiencing back pain, you should get plenty of rest., Health Tip: Omega-3 Fatty Acids - Heart Healthy Benefits

Getting enough fish in your diet could help protect you from cardiovascular disease.

Fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias and people with existing cardiovascular disease.

Omega-3 fatty acids help keep the lining of the arteries smooth and clear of damage that can lead to thickening and hardening of the arteries, as well as decrease the rate at which triglycerides are produced in the liver. Because omega-3 fatty acids lower triglyceride levels, they may also increase HDL, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol that protects against the development of heart disease. Even more, they prevent substances from accumulating and sticking to the lining of the arteries.

The American Heart Association recommends that patients without documented coronary heart disease eat a variety of fatty fish and aim for at least two servings per week (total of at least 6 ounces). Good choices include salmon, herring, blue fin tuna, sardines, anchovies, swordfish, trout and tuna., Don‚Äôt miss out on your chance to Move It! to a Browns game.

Winter weather means dryer air, more intense indoor heat and a desire for warmer baths or showers - all things that can lead to dry skin.

To protect your skin from winter wear, lower the heat in your home and use humidifiers. Take shorter baths/showers and use lukewarm water. Avoid scratchy clothes, like wool sweaters; wear softer fabrics, such as cotton. Apply moisturizers, especially after bathing. They don't add water to your skin; they prevent air from absorbing the water already in it., Give your family the gift of preventive health -- by sharing your medical history!, If you rely on pain relievers to manage joint pain, menstrual cramps and other aches, then it's important to be aware of the potential dangers of an acetaminophen overdose.

According to the FDA, research has shown that overuse of the drug ‚Äî sold under brand names such as Tylenol¬Æ, Liquiprin¬Æ and Panadol¬Æ ‚Äî can result in liver poisoning.

Taking more than 4 grams per day may result in an unintentional overdose. Since tablets typically contain 500 milligrams, most adults can safely take up to two tablets three to four times per day.

However, be extra cautious if you're taking other over-the-counter medications that contain acetaminophen, as well as consuming alcohol more than drinks per day., You get sick, you cough, and your voice gets raspy. It‚Äôs all temporary, right? But what would you do if your voice didn‚Äôt come back for years? Watch this woman‚Äôs story. http://ow.ly/8734g, Answer: C

Today, most Americans develop high blood pressure as they age. This does not occur in less-developed societies where there is less obesity, less salt in the food supply and more exercise. If we return our lifestyles to those of a simpler time, we will likely see a reduction in high blood pressure.

Quiz provided by Drs . Marc Gillinov  and Steve Nissen of the Heart & Vascular Institute and authors of Heart 411 (http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart411book.aspx)., Heart Health Quiz: If you stick to a standard American diet (too much food and too much sodium) and lifestyle (too little exercise), what are the odds that you will develop high blood pressure by the time your turn 75?
