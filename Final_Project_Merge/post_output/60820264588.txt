List(null, in 2009 I flew to Houston with every piece of clothing I owned and told my mother I wasn't coming home. I'll find my way. ambitious for an undrafted rookie that knew nothing about anything. but that's exactly what I did. this ride has had a multitude of ups and downs, but perspective is key. I've got 7 years of beautiful memories with teammates, staff and coaches I'll never forget. thank you all for being a part of this journey. people that I call friends and brothers have all contributed to the success of what we did on the field, and also to the person that I am off. with everything in me, I love and respect the men and women you are. you are a part of me for good. and to the city of houston, I genuinely appreciate every ounce of love I've ever gotten. from seeing a small kid to an 80 year old man wear my jersey. I never took it for granted. we're all just guessing our way through life, being the best people we can, and the people of this city have put a lot of joy in the hearts of my self and my family. onward we march, it's been real. nothing but love on this end. 🙏🏾, null, Health Warrior  Check out some of my favorite Super Bowl recipes., Today is #GivingTuesday.

What is your favorite dunk?, null, #TBT to last week with #SBNation, At the core of who I am is a dreamer, a man who believes in the human spirit, who believes that each of us are born with a specific gift to share, something bigger than ourselves. As an undrafted Free agent with his childhood dream shattered into pieces, I found myself at a crossroad; either pack it in and accept failure or choose to fight for my dream and be willing to die for it. I grabbed a pen and wrote this poem called, "Where We Dwell", a testament of the pain, tears, sacrifices, obstacles but also triumph and perseverance of a human spirit fighting to fulfill a dream. People will doubt you, people will ridicule you, people will say you are not good enough, you are not worthy, you do not belong. And you will make mistakes and you will fail over and over and over again but you will not surrender; you will be resilient, you will fight for your dream, you will never give up and you will succeed. And any time you feel defeated and you need a reminder of how great you are and how great you can be, go to this website, http://www.foreverwerun.com and hear my poem, "Where We Dwell". I wrote this poem for the dreamer in all of us. The light in me recognizes the light in you ! Namaste...
