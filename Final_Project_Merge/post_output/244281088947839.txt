http://www.gq.com/story/sandwiches-vs-wraps-diet-tips?mbid=social_facebook, null, Our country is facing difficult times. Difficulties with employment, with debt, and with geo-politics to name just a few. Yes, there are reasons for concern everywhere we look, yet Americans also have a reason to celebrate. A reason to rejoice. A reason to indulge. We, after all, can rely on the one factor that has never let us down. The one item that has continued to grow, to evolve, and to be a dear friend and salve to us since the days of our childhood. 

The humble sandwich, my fellow Americans, continues to reign gloriously supreme as our national "comfort food" of choice. 

THE STATE OF THE SANDWICH IS STRONG. STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE IN HISTORY. 

We are poised to experience an era of sandwich unknown by generations past. The emergence of talented specialty sandwich chefs, the ever-increasing wealth of fresh local foods, combined with the continuous development of innovative kitchen techniques will produce a sandwich landscape where quality and creativity MUST be at the forefront, or face extinction. 

The United States has spoken loudly. It yelled that the sandwich, as an institution, must be preserved and must lead the march into the next great culinary era. 

We at All Star Sandwich Bar have heard that cry and promise to carry that flag with honor. We will continue to push the limits of culinary creativity on bread; we will break down boundaries that limit taste and sustenance; we will use our passion to bring our countrymen sandwiches that they have never seen before ... and we'll do it all by having as much fun as possible, because that's the American way.
