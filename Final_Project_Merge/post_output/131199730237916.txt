It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers.” -Nelson Mandela #time2serve #MandelaDay #WisdomThruSports, Just finished a training session.

Shiesh! #kobe #motivationsunday I'm keeping track of all doubters and haters #mambamentality, Surgery prep time. Lookin like Mrs Doubtfire with a jerri curl cap lol Anesthesia next #highasakite #mambaout, This is such BS! All the training and sacrifice just flew out the window with one step that I've done millions of times! The frustration is unbearable. The anger is rage. Why the hell did this happen ?!? Makes no damn sense. Now I'm supposed to come back from this and be the same player Or better at 35?!? How in the world am I supposed to do that?? 
I have NO CLUE. Do I have the consistent will to overcome this thing? Maybe I should break out the rocking chair and reminisce on the career that         
 was. Maybe this is how my book   
ends. Maybe Father Time has defeated me...Then again maybe not! It's 3:30am, my foot feels like dead weight, my head is spinning from the pain meds and I'm wide awake. Forgive my Venting but what's the purpose of social media if I won't bring it to you Real No Image?? Feels good to vent, let it out. To feel as if THIS is the WORST thing EVER! Because After ALL the  venting, a real perspective sets in. There are far greater issues/challenges in the world then a torn achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever. 
One day, the beginning of a new career journey will commence. Today is NOT that day. 
"If you see me in a fight with a bear, prey for the bear". Ive always loved that quote. Thats "mamba mentality" we don't quit, we don't cower, we don't run. We endure and conquer. 
I know it's a long post but I'm Facebook Venting LOL. Maybe now I can actually get some sleep and be excited for surgery tomorrow. First step of a new challenge. 
Guess I will be Coach Vino the rest of this season. I have faith in my teammates. They will come thru. 
Thank you for all your prayers and support. Much Love Always.

Vanessa is now publicly active on Instagram (@LadyVB24). Be sure to follow, I may be joining soon. Enjoy the game tomorrow, it should be a good one.
Mamba Out, I don't know if any of you have family, friends or connections to the horror that took place today in Connecticut. Let us all pray for them. The devastation is immeasurable., Back spasms. I've had a hard time walking but with treatment I've been able to play. In DC now. I'm getting more treatment on my back to make sure it's ready to go for tonight.
#BeDetermined., Photos By Axis Photography/AxisPhotography.com, As you all know, I am focused on the challenge of homelessness in LA…continuing to make sure we don't forget those who need a little extra from us. There is an important film out in LA that you may want to see. I know I will see it. http://www.skidrowismyhome.com, The Blue Lights.
Just finished doing recovery session.
Getting ready to head down to Venice.
Gotta get a fresh cut first tho.
See u guys in a few.
Mamba out, When I don’t play on the court, I can be a comedian.. http://bit.ly/11OwHBw, You saw THE LIGHT last week.  Now, fans in my city get to be the first people to Strike at Light Speed.  I’ll see you on the courts at Venice Beach on Saturday afternoon.

And thank you to everyone for the kind words last night.  Appreciate the love.  Hope to see you in my city on Saturday. Until then, Mamba out., Ice bath.
Back to backs are not as easy as they used to be.
Be determined. Not discouraged., Getting ready to head to the arena. Here's the view of the arena in Houston from my hotel room.
Let's see if we can get this thing turned around starting tonight!, I watched my man Becks and the Galaxy win it all today.
Great match. Our turn now., Now you see THE LIGHT.
You're welcome., Still not feeling well, it’s a day in bed for me. Nothing like a good book to take my mind of last night’s tough loss. I'm lovin this one!, Laid up in bed.. I'm under the weather. Drinking a lot of fluids. Trying to shake the aches and chills thru rest, medicine and a lil Bob Marley on the speakers.
Big game for us tonight., Stones vs. Beatles. 
Had a hard time sleeping last night. Ankle still throbbing. Had to get up every few hours to ice it. Tried The Stones and The Beatles and I gotta say I'm into it! It has a calm aggression. Sets the tone for our game tonight in Sacramento.
Mamba out, Photos by Charlie Lopez Photography, Great day yesterday! Home walk was a huge success and I thank you all for your involvement in this great commitment to end homelessness. This is a year round battle and this issue requires a lot of patience, understanding, selflessness and persistence. From the bottom of our KVBFF hearts we thank you!!

On the Laker front we are adjusting to our new style of play fairly well. Bernie and our coaching staff have been great and extremely professional in how they have handled this coaching transition. It will be nice to have Coach D on the sidelines tonight if he's able to start.

On a social media front, I'm thinking about potentially branching out some more and want some feedback, Instagram or Twitter??? Or is there another platform I don't know about.. I will lean on your feedback.   My Facebook will remain the same. :-)

photo by: Axis Photography, Over the off season I took a walk down skid row.  It was life changing for me and I want to share those experiences with you. Please take a look and tell me what you think: http://bit.ly/T0VL51
Mamba out., It's been a wild week to say the least.
I’m happy to have closure and can't wait to get to work with Coach D'Antoni.. spacing, ball movement. And despite the chatter, I believe we will be phenomenal defensively. I’m looking forward to getting started with him and his staff this week.
Mamba out, Tough day. I've seen coaches as well as friends come and go. No matter how many years I've been playing, it's still hard to deal with. I had a good relationship with Mike and I will continue to have one. I wish him and his family nothing but the best. I spoke with him today and thanked him for all of his hard work and sacrifice.

As a team, we must focus our energy on tonight's game. We must block out the weight of today's news and simply do our jobs to the best of our ability. 

I'm not sure what direction we are heading in next. All I can do is focus on the here and now.
Mamba out, You all may remember that I am involved in United Way's HomeWalk in LA. I really appreciated your enthusiasm for my last post about it and thanks to those of you who participated last year. I want to remind you all that the walk is NEXT weekend. If you're in LA or SoCal, please sign up and join Team Kobe. My goal is that one day homelessness is nonexistent: http://homewalkla.kintera.org/teamkobe, "You have to know 400 notes that you can play, then pick the right four." - Miles Davis.

The process takes work and dedication, no matter the profession. 
Mamba out, After a tough loss last night, gotta keep moving and focus on the next one. 
Early am in Portland. Getting ankle ready after running on it for the first time in a week in a half., Feeling good enough to play tonight! I’ll use my strong midsoles for added cushion on the foot for more protection.
Looking forward to this journey as I'm sure you are.
It's Go Time.
Mamba out, Sending thoughts and prayers to everyone on the East Coast that has been impacted by Hurricane Sandy and hoping that everyone is safe., Getting stronger. Not sure what it means for tomorrow night just yet but it’s much better than it was a week ago when I could barely walk. I hate not practicing. It drives me crazy! The training staff has been great. Mr. Laker, Gary Vitti, and the great Judy Seto (the first female trainer in the NBA) have been working their magic.

I will know more after shoot around tomorrow am. It's still painful to raise up on my toes but, it’s strong. The decision to be made is whether the injury can heal while playing on it or if it will make it worse.  Either way, I'm excited about the start of the season. Hopefully we can win a game or two finally ;-)
Till tomorrow..
Mamba out, Congratulations to my partners at Panini on signing a new exclusive agreement with the NBA for trading cards and stickers through 2017!  Been with them since 2009 for all my autographs, memorabilia, and trading cards: PaniniAuthentic.com!  Happy to see that they locked the NBA up – way to start the season!

On our way to ankle therapy., Elevation, ice, and manual therapy at Lakers facility.
Gotta get right!, iVillage asked me to share my opinion on voting. I invite you to read it and share with me and the rest of the mambas why you think voting matters.

Why vote?
The idea that each vote matters and that we individually have the power to influence how we are governed is why so many of our men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.

WE MATTER.

That's a powerful feeling, one that I've taken for granted in the past. In the past I believed that not exercising my right to vote would not make a difference in who became the next president so why should I take the time to learn the issues? I'd rather be shooting hoops! The change occurred when Vanessa and I had our babies. Read More http://bit.ly/Slb3jM, Brought the fellas from LA Mission to our preseason game vs the Kings. Their stories are a true inspiration. 
We sat around and talked about their stories during my night on skid row. Amazing how resilient the human spirit can be., As some of you may know, I am the honorary chair of HomeWalk in LA. 51,000 people are homeless in Los Angeles.  This is simply unacceptable.  If you’re like me, you love L.A. and want to make it the best place to live for everyone. We can work together to end homelessness. 
 
In fact, this year, we can double our impact!  For every $100 or more you raise,  they’ll match it dollar for dollar. That’s doubling the money to help our neighbors move into homes. 
 
So, I hope that you will join my team on November 17 at HomeWalk.  http://homewalkla.kintera.org/teamkobe  
 
Sign up and I'll see you there!  
...Mamba Out, Leadership is responsibility.
There comes a point when one must make a decision. Are YOU willing to do what it takes to push the right buttons to elevate those around you? If the answer is YES, are you willing to push the right buttons even if it means being perceived as the villain? Here's where the true responsibility of being a leader lies.  Sometimes you must prioritize the success of the team ahead of how your own image is perceived.  The ability to elevate those around you is more than simply sharing the ball or making teammates feel a certain level of comfort. It's pushing them to find their inner beast, even if they end up resenting you for it at the time.

I'd rather be perceived as a winner than a good teammate. I wish they both went hand in hand all the time but that's just not reality. I have nothing in common with lazy people who blame others for their lack of success. Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses.

This is my way. It might not be right for YOU but all I can do is share my thoughts. It’s on YOU to figure out which leadership style suits you best.

Will check back in with you soon.. Till then
Mamba out, Long practices but getting a ton of work done. I had a lil tendon issue in my foot that kept me sidelined for 2 days but I'm full speed ahead once again.

Our timing with one another gets better by the day and DH is good to go on full contact. I'm tired and sore but that kind of pain feels good especially when you know what's at stake.

As far as retirement, I'm not sure how many years I have left but know this: IF and When I announce my retirement, I will do so directly to you first. Let's focus on getting this season taken care of. It should be a fun one. I feel strong, light and quick. I can't wait till Oct 31.
It's on.
Mamba out, Today Facebook welcomed its one billionth community member. In honor of that, they asked me to share what one billion meant to me: One Billion means living to learn, learning to listen, listening without judgment and judging without prejudice. One Billion. One Love., Here. We. Go.
Had a LONG first day of practice. About 5 hours. A lot of teaching and running. Nash looks in top form as always. Pau looks strong and DH is getting closer to top health each day. Metta has worked his butt off all summer and this is the best shape I have seen him in since Indiana.

As for my self, I'm just excited for this opportunity. There was a point in practice today where I looked around the court and it hit me, this is the most talent I have ever played with other then all star games and the Olympics.

We have a ton of work to do but we are hungry for that challenge.
I need to pack my body down with ice now to make sure I keep inflammation  out of my joints. It's a daily routine along with a ton of stretching. I have to stay on top of it along with the diet and weight strengthening so I don't lose all that I have gained this summer. 2 sessions tomorrow. Should be fun.

Will update you all with more intel soon.
Till then..
Mamba out, Ice bags on knees. Feet in ice water.
Standard recuperation procedure (srp) post workout., Here I am with my super-fan and his mom getting ready to take the stage of the Ellen Show. I've always been a fan of hers and I've been meaning to have a sit with her for a while :-) You can catch us on her show today., Late night jumpers at the park.., Mamba getting make up.. Can't believe I'm posting this :-), Flying Turkish Airlines tonight. I'm heading to Istanbul to shoot a Turkish Airlines spot with Mr. Leo Messi!, As you know I have a few sponsors that pay me to endorse their products. As a kid I was always skeptical of pitchmen because most of the times the campaigns never seemed genuine. So what I have tried to do throughout my career is partner with companies that share the same core competencies as I do. I've been very particular about what I post on my Facebook because this is for US. The Only Time I will post something is if I feel like it's something we ALL can share and have fun in or, if it's something that can give you access to something special or of value.
 
That leads me to the Sprite Uncontainable Game. A bunch of players from all over the world sent in videos of their best moves and I have to select the team to do battle vs Lebron’s team during the NBA All-Star Game next season. Some of the vids are good, some not so much. You can submit your video to win a spot on the team or enter to win a trip to the All-Star Game: http://bit.ly/T1ERov   
 
We are TEAM INTENSE FYI.  I’ll check back in with more info for you later.
 
Show me what you got!
Mamba out.., I think I have found my second fav sport to play!! I love it !!!!, Jr Swag with Papa Jellybean :-)
My sis sent me this pic.. Thought you might get a kick out of it., My family foundation supports a local organization who is fighting homelessness called My Friends Place. You can join me in learning about homelessness and fighting for others too: http://kvbff.org, My family philanthropy supports a local organization who is fighting homelessness called My Friends Place.  I first went there a year ago to begin my journey.  Last night, to better understand the issue, I spent a night learning more about homelessness at the LA Mission from those who have been affected first hand. 

The number one message I carry from them is that of love, compassion and faith. With "great power comes great responsibility". We all have the POWER to affect change in the lives of others. To live life with our heads under water afraid to see the swells crashing above us, is not LIVING. Living is inspiring others to live. Living is helping others find their way. Living is spotlighting those who have been sleeping in dark corners for so long that society has become blind to their invisibility.

LA MISSION IS LIVING!!

Thank you LA Mission for Welcoming me into your home. I learned a ton and am looking forward to learning more and helping you in the fight to end homelessness.

Fans, you can join me in learning and fighting for others too: http://kvbff.org.
 
God Bless
Mamba out.., Jillian Michaels my Stand Up To Cancer desk neighbor :-) Call 1-888- 907-8263, Getting ready for the big Stand Up To Cancer night with the gold medal champ Gabby! Don't forget to phone in. I might answer your call: 1-888-907-8263.  
The show is on all major networks starting at 8/7c.
STAND UP 2 CANCER, I Love the game of basketball. It's my passion. As I have matured over the years, I have come to appreciate the game even more. The positive impact I and many others can have on lives thru championing great causes is what has elevated the temperature of my passion even more. Tomorrow I will be "manning the desk" -- answering phones and taking contributions--for STAND UP TO CANCER. The phone bank will open at 4:30 pm Friday and I will share the number with you when I get it.

It's nearly impossible to live in today's world and not know someone directly or indirectly who has been impacted by Cancer. I will be there with many other people who are passionate about what they do. They are all beasts in their respective fields. We will all be working the phones as a team for this great cause. 

I would love to hear from you! Be it one dollar or five, every contribution counts. WE can make a huge impact tomorrow so I'm calling on all my fellow mambas to pick up the phone and represent.

Till then mamba out!, Ziplining! You know I can't just sit down and sunbathe. Gotta stay active :-), So official., A handwritten note from Rudy., Have any of you seen the film "Rudy"?
I first saw it when I was 15 or 16. The story gave me the biggest jolt of inspiration of any film I have ever seen. 

If Rudy could accomplish that without being blessed with the physical talent to play football at that level, then what could I accomplish if I worked as hard as he did? After watching that movie, I decided that I would always work as if I'm the last man on the team that had everything to prove. From that point to this day I have been doing exactly that. 

I met the real Rudy by chance last season on the court prior to a road game vs Sacramento. His daughter just so happen to be singing the national anthem that night. He had no clue what an inspiration he has been for me over the years. It was great to finally meet him and share with him what a great influence his story has had on me. 

This morning I received a copy of his book. It dives even deeper into his journey. I share this with you in hopes that it might ignite in you a similar passion as it did for me. It doesn't matter if you play sports or not. Determination, belief, perseverance, passion etc.. Will elevate you to your goal no matter what the goal may be. 

Mamba out., Beach bummin today just like I said I would.. R & R :-), View of the Santa Monica Pier from the "mamba chopper", Thank you for all the Facebook luv. As most of you know, I have always been terrified about doing anything digital, but I really enjoy posting and reading the responses. It inspires me and I think we can all learn from one another on a wide range of topics. More posts coming.. This season should be an interesting one and I'd love to keep you up to date on the real..
Much luv, Mamba., I will blindly whoop your ass...check this out!!, I recently had a discussion with my business team that I would like to share with you. It started with a simple question and turned into an entire debate about what drives us, why and where does the "hunger" come from. Are you born with THAT ambition or does it evolve from life's experiences, maybe it's both? 

Here's the question: If you walked into a gym and there were 10 elite athletes lined up, all of them the same height, same weight and physical build, would you be able to determine who the best is and who is going to BECOME the best??, Where are my chocolate pancakes and scrambled eggs with cheese + side of bacon and a soda? Oh, that's right.. I'm 34, not 24!!
LOL, I'm 34!! Wow how time flies :-) 
Thank you for all of the birthday wishes!!, Talking healthy habits with the First Lady., Finally home!!  I Love L.A.

It's been a long yet short summer. I'm gonna try to enjoy what's left of it as much as possible. My oldest wants to learn how to surf so it looks like the beach it is for me.  Don't worry Lakerland, I'm not hopping on a board any time soon -- just supervising :-) I'm going to enjoy this time of rest as much as possible while still focusing on not losing what I've gained from all of my training thus far.

Here's my late night work session pic with my partner in crime, Cesar.  He's a Sable German Shepherd from Germany. It's good to have my training partner back, LOL

Holla at you soon..
Mamba out, The Sprite China 2nd Annual Charity Basketball game was a ton of fun. We played two 15 min halves with a running clock. I watched from the bench for the first half. We were trailing by 9 when I was notified that fans via text can choose a team to add 20 additional points to their tally!!! We were now down 29!! I wanted to play it cool but what the heck, the place was packed with fans who’d sang an early happy birthday to me and really wanted to watch me go to work. My teammates were down. They are all singers/actors and do not play ball much AT ALL, but they are very successful at what they do hence they are VERY competitive. They asked if I could bring them back in the second half.. 

I didn't want to disappoint them or the fans that had paid their hard earned money for a show so I took the challenge of really using the second half as a training session for my stamina. I ran and ran and ran. I wound up scoring 68 in the 2nd and we won. Like I said, they are not basketball players by any stretch of the imagination. I was just having fun with all of them and loved hearing the crowd enjoy the show we put on.
 
They performed some of their number 1 hits. We took pics and signed autographs. I believe we raised 2.6MM RMB for underprivileged youth here in China! That is the MOST important number of the night. Sprite, one of my sponsors, hosted the game. They carry a great message of self-expression: Don't be afraid to be who you are -- by doing, so that you will find your own path and your own greatness as you define it. 

Here’s my pic with Jay Chou. For those who might not know he is a HUGE star in China and we have done several China based commercials and events together. He is THE beast of his field. 

Tomorrow is my last day in China then it's back home for some much needed rest :-)

Much love. Mamba., My view: Shanghai lights!, Missed the Amazing Allstars this year, but wanted to share it with you…

http://www.la-allstars.org/index.php/component/content/article/38-rokstories-frontpage/335-china-educational-tour-2012, The Love in Jinan has been awesome! Heading to Wuhan. I need some sleep! LOL, Can’t believe the games are over, seems like yesterday we were walking into the stadium with nerves of excitement and dreams of Gold. The dust has settled, the medals handed out. Some have fulfilled their dreams, and others have come up short. The true beauty of the Olympics, however, is happening now and will continue up until opening ceremonies in Rio 2016. The beauty I'm referring to is the beauty of determination, grit, will, work, pain, sacrifice, etc.. For those who came up short in these games, what will they change to get on top in Rio? For those who won Gold, what will they use to keep their motivation up to repeat as the world’s best?

Think about it! All over the world athletes are training.  Someone, somewhere, while no one is watching, no TVs, no flags, no fanfare,  is going to push a little harder and train a little smarter and that's going to be the difference and what separates them from the pack.

Do you think there is a kid somewhere out there ambitious enough to want to take down Phelps’ medal count? As you look back on the games and think towards Rio don't forget to follow some of the athletes and their stories. You never know, you may find a Bolt before the rest of the world does..

Much love and respect to all the athletes. This was my last Olympics. I enjoyed it to the fullest.

Train for Gold NOW!!! Best of luck to you all.

Mamba out, Olympics credential :-), Battle of the unibrow!!! Who wins???, Per game plan!

USA

Just Do It

Win The Gold!!, GOLD!!!, I had a chance to sit down with Laura Okmin of Fox Sports to talk about more than just Gold!, Congratulations to our US women’s soccer team for taking the gold in a rematch vs Japan. It was very inspirational to see the excitement and tears of joy from them as they won gold. Their semifinal match vs Canada was a classic. They had to dig deep and find "it" and that's exactly what they did. The ability to look inside yourself and find that inner switch is what makes sports such a teacher of life. 
________________________________________________________

Congratulations to our US women's bball squad. Their dominance over the sport is unlike any other. I was fortunate to attend a practice of theirs and witnessed what makes coach Geno so great and why his success is no accident: His ability to clearly communicate and the detail of his teachings. Much respect to the team! They represented with great class and are a great example of playing the game at its highest level. It was a joy to be in the stands and watch them win gold..
________________________________________________________

Our turn now! 
I think back to the opening ceremony pic with mi hermano Pau and the smiles on our faces knowing that at the end of the day we would have to face off. Well that time has now come… I hope you’re ready my brother. 
GO U.S.A., We did a great job against Argentina. Now we face our nemesis in Spain for the Gold. We’re excited for tomorrow!, Well, it looks like Superman has found a home. I wish nothing but the best for Big Bynum. I hope he follows what was a great season last year with an even better one next year. I know LA is excited about the deal and rightfully so. The Lakers landed a piece that will hopefully carry the franchise long after I'm gone. I have spoken to Dwight Howard already and we are locked and loaded to bring back the title. Wow, what a summer Jimmy and Mitch have had so far. Unreal! I'm focused on our semifinal game vs Argentina but I had to pause for a few to send you my thoughts, in case you were curious.., What can I say, the mamba came out last night. I was able to find a rhythm from anger. I was frustrated by the first half and no calls. I allowed myself to get frustrated and I tried to turn it into something I could use as energy to fuel my performance. It worked out.
On our way to watch our U.S women soccer team compete for the Gold!
Congrats to the USA Women Basketball team for their semifinal win over Australia.
It’s crazy how the Olympics are almost over. Time flies. It’s important to savor every moment and live.
Be sure to tune in to the soccer match tonight vs Japan. Should be a great one!
Mamba out., We got past a real tough and physical team Australia yesterday.  Tomorrow we take on Argentina again., Serena Williams: Different animal, same Beast! 
You're welcome., There’s been a lot of great and competitive basketball so far! Check out the results from our game against Argentina., On the train after a big win vs Argentina. Crew deep!, Congratulations to pole vaulter Jenn Suhr and her coach and husband Rick. GOLD!, The fellas giving the starting blocks a try lol. We def won't quit our day jobs!!, Kevin Love took this pic of me and Harden in the starting blocks., Bolt right after his Olympic record setting run., Get up to date on our latest game vs. Lithuania!, Tough game vs a very well balanced and coached team from Lithuania. They executed their game plan perfectly. Slow the game down, create a lot of foul situations and spread the floor with timely shooting. We responded to the challenge by creating a lot of turnovers and getting out on the break. We felt we had a mismatch with LBJ being defended by their 4 man, so we gave him the ball and told him to attack. That's exactly what he did and we came away with a gritty W. We should have another fun one vs Argentina next :) Can't wait.

After the game I took my family to see Michael Phelps' last swim. We witnessed 2 world records + 1 olympic record. Ranomi Kromowidjojo set an OR in the women's 50 free, while Sun Yang set a new men's 1500 free WR lowering his time by more than 3 seconds. Both amazing performances! Our U.S women dominated the medley relay with a WR performance of their own. Then it was on to Phelps and the U.S men's medley relay. The place was packed and cameras were flashing. We were there to support Michael but also because it's important for my kids to see the results of hard work. It's one thing to hear it from "Dad" but another to see others enjoy the success of hard work.
It was a long day but a good one. Usain Bolt and the 100 are on our menu next!
Till then.., I witnessed the longest match in Olympic history today-- Federer vs. Del Potro. It was great shot after great shot.  Federer kept his composure the entire match, never appearing rattled. Del Potro didn't give one inch. The match lasted almost 5 hours until Roger was finally able to break Del Potro and finish the match., All I can say is everything clicked tonight. Our defense was sharp, our hands were active, our feet were lively, and our shooting was accurate. We are all explosive individually so when we find that groove as individuals all at the same time in the same game, LOOK OUT.  I have to stay focused though. The next game is against Lithuania and we can't afford a letdown. We have to keep pushing and hopefully keep the rhythm we've been on the last few games. Two more games left then we’re on to the medal rounds! We must stay sharp.

Congrats to Gabby on her gymnastics individual Gold and to our women's 8 seat rowing team for back to back Olympic Gold performances!!

I hope you guys are keeping up with all the other sports. You can learn so much about basketball thru the skills of others. Phil Jackson once told me that he always looked for players who played a myriad of sports because they learn a multitude of skills that are necessary to understand the game of basketball at a higher level. So, I encourage everyone to not be narrow minded but to instead look at other sports thru the lens of your own and you will learn from others how to better yourself.

Mamba out., Rebecca Soni just broke her own world record-- once in the semis and just tonight in the finals. She is a badass!!!, Pre-Game meal and women's individual gymnastics final., Now, if we can get back to Sergey Bubka who I mentioned yesterday. The fact that he broke his own record 35 times demands more attention. Not for the accomplishment but more for trying to figure out where in the world he was pulling his motivation from?
Where do you pull your motivation from? What drives you? What do you think or feel that makes you continue on when you feel like quitting?, I'd be out of the loop if I didn't give big props to our women's gymnastics squad. They ran away with the GOLD and made it look easy. For the life of me I cannot figure out how in the world they walk, jump and back flip on the balance beam. Just watching them do it scares the crap out of me. I could only imagine if that was one of my daughters up there! Congrats ladies! I am looking forward to cheering you on in the stands during the individual competitions., I was part of a panel today that included Coach K and Sergey Bubka, who still holds the outdoor/indoor world records in pole vaulting. We sat on a stage and fielded questions from Olympic coaches who wanted to learn more about maximizing an athlete’s potential. I learned quite a bit from the answers of the panel members. Sergey in particular talked about never being satisfied. How every day is a new day. This is a man who broke his own record 35 times!!! He talked about his hunger to want to do more; to learn more and to be more. Very inspirational., Get up to date on our latest game vs. Tunisia!, Great win for us tonight! Much respect to Tunisia they played hard and competed. As a team we are hungry for the next game already. I enjoy being around these young fellas. They have great energy and it gives me even more motivation to keep up ;-)

What about Michael Phelps! 19 medals. 15 Golds. The amount of focus is beyond understanding. We should all embrace his Olympic Era because we truly have been witnessing history in the making.

It’s a day off for us tomorrow so I will be attending more Olympic competition. Not sure which ones I will make it to yet but looking forward to being a fan again., Taking on Tunisia today. USA!, So yesterday I decided to go see our U.S ladies play volleyball. They are the #1 team in the world. Before we both left for London, I was invited by their coaching staff to stop by their training camp and say a few words to the team. The hot topics were leadership, preparation, recovery, focus and playing with the pressure of being the #1 team. I could feel their energy in the room. They had a drive that only comes from having a goal and BELIEVING to your core that the goal belongs to you and no one else. The game was a great one! There were a lot of digs and kills and amazing set ups and passion. They played the game without the weight that comes from the fear of failure. Instead, they played with a hunger that can carry a match. They beat a very tough Brazilian team yesterday—a team that could very possibly be an obstacle down the road. But for now, the win belongs to US :) Congrats ladies. Rest up and keep Rollin!, Check out what happened in our Olympic opener against France!, I'm pleased about our performance today. We did commit too many fouls the first quarter which slowed the game down. Once we got use to the officiating we were able to play foul free and speed France up. We are at our best in transition. All in all we are excited to finally get the real show started! We’re rolling forward to the next game vs Tunisia. This photo is taken inside of my room. I love looking at our flag in this environment. It reminds me of the men and women who serve our country and all of the sacrifices they and their families make and have made to ensure the freedoms we enjoy.
Much Love., I talk about the Kobe System being in full effect in London, and the message I had for my Lakers teammate Pau Gasol before the Olympic games started., Well, today we get it on! USA!, Represent!, My photo diary on MSN/FS. Make sure to read the story about meeting Jenn Suhr., Here’s a link to the schedule of events. I’m still working out what other events I am going to try and see. What are you following in the Olympics other than basketball?, Proud of mi hermano Pau. Being the flag bearer for your country is beyond an honor. This is us at the opening ceremony as we get set for our march toward the stadium and toward a possible showdown for the GOLD., Me and Tyson Gay, one of the fastest men in the world. He’s a sprint beast who's competing in the 100m and 4x100m Relay., Me and Jason Lezak, the 4x100m relay master who helped his team bring home the gold in Beijing., Me and Rebecca Soni, ranked the best breaststroke swimmer in the world. She’s competing in four events: Women's 4x200m Freestyle Relay, Women's 100m Breaststroke, Women's 200m Breaststroke, and Women's 4x100m Medley Relay., Find out why I feel like a kid in a candy store at the Olympics. I'm also asked if I have ever trained with U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps., I thought it might be good to share a little piece I found online about training the mind so the body can perform at its highest potential, even in the most pressure packed environment. We all have to perform under "pressure" and we’re expected to deliver results. MY approach is to view the moment as a great opportunity by visualizing the results I'm looking for and then being able to "let go" and allow all of the training to flow out of me. Everyone deals with "pressure" in different ways. I'm curious to know how you deal with it. Do you meditate? Do you visualize? Do you just try to ignore it? Do you cave to it and want to learn how not to? Let's spend some time commenting on this and see how much we can learn from each other about the best way to deal with the mental game., Picking up all of our USA ceremony gear. All rivalries are put on hold to represent our country!, I talk about building chemistry with my Olympic teammates, what Team USA practices are like, and I also explain the reasoning for my new goatee! Check it out below., U.S. Women Soccer team defeats France 4-2!
I watched a match that was won by togetherness and competitive spirit. Being down 2-0 while being the favorites puts an enormous amount of pressure on a team. The pressure can cause weaker teams to divide and start to cast blame and point fingers. Our Women’s National Team instead responded to the challenge and got tough. I want to hear from soccer aficionados out there, what did you all think of the performance?, Off day in Barcelona. Probably our last off day for a while lol. Big game today for our U.S. women's soccer team. They take on France in their first match of the games. I have a flat screen all set up and will be supporting Alex, Hope, Abby and our women as they begin their quest for gold. Show your love and support as well, if u don't know anything about soccer then it's about time you learned. Beautiful game and our woman are ranked 1 in the world. Time to get with it. U.S.A., I just so happen to be staying in the same hotel with the Australian swim team. I couldn't resist the chance to watch them train and prepare for the Olympics, so I asked if it would be ok. They were excited to have me there. I loved the attention to detail they put into their training and the methodical approach they have. I was lucky because on this am Stephanie Rice , 3 time gold medal winner in Beijing and the best women's swimmer in the world was training. I had the chance to see the best in the world prepare and she is FOCUSED. I took pics with the swimmers and they gave me some speedos lol. The Olympics for me is a great chance to learn from the worlds best and figure out what makes them tick all while representing your country. What a great opportunity and honor., Check out this interview of some of our KBA campers., When I first started as a Laker, I said I wouldn't be in the league when I'm 35.
