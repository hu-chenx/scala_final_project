Just to update you all, there was a fire that originated in the building outside of Flat Top Johnny's space. The fire and smoke spread through some duct work that runs through FTJ. The ducts were fire-rated and did their job containing the flames. 

Unfortunately FTJ suffered extensive water and smoke damage and will need major repairs. As we speak the carpets are being removed and the clean up has begun. We will be diligently working over the next few weeks to bring back your favorite local pool hall.

Here's a tip from our friends at The United States Professional Poolplayers Association (UPA): 

"Keeping an eye on your opponent's shots is just as important as analyzing your own. A ball in hand foul in your favor is a gem in pool, and it is your responsibility to call it. Watching every one of your opponents shots also helps you pinpoint his/her weaknesses, which can give you the insight for playing that perfect Safe."

It is indeed a spirited day and people from all over the world come to share it with us. The spirit of Monday's Patriots' Day will not be taken from us by two twisted individuals. A day of solemn remembrance today, but on Monday we will gather again and move forward., Pool is one of the safest sports in the world.

Or three.

RESCUE ONE K√ñLSCH Watch City Brewing‚Äôs German-style Golden Ale. This light offering is brewed with premium German Malt, noble hops and yeast. The fermentation is done on the colder side of ale fermentation temperatures (61‚Äì65 F) and lagered for weeks in cold conditioning to produce a clean, crisp, delicately balanced beer usually with very subtle fruit flavors and aromas. Subdued maltiness throughout leads to a pleasantly refreshing tang in the finish. 

Smooth and crisp in the taste. 

Four, but that's it!

Flat Top Johnny‚Äôs 20th Anniversary Beer!

Yes, you read that correctly. 

20 years of kickass billiards and great drinks!

It was October, 1993 when John Adams ‚Äì bartender extraordinaire at Cambridge Brewing since 1990 ‚Äì left CBC to go it on his own.

One barbershop haircut and twelve red-felted tournament tables later, and Flat Top Johnny‚Äôs was born. 

Flat Top‚Äôs quickly gained a reputation as a great pool room with a hip vibe, which it has maintained ever since, without letting numerous awards and accolades go to their heads.

So we felt compelled to brew a beer in their honor ‚Äì 
it‚Äôs what we do, after all.

See you Saturday for the party!! 
RSVP ---> http://is.gd/ftjcbc, The 20th Anniversary pint glasses are in!
