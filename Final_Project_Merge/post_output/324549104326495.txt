List(The #Teriyaki Burrito. 19 years, 1 month, 6 days and 5 hours old... and counting., Aracelly... It was 13 years ago this week that Boloco caught a break and you joined our team. Sometime during this coming year I estimate you will surpass your 1 millionth burrito rolled. Which more importantly means 1 million more smiling faces thanks to yours. 😀👍🙏🏼, Average wage @boloco for the last 2 weeks was $13.48 per hour not including value of benefits (health, dental, sick, vaca, etc.) #progress #raisethewage #evenaburritoaspires, Boloco Friends and Family,

Two corporate "CYA" things to note in response to a hundred and one questions - and a few phone calls - about our FREE SAINT PADDY'S DAY GUAC PROMO BELOW...

1) Yes, you need to buy something to get your free delicious Guac today... we will run out if you try to skip Whole Foods and stock your fridge with our Guac instead. Besides, it's bad karma to try that anyway...

2) Our online/app partners just let us know that they can't "turn on" Free Guac after all so we are stuck with this promo being in-store with a cashier only. Not cool at all. The "what gives?! it's 2016!" argument we try to use in moments like these works about as well as it did in 1997...  

If you have any issues, reach us at hello@boloco.com and we'll take care of your concerns... no questions asked, as always.

Click below for the actual details.

OK - Happy St. Patrick's Day!, It would be so cool if you could add our scratch-made Guac to your burrito for free for St. Patty's Day, you know? #green, $5 to go till I get my next Boloco reward... how about you?

Today only!, #TBT 4 years ago when those thugs robbed @bolocoberklee and BPD Detective Joe Leeman cracked the case and won 2012 #detectiveoftheyear http://bit.ly/bolocorobbery, #BeLikeMatt, Friends and Foes... Boloco is New England. We were born here, we live here, we love it here. It's unlike us to bring up our competitors, but we're breaking the silence now. Too much is on the line. If not now, when?!

Here's the deal. Teams Chipotle 🌯 and Qdoba 🌯. The big guys that invaded our home during the last decade. You know where they call home? That's right. Denver. They are praying that our Patriots go down in Mile High on Sunday. So whether you like their burritos better than ours or not, we New Englanders must stick together these next 24 hours if we hope to beat the Broncos.

So let's do stick together then, ok? It will matter. Yeah, we're superstitious at Boloco, that's right. But a burrito from Chip-Doba is a vote cast for the Broncos. And a burrito from Boloco (which #12 has been eating since he started in the NFL, for criminy sakes 😮) or even our friends at Anna's 🌯 (super steak anyone?!) is a little karmic energy for Brady and the Pats. In 24 hours from now we will all be celebrating a big win together and getting ready for Super Bowl 50.

Got something to say? Say it. Let's do this. #patriots #sticktogether #eatBoloco #eatBolocoagain #eatAnnastoo #beatdenver, Look friends... Boloco is New England, like it or not. We were born here, we live here, we love it here. It's unlike us to bring up our competitors, but we're breaking the silence now. If not now, when?! Here's the deal... Teams Chipotle and Qdoba are based in Denver and whether you like their burritos better than ours or not, we New Englanders must stick together these next few days. See that burrito Brady is reaching for the winning TD against Denver?  Yup. You guessed it. That's a super-sized Boloco burrito... and although he won't admit it its likely a Buffalo Steak Burrito he'll give to Giselle after the game. It's true. Like it or not.  So, let's do this now, ok??  Let's stick together. In 48 hours from now we will all be celebrating a big win together and getting ready for Super Bowl 50. #patriots #sticktogether #eatBoloco #eatBolocoagain #beatdenver, null, Patriots, MLK, Snow, Good Karma...

Boloco on School Street closed for good today.  It was a solid 6.5 years. Thanks to so many of you who visited us day in and day out since March of 2009.  We opened in the depths of the Great Recession with a massive whole in the ground a block away.  That hole is now gone and so is the recession, but for many reasons it was time for us to allow another concept to take our place.  Hopefully we will see many of you at nearby Congress Street, Federal Street, and Boston Common locations. And yes, most of our School Street team have been redeployed to other restaurants in the Boloco family. Thank you again. Your friends at Boloco, Boloco. Fall. Pumpkin Shake.

our last day will be this coming Monday, June 22nd, and we hope you will come to see us this weekend... and we hope to see you soon at our nearest locations at boloco Copley and boloco Berklee, just 3,495 original burritos walking distance away (...or .4 miles, take your pick!)., a picture is worth a thousand words. two of those are cheeseburger burrito. #burritoproverbs, submit your best boloco pics to be featured as our cover photo!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1OpP04jE4A, meet our beloved Aracelly, from our Boston Common location. when we asked her what inspires boloco, this is what she said. #thisisboloco, remember our April Fools’ joke a few weeks ago, when we renamed ourselves The Wrap? it made us ask ourselves a few questions. what’s in a name, anyway? how do you define boloco? what do we stand for? where are we from? what exactly are we inspired by? and what keeps guests and team members coming back to boloco? 

there’s one thing we can agree on though. whatever way you put it, we’re a local company, with globally inspired food. #thisisboloco

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lKPUTiF0Rg, how do you define boloco? whatever way you put it, we’re a local company, with globally inspired food :) #thisisboloco, we just finished reading all of the responses to our guest survey. to those of you who took a few minutes to answer our questions and give us your thoughts, thank you! thank you for the suggestions, constructive criticism, and tough love. and, thank you for the memes, raps, and poems. we knew you all were creative, but you always surprise us :) we want to share two of our favorites:

 *beat starts* IM ABOUTA BREAK IT DOWN Burritos are awesome They are really great And when I eat them I know it's fate But not any burrito Only at Boloco They are so neato They make me go loco The milkshakes are amazing And all day I'm grazing On the burritos from my favorite place Guess what it's Boloco because it's so ace (Freestyle)

Definition of bo: 1. an exclamation uttered to startle or surprise someone, 2. an exclamation of encouragement or an expression of enthusiasm Loco: Crazy :) boloco!!, it's the Boston Red Sox home opener! tell us your prediction for the score at the 7th inning stretch - win free burritos :) #bolocopeningday, null, excited for the Boston Red Sox home opener? stay tuned for Monday, we think baseball and burritos are a home run ;)  #bolocopeningday #puns, submit your best boloco pics to be featured as our cover photo!

i: @bolocogram, after 10 years as boloco, we have come to terms with the fact that our name isn’t working. we have always prided ourselves on being 100% honest, so we’re going to own it: our name is confusing at best and disingenuous at worst. as of today, 4/1, we will return to our former name, The Wrap. as part of this process, we are also dramatically cutting back our menu, to six menu items that were on the original menu from The Wrap. 

for all of the details on our rebranding, please read our official statement (http://conta.cc/1GL17JU), check out our new menu, and be sure to read the fine print…. ;), null, if you've been to boloco in the last 11 years, you probably have met Matty T. and if you haven't met him yet.. well, you should :) #tastytastygoodness, don't let summer pass you by. this weekend is your last chance to buy a summer burrito or bowl and get a mini mango passion smoothie for $1. plus, we'll donate 10 cents to the Boston Harbor Island Alliance for every summer sold :), submit your best boloco pics to be featured as our cover photo!

 On Wednesday, we lost hot water at the restaurant. We closed immediately on our own. You may have seen on social media that the restaurant received a health violation. We want to be clear that this was a direct result from the hot water issue and that no guests were served while we were addressing the lack of hot water. 

We were cleared by the City of Boston’s Division of Health Inspections to re-open on Thursday, but we continued to have problems with hot water. We closed on our own again this afternoon, took further steps to fix the hot water issue, and re-opened this evening. 

To make sure we are making the best, safest burritos, bowls, smoothies, and shakes for you, our Children’s location team members went through a ServSafe refresh class Wednesday evening. 

We know that our unexpected closures disappointed and confused you and we know that you will have concerns about health and safety. If you have any questions, give us a shout at buzz@boloco.com.

Want your picture to be featured as our cover photo? Post it on our Facebook wall, tweet it to us, or mention @bolocogram or #boloco on instagram!, TRUE STORY - "Loud Voices, 1.5x Holiday Pay , and 10 Extra Boloco Card Points"  

A few years ago, we learned from some of our more vocal team members during one of our "Leadership Retreats" that if they were asked (or just chose) to work on a holiday, they should get paid extra.  Makes sense, right?!  Well, yes, but as many reading this know, not always so easy for small businesses to accomodate.

In the end, about 90 team members then voted (along with all of the GMs in the company) that on the 6 annual holidays in which Boloco chose to be open, all hourly team members working on those days would be paid 1.5x their normal pay.  July 4th is one of those holidays, and today is July 4th.  Other ideas on the table ranged from transportation discounts (voted in a few months later), childcare benefits, and many others.

Please consider visiting our open restaurants today and saying hi to our team members who chose to work today, and for those of you who buy something and swipe their registered Boloco Card, you will receive an extra 10 points*.

Happy July 4th Everyone!

*All Extra Points will be loaded onto qualified cards no later than July 9, 2013

This is real footage from our security cameras, but we've added some music and our own commentary, just because why not (right?), and we're hoping it'll lead to finding this person. 

Like last year, when something similar happened at Boloco Berklee, we know you might find it odd that we're sharing this, but we think everyone needs to see what is happening out there, and work together to reduce and one day eliminate evil people like this guy. 

Oh, also, a certain Boston Detective who was assigned the Berklee case won 2012 detective of the year for cracking the case and nabbing a gang of pros.  No reason it can't happen in Bethesda too ;)

For that reason, we share it with you in the event you would like to comment, jump on the bandwagon, make some counterpoints, or generally just be human and opine from the safety of your laptop or Blackberry Z10... and in the end, it's all supposed to be just fun, so please keep it light... we're just a burrito joint after all ;-)

Ok, let's do it!

----------------------------------

Boloco,

I'm going to put this plainly. Why is it that every email you send out is inept and brand-damaging? The hurricane opening, the snow storm opening, the ridiculous new Byzantine reward point structure, and now this unfunny (and late) April Fools missive?

The point as I understand it of a marketing email is to promote sales and give another dimension to the company, to inform your loyal supporters and maybe make them laugh. All of which is in the service of having them come
back and tell other people about Boloco. 

What are your customers supposed to take away from these messages? They make you seem disorganized, wrong-headed, and frankly passive-aggressive.

Shape up!, After a long deliberation, we're proud to introduce the winners of our Sweet 16th birthday contest.

Congratulations to all 16 of you! And thanks to everyone who submitted - we enjoyed reading through ALL your words of wisdom (SO much that it took us a while...!), and will definitely take them to heart :-), In about 10 minutes, one talented burrito therapist will receive an email that looks like this..., MOO!

His name is Carlos. He runs Newbury Street. He demands that we not make him shut down. And yet the hate mail floods in as people call us greedy, not nice, evil.

We took down an anonymous person's FB post that was calling out, um, mice in our harvard restaurant.  While we take the feedback itself very seriously and will hunt down and smoke out any non-human forms of life as we do aggressively every day anyway, the post itself was clearly with malicious intent and the user profile was created just for this purpose.  So, something tells me we'll get heat for this (both for the alleged mice and taking down the post), but wanted to be open about it anyway, at our own risk.  I don't think we've ever removed a post prior to this, hopefully never feel a need to again.  But if we do feel a need to make true evilness disappear, we'll paraphrase that feedback just as we have done here.

Thanks, and as always, happy to hear feedback - the good, bad and ugly - from real people ;)

For Boloco, union members are not only our valued customers, but have literally helped build our business as we've expanded across Boston, using predominantly union labor. 

Sadly, a couple of labor organizations have taken to protesting our and other Boston retail businesses over a particular disagreement for a number of years--often with signs and statements that are inflammatory, untrue, and have nothing to do with their complaint itself. And yes, their actions have been very harmful to our and other small businesses in Boston.

My reference to "union rackets" in my tweet was to that situatuion in particular, and I in no way meant to criticize the labor movement or "unions" generally, or union members, who are such an important part of our community. 

I should have chosen my words more carefully. Unions had nothing to do with the incident reported in the Globe. While damage has been done (we will respond to each and everyone of you who have voiced concern and more) I sincerely do apologize for this.

"Elements - Water"
(a poem)

Water an elemental
Water a fundamental
Building block of 
life
Water of Life
Water of Death

Water in all religions
Water
 in all living things
Water in all countries
Water also used for 
barter

No life without water
No rife with water
No respect 
for water
Willful neglect of water

Water, for cooking
Water,
 for cleaning
Water, for drinking
Water, for living
Water, for 
dying

Water is the same
In all languages
Water is the same
To
 all living beings

@b_good_ replacing @boloco on mass ave in early march, Ragin' Cajuns and Mini Mangoes (for a buck - see link)... and announcing Burlington VT's Free Burrito Day on 2/27 - the first of many celebrating our 13th anniversary, Double Points on your Boloco Card for the rest of the day..., SNOLOCO CHALLENGE RESULTS REVISITED... as rumors of another approaching snow storm in New England swirl, some of you may be happy to know that we at Boloco made an error in your favor related to last week's snoloco challenge. 

Here are the boring details... the 5,715 guests we served last Wednesday only accounted for 14 of our 16 restaurants... the real number served in all 16 restaurants was 6,257 (handily surpassing the necessary 6,058 figure to earn 13th Anniversary Free Burrito Day).  Even though the 6,058 figure SHOULD actually have been 6,661 (that was an error too), since we publicly posted 6,058 as the number to beat, we will now make good on our promise.  

What does this all mean?  Yes... you guessed it... a series of Free Burrito Days are soon to follow!  Stay tuned for our upcoming email announcing dates and times and locations (sign up on link below - scroll to "mail call" on bottom right... and take our expansion city poll while you are at it plz)

Last week was huge... seriously, declarations of snow emergencies were all but ignored by thousands of you.  But celebrating 13 years with Free Burrito Days will be even bigger... thanks for keeping us on our toes and making our jobs so interesting and exciting :), FINAL UPDATE:  5,715 (vs. 6,058 last year).  We missed (yup, even with the 200 bonus points).  The last 2 hours were incredibly slow.  Regardless, it was an unbelievable effort and one that won't go unrewarded (149 thumbs up have to be worth something!).  We're not known to disappoint when it comes to these events, and we're not going to start now.  Stay tuned for something substantial in the next week or two... and in the meantime, enjoy redeeming your receipts tomorrow and Friday!, UPDATE as of 10:00PM:  5,658 (vs. 5960 last year)... not including the amazing 200 bonus points... final update soon to follow..., UPDATE as of 7:00PM:  no specific update, except that we're falling behind.  If 100 people can give a thumbs up to this note (never done in the history of Boloco facebook posts), we'll add 200 burritos to the tally versus last year.  It's going to be close.  

Need inspiration to push through these last 2 hours (or to give a thumbs up)??  Just watch link below... last 2 quarters, last 2 hours... let's make it happen ;), UPDATE as of 6:00PM:  5,150 (versus 5,311 last year)... less than 15 visits per each of the 13 Bolocos that are still open stand in the way of an all-New England Free Burrito Day (a pittance on most days).  That said, we're feeling pretty safe right this moment... while it would cost us dearly, we'd love to see a comeback... sadly, the dramatic headlines of the last few days and the declared snow emergencies seem to have worked.  The streets of Boston are barren.  It's up to the NH and VT restaurants... root for our northern friends to get us across the finish line!, UPDATE as of 4:00PM:  4,573 (versus 4,623 last year), UPDATE as of 3:00PM:  4,228 customers (versus 4,234 same time last year)..., UPDATE:  as of 2:00PM, counting School Street (which was not open 1 year ago), we have stuffed 3,711 of you versus 3,682 as of 2PM on the same day last year.  The snow is actually falling now (versus 58 and SUNNY last year)... so it gets tougher from here, but we're tracking ahead of 6,058 for the day and for now that's all that counts!, UPDATE:  as of 1:00PM, 2,386 guests had put themselves at great personal risk to help us reach our target of 6,059 guests today and unlock a Free Burrito Day bonanza later this month., UPDATE: as of 12:00 NOON, 971 guests had braved this monster of a storm and shelled out some dineros at boloco.

Always the big question we are asked... what makes Boloco different/unique? why should a place like boloco feel like it deserves to continue growing?  Keep in mind who we compete with, and who people think we compete
with.  Think about what it takes for a little guy like us to take on
the 800LB gorilla(s).  Feedback that's most helpful addresses those
important perspectives... tell us something we don't know about ourselves (it happens, a lot)... and feel free, of course, to throw cold water on our dreams if you must... we don't like sugar coating and that feedback helps just as much as it hurts.

Why ask you all to do this?  Easy.  We can talk about this stuff until the cows come home (and we do), but the opinions that really count (to us and to those that listen to us present) are yours.  Either post your thoughts here on FB or send us a note to buzz@boloco.com before end of day 1/4/10... and don't forget to include the last 8 digits of your boloco card.  You'll get 10 points just for sharing, and a freebie (or more) if we use your feedback in the presentation (and its not already been posted).  

Finally, Happy New Year - here's to Twenty Ten being good to all of us!, Louis Kahn said:
