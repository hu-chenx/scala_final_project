Mike is Down the Road’s amazing Sales Director. He’s responsible for getting Down the Road into all of your favorite restaurants and stores. With previous experience in the restaurant industry- he’s worked as a chef in Mexican, Italian, and sushi establishments and also has some management experience- he’s got some firsthand knowledge of what it looks like to carry a beer from a vendor’s point of view. It’s a rather harsh world as breweries compete to be carried and picked up by larger organizations, but Mike has done a wonderful job so far of getting Down the Road into numerous establishments, including seven Applebee’s locations.

The switch from the restaurant world to the beverage world hasn’t been too difficult for Mike. In both, he’s fascinated by the intersection of history, culture, and cuisine. The mission of Down the Road echoes this viewpoint that Mike is drawn to- we brew in traditional styles but with contemporary techniques. Our German Kölsch required weeks of research and testing by Donovan to get it to be similar to what you might find in Germany. Mike likes the fact that, in the end, we’re not looking to craft beers that are paunchy and hard-hitting, but rather ones that you can drink consistently.

As far as favorite drinks go, Mike gives a laugh and states that “I like anything with a proof in it, honestly.” When further pressed to name his favorite beer from Down the Road, Mike claims that to do so “would be like picking a favorite child.” It’s just not possible. With his experience traveling and tasting beer, wine, and tequila, Mike’s got a seasoned palate and knows which alcohols taste good. It’s great to have such a knowledgeable professional on the team!, There are two tastings tonight, both from 5-7pm! We'll be at Burlington Wine and Spirits in Burlington and Upper Falls Liquors in Newton. Be sure to say hello as you come sample our three delicious beers!, Just made a drop at Wegmans Northboro Mass. Pick up some craft brew for the 4th., The real-life Pukwudgie in his natural habitat.
