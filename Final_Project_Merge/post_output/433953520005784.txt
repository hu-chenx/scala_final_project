The third one is failure. You've got to have the ability and understand that you're going to fail. But it's how you recover that makes you a better person. 

And the last, the fourth one is love. Because if you love it then it's not a job, it's a passion.If you love it, you're willing to sacrifice for it, you're willing to go through all types of pains for it ... you are willing to go through that failure and understand that I will be successful. 

And if you go through those four things and you understand those and you can handle those, then success is in your path and greatness is available to you." - Jerome Bettis #MondayMotivation, Happy 70th Birthday to The Kansas City Chiefs great and Class of 1986 Enshrinee, Willie Lanier!
