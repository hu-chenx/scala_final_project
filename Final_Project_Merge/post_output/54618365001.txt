Full Statement from President Scarborough: http://ow.ly/Muu7W, Best wishes to all students as we enter finals week! Extended hours, free coffee and fun events happening this week in the "Study Union.", Regarding the petition and recent posts: The petition certainly demonstrates the community‚Äôs interest in what‚Äôs happening at The University of Akron. And that‚Äôs a good thing. But petitioners are only focused on a name change.  The fact is there have been many suggested names and strategies discussed with President Scarborough, as he has met with students, faculty, staff, community leaders, alumni and others during his first several months here.  

Many variations of the term ‚Äúpolytechnic" have come up in conversation, because polytechnic universities embody a rigorous model of interdisciplinary education that values the arts and humanities as well as science and technology.  

Polytechnic universities focus on applied learning, student engagement in experiential learning (like co-ops and internships), and deep connections between the classroom, community and career.  

President Scarborough has focused the discussions on repositioning the university for the greatest potential for sustained growth, not specifically on a name change.  He will share many of these ideas with the community at his upcoming City Club speech on May 15., You did it Zips!

Main Campus and all the sites ‚Äì Wayne College, Holmes, Medina and Lakewood ‚Äì will be closed from 12:01 a.m. Friday until 12:01 a.m. Saturday because of the extreme temperatures.

The Rec Center, the Student Union and the libraries are closed. Only the residence halls and dining halls are open.

Questions about Friday's scheduled events and activities should be directed to the sponsors or organizers.

Employees designated as emergency personnel should report to work at their regularly scheduled times.

We expect to reopen at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Employees should report to work at their normal start times on Saturday. Employees whose normal shift begins before midnight and ends the following day should report to work at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday to complete the remainder their shifts.

With the National Weather Service issuing a wind chill warning for tonight and continuing through noon tomorrow (upgraded from a current advisory), we have decided to cancel classes effective at 5 p.m. today (Thursday) through noon Friday.  Although Main Campus classes are canceled, campus will be open for business and employees are expected to report to work as normal. The Student Union, the Recreation and Wellness Center and libraries remain open. See below for an adjusted schedule for the Roo Express shuttle service.

Since it is our obligation to keep the university open as much as possible to meet our academic responsibilities to our students, decisions related to the weather, class delays or cancellations, closing campus or canceling activities are always difficult and complicated. We consider many factors, most importantly the safety of students and employees. Additionally, we consider the effects that weather conditions or extreme temperatures may have on our facilities and ability to provide services in light of thousands of students moving across campus and into and out of classroom buildings throughout the day. 

The Provost is communicating with academic leadership the need to consider individual student needs and challenges during this period of time. Students should communicate directly with faculty or advisors if they have questions or concerns.

More information at http://www.uakron.edu/safety/advisory.dot, Questions about Campus Closing?

There have been many questions about the decision that was made last night to keep our campus open, followed by the decision made this morning to close at noon.   Such decisions are not made lightly and the process is informative.

When weather threatens, our facilities and grounds personnel work closely with our campus police to determine the safety conditions on our campus and roads leading to campus.  Last night, with little snow accumulation in the Akron area, and reassurance from the Summit County Sheriff that there was no threat to safety in accessing campus from various roadways, we decided to keep the main campus open.  The decision was different for Lakewood and Medina because the weather conditions in those locations were different‚Äîthe decision to close those sites was based on careful review of specific conditions in those areas.  

This morning, our grounds crews determined that a cold front made it more difficult to sustain conditions on our main campus sidewalks and streets.  As the safety of our students, faculty, and staff is our highest priority, we decided to close the campus at noon.  The worsening conditions caused a reassessment of the situation‚Äîas the weather changes, we continuously reassess‚Äîand we decided to send students, staff and faculty home before conditions further deteriorated.

Please continue to monitor developments on the front page of our web as we announce decisions about campus activities, events, and class schedules in the hours ahead.  More information about the decision-making process is available at http://www.uakron.edu/safety/cold-weather.dot, Due to worsening weather conditions, the Main Campus and all satellite sites will close at noon Monday.

Employees designated as emergency personnel should report to work at their regularly scheduled times.
