Here's the final chapter in our #craigielove story: Kate and Trevor!

Kate and Trevor met when they both worked at Craigie Street Bistrot. Three years after meeting, the two lovebirds got married at Bay End Farm - the same place Chef Tony Maws and his wife, Karolyn, were married, and where Craigie (and The Kirkland Tap & Trotter) buy their produce from seasonally.

Successful leaders need only apply: http://www.craigieonmain.com/?page_id=2546 (Please put "social media" in email subject line when applying)., Today's #craigielove story: Alex and Christina!

In Alex's words: "For anyone who's never seen the location of the original Craigie Street Bistrot, the kitchen was VERY small, which made our Sunday Whim dinners a logistical nightmare for this expeditor. So after about a year of putting myself through this masochistic process every Sunday night, my job suddenly got much easier when a new hire, Christina, came on as my "Whim Buddy," helping Chef Tony and I coordinate how to best get five courses of food out quickly and efficiently for all our guests; it was like she showed up, and everything clicked! But while I could see that she was smart, I didn't totally appreciate her talents until it was time to decommission the former La Groceria in preparation for Tony's move to his new location on Main St. Christina showed up that day with a tool belt and some serious demolition skills, and I was sold. We were married this past August.", Sneak peek at our Valentine's menu: Barley risotto, cardoon purée, veal short rib, black truffle., Valentine's Day is almost here, and we still have a few seats left for lovers on Friday and Sunday evenings. Join us! craigieonmain.com/?page_id=370, We should probably change the name of our Winter is Coming cocktail to Winter Will Never End, but whatever. The blended scotch, sherry, Punt e Mes, & spiced maple caramel help us forget about all that white stuff outside anyway., Believe it or not, quite a few people met and fell in love working at our original restaurant, Craigie Street Bistrot. With Valentine's Day on the horizon, we figured: what better time than to share their funny, sappy, and/or food-fueled love stories? 

To kick things off, we're sharing Lizzie and Owen's story. Owen was Garde Manger, Lizzie was expo. They worked together for nearly a year before they started "dating" - their code was "playing Mario Kart." Lizzie lived just a few blocks away from the restaurant, so it was super convenient for Owen to come over after work. Soon enough, matchmaker Danny caught on to the sparks between them and played a key part in getting them together. Mario Kart led to Monday date nights, where Lizzie and Owen got to know each other and eventually planned their move to Alsace, France, where they lived and worked on a cheese farm for six months together. As Owen likes to say, "We met working together at Craigie, and fell in love in Alsace." #craigielove, Crispy-Fried Smelts with squid ink anchoiade., We love a good snow storm.

Another offering from the hands of Carlos Camarena, the master distiller for Tequila Ocho. These tequilas are about as carefully made as it gets - further, they wave the flag of terroir in the agave distillate, which we certainly support. They have even taken the measure of noting the 'rancho' (like vineyard) and year of agave harvest on their bottles.

Extra Anejo Tequila is a fairly rare category, since Mexican law requires 3 years of barrel age, and it's an expensive endeavor. Ocho uses American Whiskey barrels (so, used charred American oak) that have seen tequila 6-7 times already, so the effect of their wood on spirit is subtle and tasteful., We clearly love tomato season here at Craigie on Main!

It is meant to serve after dinner.  Highly recommended if you haven't tried it!, What are you grilling tomorrow?  We are thinking...

http://bit.ly/IgJ1jo, Kraigie Kitchen Q&A for your culnary edification;

Q. What does "mi-cuit" mean?
A.  We hear this question alot as we use the term to describe many of our fish preparations. So - Literally it means "just barely cooked", but it's more than that. It's lightly roasted, cooked through, but at a really low temperature, so it has some translucency in the center.  Fish cooked the usual way can be dried out on the outer layers and juicy only in the center. Mi-cuit makes the fish very tender and succulent throughout.  
More questions?? Fire away!, Which sounds more delish: Mushroom and Two Cheese Quiche (shown here) or Chicken Fried Country Pork Terrine w fried egg black eyed peas & gravy?

Think smoky but springy. Tried one yet?  Read ingredients and vibe and check it out., Craigie welcomes the wines of Couly-Dutheil

We are so happy to work with this storied property in Chinon.  Once owned by the family of French humanist, Rabelais, the property passed to the Couly’s in 1952.  The Clos de l’Écho, 17 hectares and some of the best vineyard site in the appellation, produces wine with an auspicious ability to age.

Working through channels that went directly to the estate, Craigie has been able to receive a beautiful collection of older wines at very reasonable tariffs.  Vintages 1982, 1995 and 2002 are currently at Craigie and the 2002 is at an everyday tariff.   Also available is a small amount of another cuvee ‘Baronnie Madelaine’ from 1976.  These came directly out of the estate’s cellar and have ideal provenance to taste a bit of history (or perhaps, time preserved). 

We feel so very privileged to have and share these wines with you.  These are high in the running, I might add, for being the best wine with the worst label of the entire year., Help us settle an an animated difference of opinion in our kitchen: What should go on a BBQ pork sandwich(not pulled)?

Here goes re "Francois Childaine’s Montlouis sur Loire 2008
“Les Bornais” Here goes:

"Like Scarlett O’Hara this wine is a demure little Southern belle with an undercurrent of determination and power. It is definitely feminine (not unlike the Les Agiles) and it has a delicate honeysuckle bouquet. It starts with a touch of sweetness that bobs like a flower petal on a raging river of riveting acidity. It tastes of honey and peach skins with a tinge of bitterness like citrus pith and a dense stone minerality.

This wine is all about the subtle balance of opposites: it may be the perfect Chenin Blanc. It is an amazing wine at $63.", On the fence about where to go for Brunch this am?

"OMG We've got a tremendous beer on our list! I've been trying to get a hold of this puppy for a long time, and I'm thrilled we have it. There's a chance it's the most appropriately "Craigie" beer we've ever had. 
Producer: La Choulette
 Beer: "Les Sans Culottes"
 Style: Biere de garde
 ABV: 7%
 It's a rustic northern French style that farmers would make in the winter and spring, when temperatures are more suitable for brewing, and enjoy them in the warmer weather. This one is basically a yeasty, golden, strong pale ale, that has depth and richness of flavor while retaining a moderately light, refreshing body.

Phew. http://www.boston.com/munchmadness, The latest update from Bar Manager Ted:

We've moved on from Pretty Things' St. Botolph's Town, and we've tapped a big old fat keg of something they only made a tiny bit of: it's called "Mild X 1838." It's a richer, hoppier, boozier-than pale ale, most effectively described as an English Strong Ale. Vibrant, lightly opaque & hazy golden/orange-ish color. Strong hop notes, citrus, breadiness, 7.4% ABV. Not really so "mild" at all. 

What's in the name? Dann and Martha at Pretty Things embarked on a fun series in their beer catalogue call the "Once Upon a Time" series, where they use actual brewer's sheets (old recipe guides) and brew them for their historical relevance.

"It smells like a flowering apple orchard I remember in Sumner, Maine, on a Sunday afternoon in May - specifically a Granny Smith apple orchard. Fresh and clean! It has a weighty mouth-feel and a good acidity yet not enough to hold up to horseradish hummus on Triscuits. It would pair well with chicken or turkey or fish in some instances.

It has a citrus flavor like grapefuit, with apple skin tannins and a minerality like mica – that flinty mineral edge that make white wines taste clean like water from a granite quarry spring and it leaves a hint of limestone chalkiness on the tongue., Thanks to all who turned out for last nights "Road Less Travelled Dinner" Duck Testicle Tacos raised a few eyebrows & led the parade of shockingly yummy items.

97% Tempranillo with the balance Graciano - a “new world” style Rioja, it is at first almost jammy and incredibly spicy with an oaky vanilla/cherry thing going on. 

Back in the day when I thought Viader ruled the wine world, I would have loved this wine. Its saving graces are a pronounced acidity and an old world tobacco edge. 

The love of wine is an awakening that cannot be rushed. My first love was a Zinfandel.

This wine is delicious and will wow you if you've just set out upon that road with its mildly challenging spiciness and its old world intimations. It is an awesome addition to our wine list."

Opening in 1 hour!, Newest addition to our beer list, in the words of Bar Manager Ted Gallagher: Oppigards, Well-Hopped Lager

Hello, gang members. Oppigards is a small brewery located on 250 year old family farm in Sweden. The addition of the brewery to the farm has helped revive it, which is great for the farm, but better for the person who gets to drink this beer. It's clean malt content and floral hop presence are impeccably balanced. It boasts English malt and Saaz hops. It pours a gorgeous orangey-straw color, with a fairly dense white head and pretty lacing on the glass.

It's 5% ABV, and comes in a 16.9 oz bottle. We agreed that it would perhaps pair wonderfully with smelts, fried things in general, roast poultry, anything with crispy skin, greens, cheese... It'd also be an enlightened beer for the burger and beer diner in the bar area. Pour it in a chilled Pilsner glass. World-class beer made in small batches on the Swedish country-side., Spotted onTasting Menus lately: Smoked and grilled Spanish eel from Veta la Palma.

Facts: Swiss wines are subject to some of the most logical but strict wine laws in the world. Our Amigne is a " three bee"  wine (that's good) Our wine has some serious residual sugar. It is off-dry much like a German Auslese but has more weight to it. It is also awesome with Craigie food because of its high level of acidity. Live it, love it, drink it. Also check out the website. Like everything else Swiss people do, it makes sense., Fortify yourself for Pats game this pm. Maybe carbo load w a donut or stack o pancakes. OrSalmon roe on Scottish salmon & Albacore Rillettes.

"About two years ago I waited on a man from France who sat solo on ringside and ordered white Burgundy. Clearly disappointed, he told me that for every twenty Burgundies, nineteen are shit, but when you find that 20th, it is worth the search through the mediocrity.
 
This may not be the 20th but it certainly up in the high teens. It is an awesome wine. The mailman in this vineyard must have been Chablis. It has that persistent crisp citrus core yet with a creamy edge; it has a bracing acidity and a hint of limestone minerality. 

It is an edgy wine and angular yet refined enough to intimate roundedness. (It reminds me of the Algonquin Club:)
 
It is a total food wine and definitely worth the experience.", Always amazing what our kitchen wizards can do w fromage de tete.  This time,

"The age of this wine make it quite approachable; it's not a wine of impact and considerably less suited to new world tastes than the other Spanish wines on our list. It is very easy to drink with no big alcohol qualities. That said, it is not lacking in character by any means. 

In about 30-45 minutes, the aroma and flavor  brighten into gorgeous qualities of dried cherry and currant with just a little smoke and leather. 

This is delicious wine that wants to work with food. I think that, once opened for a little bit, it will stand up to almost any meats on our menu. We ate Mexican food with this (chorizo, cheese, tortillas, refried beans) and it was wonderful. Honestly, its developing aroma makes me want some barbecue. I'm dreaming of that spice-crusted rib with this wine. In short, this is badass wine that is a bit more delicate than the other Spanish reds.", New to the menu -( just in case you didn't already have these for lunch today)!
