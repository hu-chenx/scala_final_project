The Feast of the Seven Fishes
http://postoboston.com/menus.html

Legend has it that the long tradition of eating seafood on Christmas Eve dates back to the Roman Catholic tradition of abstinence when southern Italians would observe the ‚ÄúCena della Vigilia‚Äù, or Christmas Eve dinner. According to catholic family traditions, Italians would fast on Christmas Eve in anticipation of the birth of the baby Jesus on Christmas Day.  Since meat cannot be eaten during the fast, families would indulge in seven different types of fish or ‚Äúfishes‚Äù.  

While the feast may have religious significance to some people, all of us at Posto think of the Feast of Seven Fishes as a celebration of sharing Italian food, spending time with family and the joy of the year-end holiday season.

Join us and celebrate the Feast of the Seven Fishes on December 24th as we prepare a multi course menu celebrating the abundance and freshness of New England Seafood.
