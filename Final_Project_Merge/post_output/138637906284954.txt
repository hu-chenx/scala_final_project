"Within him, as he hurled himself forward, was born a love, a despairing fondness for this flag which was near him. It was a creation of beauty and invulnerability. It was a goddess, radiant, that bended its form with an imperious gesture to him. It was a woman, red and white, hating and loving, that called him with the voice of his hopes. Because no harm could come to it he endowed it with power. He kept near, as if it could be a saver of lives, and an imploring cry went from his mind.", To our veterans, those who have fallen and those who remain: We salute you., Someone told BostInno that we're a great place to meet a special someone, and we'd be lying if we said we haven't seen a fair amount of flirtation in our cafe and in the bookstore..., TRIVIA TROLLS: Trivia is still happening tonight at 8:30, but before Trivia there's a Sorority Mixer that ends at 8, so we'll be taking reservations for upstairs tables for Trivia whenever you can get here.

The air became gray and opalescent; a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way; then another light; then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision. Under his feet a thick, iron-studded skylight turned yellow; in the street the lamps of the taxi-cabs sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement. The unwelcome November rain had perversely stolen the day’s last hour and pawned it with that ancient fence, the night."

O'Brien started the snowball, then I picked it up, then ILM picked it up and now the computer generation is picking it up. Where it will end, I don't know. Maybe in holography, although I'm not sure I'd like a grotesque monster appearing in 3-D in my living room."

This time he's transplanted to the future dystopian technocratic dictatorship of Alphaville to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor Von Braun.  It gets stranger from there.  Not to be missed, this film was clearly inspired by such films as Metropolis and Things to Come and would go on to inspire such films as Blade Runner.

With his rock band the Hong Kong Cavaliers, can Buckaroo defeat the alien menace and save Earth?  Find out in this week's episode, tonight at 7:30!

It's a wonderful slice of the future from 1984 - the self-referential wit of Arrested Development, the plucky, quirky characters of Wes Anderson and the brainy SCIENCE fiction of the latest incarnations of Dr. Who all rolled into a wonderful, whimsical film.
