With their exotic, golden flavour and dramatic spiky crown, pineapples are clearly the king of the fruit world. Their original name was “Ananas,” from the Tupi word for “excellent fruit” – we couldn’t have said it better ourselves. Here we blend big pieces of pineapple with Tie Kwan Yin oolong tea, for the perfect balance of fresh, fruity and floral. The result? A bright, refreshing blend that’s equally amazing hot or iced. Trust us – it’s like drinking a cup of sunshine.

http://bit.ly/VI4XfD

The ancient Chinese used it in medicine. The medieval Europeans traded for it along the Silk Road. And today we love it in pies, sauces, muffins or just plain, dipped in a little sugar. But the best way to eat rhubarb is with sweet, ripe strawberries. Like in this refreshingly fruity, deep red tisane. It tastes as bright and juicy as a fresh-picked berry, with a tart rhubarb punch and a subtle hint of yogurt creaminess. We love it hot or iced, or as the base for sweet, zippy sangria. Now that’s a beautiful thing.

When South African rooibos is quickly withered and steamed to prevent oxidation, it retains its green colour rather than turning a dark red.

Bad colds require great interventions. Take this tea, for example. It’s a deliciously soothing mix of peppermint, juniper berries and orange peel. Pretty great, right? If that’s not extreme enough for you, you could try eating raw garlic, or gargling salt water, or inhaling lots of steam. Yeah...we didn’t think so. Probably better just to stick to the tea.

Blueberries might just be the greatest fruit around – after all, they’re the star ingredient of North America’s favourite muffin. And hundreds of years before moms were making them into jams, jellies and cakes, blueberries were called “star berries” and revered for their healing powers. Another little known fact about blueberries is that they make for one great cup of tea – when you blend them with black tea, elderberries, cornflowers and stevia, it’s the perfect companion to your morning toast.

It looks all normal when it’s loose. But steep it and you’ll see that it’s nuts. Within seconds, this tempting jumble of almond slices and chunks, apple bits and cinnamon bark starts turning a crazy shade of pink. Why? Because it contains a hint of beetroot.

The ancient Chinese used it in medicine. The medieval Europeans traded for it along the Silk Road. And today we love it in pies, sauces, muffins or just plain, dipped in a little sugar. But the best way to eat rhubarb is with sweet, ripe strawberries. Like in this refreshingly fruity, deep red tisane. It tastes as bright and juicy as a fresh-picked berry, with a tart rhubarb punch and a subtle hint of yogurt creaminess. We love it hot or iced, or as the base for sweet, zippy sangria. Now that’s a beautiful thing.

This may have been a long, cold winter, but this exotic fruit-filled black tea is a sure sign of sunnier days ahead.

One cup and you’ll feel like dancing for joy., TEA OF THE DAY: DAYDREAMER - SPRING COLLECTION
http://bit.ly/ZgDTSx

At our annual staff party last summer, we invented the best drink ever: iced green tea with mango-flavoured ice cubes. It was totally refreshing and subtly fruity, like drinking a cup of green tea while daydreaming about tropical fruit. Hence the name: The Daydreamer. We’ve recreated it for you here, with a sencha green tea lightly flavoured with mango, guava and mangousteen. Steep a cup and dream a little dream of tea., SPRING COLLECTION LAUCH: 

Spring is in the air! Our 2013 Spring Collection is finally here, with five exotic teas to fill your cup. A much-needed infusion of freshness after a long, cold winter.

Meet mango with an attitude: this sweet and spicy blend of green tea, mango and red hot chili threads is irresistibly refreshing on ice. Mango and chili might seem like an unusual combination, but you can actually find it in sauces, salsas and salads everywhere from Thailand to Mexico.

There are tons of reasons to love ginger. It’s been used as a digestive aid for thousands of years: Confucius wrote in 500 BC that he never ate a meal without some on hand. And according to ayurveda, ginger balances excess kapha or sluggishness. Plus there’s nothing more soothing on a sore throat than ginger’s spicy heat. With ginger, green tea, licorice and orange peel, this sweet and spicy blend is a real multitasker – and it still finds time to taste great.

Traditional Chinese medicine says walnuts are a warming food. Which makes sense, because this is the kind of tea you spontaneously want to cozy up to on a cold winter afternoon. The comforting, lightly bitter taste of toasted walnuts is sweetened and deepened with dried pineapple, coconut, almond and organic green tea. Sip it in front of an open fire and chase away the cold.

When it comes to rooibos, some say green is the new red. Because while red rooibos tastes great, some say the new wave of unoxidized green rooibos is even better. What’s so special? The production process, which is similar to that of green tea, gives it a smooth, fresh taste. Here we’ve topped it up with the tropical flavours of papaya, apple, mango and peach.

It looks all normal when it’s loose. But steep it and you’ll see that it’s nuts. Within seconds, this tempting jumble of almond slices and chunks, apple bits and cinnamon bark starts turning a crazy shade of pink. Why? Because it contains a hint of beetroot. That’s what gives this rich almond tea its earthy depth and its all-natural signature colour. Deliciously nutty, decidedly addictive.

Star anise is one of the most beautiful spices around…and also one of the most delicious. It has a sweet, subtle licorice taste that we just can’t resist. And some say it has magical properties: keeping star anise around is said to bring you good luck, happy dreams and even clairvoyance. Most importantly, it makes for some seriously delicious tea. Star anise and Ceylon black tea is a classic combination, but here we sweeten the deal even more with white chocolate, cocoa nibs and coconut. The result is sweet and creamy, with a hint of exotic spice. Now that’s star power.

Combining pu’erh and ginger is like creating an arsenal. These are two of Chinese medicine’s best weapons, each with their own long history of legends and traditional uses. They also happen to be delicious. Especially when blended with a hint of orange, for a hint of citrus to complement the zesty earthiness.

With their exotic, golden flavour and dramatic spiky crown, pineapples are clearly the king of the fruit world. Their original name was “Ananas,” from the Tupi word for “excellent fruit” – we couldn’t have said it better ourselves. Here we blend big pieces of pineapple with Tie Kwan Yin oolong tea, for the perfect balance of fresh, fruity and floral. The result? A bright, refreshing blend that’s equally amazing hot or iced. Trust us – it’s like drinking a cup of sunshine.

China's wonder tonic
For more than 1,700 years, the Chinese have been drinking pu'erh. It is traditionally aged underground, and as with fine wine, the older it is, the more prized its taste. This tea is an excellent example. Aged for five years deep in the mountain caves of Yunnan province, it has that special, sought-after hint of mustiness with strong earthy notes.

A popular wedding gift in China, Huang Jin Gui is prized for its pretty yellow colour and romantic floral scent. Here we bring out this special leaf’s orchid aroma with a touch of vanilla.

Tea or coffee…why can’t it be both? With this blend, you can have it all. We took a spiced black tea with cardamom, cinnamon and ginger, then added whole coffee beans to jazz it up. It has a subtler, richer flavour than many of our chais, with a big hit of floral spice from the cardamom and a tasty depth from the coffee beans. We love drinking it hot or iced, but you’ve really got to try it as a latte – with lots of foam and a dash of cinnamon, it’ll be the best decision you make all day.

Have you heard of the barbegazi? According to Swiss lore, they are a group of furry little men that live high in the Alps. They are known for their long, icy beards and enormous feet, which they use to ski down hills and surf on avalanches. But how do they stay warm up in the frozen mountains all year round? We like to think it’s with a fortifying brew like this spiced rooibos, with apple, cinnamon, and ginger. If you see some very big footprints next time you’re out hiking, follow them to the barbegazi’s cave and see if they offer you a cup.

Star anise is one of the most beautiful spices around…and also one of the most delicious. It has a sweet, subtle licorice taste that we just can’t resist. And some say it has magical properties: keeping star anise around is said to bring you good luck, happy dreams and even clairvoyance. Most importantly, it makes for some seriously delicious tea. Star anise and Ceylon black tea is a classic combination, but here we sweeten the deal even more with white chocolate, cocoa nibs and coconut. The result is sweet and creamy, with a hint of exotic spice. Now that’s star power., Fuel up with tea this holiday season!

Why save all the festivity for New Year’s Eve? Just making it out of bed on time deserves a toast. Do your socks match today? Bring on the bubbly! And this festive blend of green tea, candied pineapple, and champagne flavour is worth getting excited about. Sweet, fruity, and complex, it’s the perfect way to make every occasion special. Try it chilled in champagne flutes with crisp honey-drizzled pears or fresh berries.

When we think of the holidays, we imagine ourselves playing in the snow, or sitting in front of a roaring fire. But let’s face it, we all spend most of the season in our kitchens. There are cookies to bake. Feasts to prepare. And most importantly, tea to brew. Like this festive fruit-and-spice green tea blend, bursting with cranberries, apples, cinnamon and star anise. One cup fills us with so much holiday cheer, we feel like jumping up and kissing someone. But maybe that’s just because the secret ingredient is mistletoe…

It all starts with the very best leaves: a premium oolong from China’s Fujian Province called Huang Jin Gui. A popular wedding gift in China, Huang Jin Gui is prized for its pretty yellow colour and romantic floral scent. Here we bring out this special leaf’s orchid aroma with a touch of vanilla.

No wonder – they’re naturally sweet and rich, with an almost caramel-like flavour. In a word, decadent. Here we pair golden mulberries with creamy coconut and delicate white tea, for a tea that is guaranteed to give you gold fever. Eureeka!

It was well past midnight, but David was still up. He couldn’t sleep. He was hearing sounds. First there was a rushing sound like water from the faucet. Then an awful, high-pitched scream. Terrified, he ran into the kitchen. Aromatic steam filled the room. It smelled wonderful – rich and sweet, like chocolate and oranges. The screaming sound was coming…from the kettle. He sat down, relieved. He picked up a cup and took a sip. There was nothing to fear after all – this ghost was friendly.

http://www.davidstea.com/newsletter/December-newsletter-web.html, Okay so here's the story:

When we launch our seasonal collections we have a meeting about a month before where our design team will come in and show us a collection of different ideas for our store-front windows. Our designers are really great, so 9 times out of 10 we all agree on a design and it goes to print. No fuss. No Muss.

This fall however, we were presented with with two options for our Winter windows that we thought were amazing. 

The first option (the one you will see in all of our stores) is a very serene, artistic showing of snowflakes falling- but designed to also look like a fireworks display. It fits perfectly into our Winter 2009 motif:  'Celebrate Winter'. 

The second option was this. It depicts two snowmen, one happy, one very obviously dead. Admittedly a tad morbid, but we think it's cheeky, cute and fun. He's melted because he couldn't resist his tea! What a committed tea drinker. It was debated for some time, but we made the right choice and went with our snowflake celebration design. We decided not to publicly kill frosty in the windows of all our stores (this year, anyways) and do our part to preserve the innocence of our younger tea drinkers. But we still think it's great, and definitely worth sharing.

We've converted it into a 1280 x 800 desktop background that you can download at the link below.

Enjoy :)
