Kelly Ross Photography, Hot off the presses.... this little man just left the studio less than a hr ago and I just couldn't wait to post at least one for mom... he was a perfect angel!!!, I always credit the start to my business to Ana Brandt 5 years ago when I started my photography career I wanted to dive into newborns and had no idea what I was doing and I honestly googled "newborn posing" and up popped a ton of videos showing her posing - when she started she was working with tiny little spaces and it motivated me if she can do it I sure can try to.... so now 5 yrs later she is not only a inspiration, mentor but a good friend.... I have often said I could sit and listen to her talk business all day.... for those of you unable to attend one of her workshops in person she is being featured for a 3 day creative live event... where you can watch her work her magic LIVE and free ... The best part is if you are unable to watch it live you can buy it for $99 and watch on your own time and have the segments to go back and watch over and over again to find new inspiration... I am just so excited for her to have this opportunity even if I sound like an infomercial LOL , A little Pre- Holiday Sale.... If you had a session in 2012/2013 and already placed an order you can purchase your digital images from your session for $149 (+tax) 
email Colleen - kellyrossphotography.colleen@gmail.com Sale is running through this Friday 11/8 at noon... All images will be sent to you for direct download., www.Kelly Ross Photography.com

LOL esp all those sweet newborns...., Kelly Ross, Just letting all of my clients know that I will not be scheduling any more Holiday sessions after December 10th... to take time and enjoy some of the holiday season with my family!!! There are a couple limited sessions still open... Deadlines also for sessions that have already been held for ordering is Dec 10th.... any orders you want must be placed with me by then... Message me with any questions!, read this and had to repost!!! If you ask yourself why Photographers "charge so much" for shooting ... They don't get paid vacation, they don't get paid sick days, they don't get bonuses for outstanding performances nor for Christmas. They don't have insurance plans nor do they qualify for unemployment. They sacrifice their family on special days so that they can bring happiness to others. Illness or personal affairs are not excuses for a bad shooting or staying home. Next time you ask, remember that Photographers are Photographers because of the love of photography, but that love doesn't pay bills. Happy Photographer's Day!! Re-post if you're a Photographer or have good friends that are Photographers. RESPECT THE PHOTOGRAPHER!!!!!!!!, Congrats to Marcia and Kevin and welcome Maeghan to the world.... 8lbs!!!!
