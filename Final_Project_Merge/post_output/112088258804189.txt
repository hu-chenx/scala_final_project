I was really looking forward to working with and playing vs Gilas and to help them to get ready for the World Cup. But more than anything, I  was looking forward to helping MVP Sports, PLDT and EWP raise funds to support those effected by typhoon Yolanda. 

When EWP approached me about partnering with MVP and PLDT for this event, I knew that they had the best intentions of doing something great for the people of the Philippines!

I am definitely coming back next year and again doing clinics and appearances.  Hopefully I'm also able to actually play in an sanctioned game against the Gilas teams!

To further support MVP's efforts, I am donating to MVP's foundation to help support recovery efforts in the Philippines! Together we can make a difference!
