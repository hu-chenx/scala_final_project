Don't get me wrong, I still plan on having ros√©s throughout the holidays, but today I'm feeling a little French "oh-l√†-l√†." Would you like to help me spice it up with a sweet little number from Burgundy? Just in time for TGIF!

Join us!
Cin Cin,
Catherine, As some go kicking and screaming into the fall, do not fret! We still have stunning ros√©s. I met a sweet gent today who revealed with some embarrassment that he was still enjoying his ros√©. Delighted with his proclamation, I shared with him that we at Bee's Knees will be pouring our's throughout the holidays! He promised to visit. I'm hoping he is reading this because he is adorable. I'm just sayin...
In fact, we are getting low and will be ordering more! If you have any requests please let us know! We love to please:)
For those that are thrilled with the thought of fall we have you covered. Our "Oktoberfest" and Pumpkin beer coffers are flying out the door. We just did a reorder and added some newbies!
So let's all celebrate the season and share a glass! We are always pouring something!
Join us,

 ENJOY!!!!, Kick off Labor Day weekend by swinging by Bee's Knees today (Thursday) for a beer tasting from 4-6 pm! We are pouring some goodies from Blue Hills Brewery so quit laboring about what to drink this weekend and come sample!, Earthquakes and other nature related events!
This past week Napa rattled and wine barrels rolled during a 6.0 rumbler. One such vineyard is owned and operated by the Hendry family.
On August 20th Molly and Mike celebrated the birth of a son. 36 hours late the earthquake hit their vineyard and it sustained considerable damage. On some level we at Bee's Knees want to do our little bit to help. So, we are pouring a stunning Hendry Pinot Noir. 
Let us all lift a glass and remember those who have toiled to make that experience possible.
Cheers to baby Hendry!

The result is a mouthful of coffee flavor with hints of smoke and chocolate. And, if you like a little treat with your coffee then Rogue's Voodoo Dougnut will have you asking for seconds. This surprisingly big brown ale has notes of raspberry, pretzel, coffee and chocolate. All this with out the spare tire!  
If brew is not your fancy, then we have ros√© bubbles to tickle your taste buds! Something for everyone! Join us at noon today! Our cheese monger, Jarron, promises to impress with two new offerings from a local organic farm. Just in the door yesterday. I had a sneak peek and all I could say was YUMMY!

Come on in and let's celebrate together!
We are open from 10AM-6PM.

CinCin,
Catherine, The only thing girly about this is the pink bottle.
Think Guinness kissed by a chocolate covered raspberry. Where's my main squeeze? This is a big brown ale, definitely not for the faint of heart !!!
Come on in for a taste-

Cin Cin, 
Catherine, "It's 5 o'clock somewhere" and we are ready to chill out with a beautiful Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. This baby screams pink grapefruit! The finish is smooth, dry and no surprise...refreshing! Join us. Bring friends. It's party time!

Cin Cin,
Catherine, Well, our Gamay gem is selling like crazy. Amanda from Boston says "it makes you want to run in the sunshine." She bought one for her and one for her mom. Are you listening my darling daughter???, Happy Friday! It's a great day to sit outside and sip something refreshing. We just opened a fabulous little bubbly from France made from 100% Gamay! Matthew from Detroit just proclaimed, "tastes like summer!" See what you think. Come join us-

Cin Cin,
Catherine, "Its 5 o'clock somewhere" and we just got in a gorgeous Gruner Veltliner. Full of aromatic fruits, with crisp acidity, this Gruner has a surprisingly long dry finish, perfect with seafood and shellfish dishes. What better day to sip something refreshing! Come join us-

Cin Cin,

Join us-

Cin Cin,
Catherine, Yes! We made it. "13 Days of Ros√©s" and I'm contemplating our commencement pour. Let the fun begin! We've sipped together, shared our thoughts and formed opinions. It's time!

You will be coming back for more! 
Join us-  
Cin Cin,
Catherine, Day 10 of "13 Days of Ros√©s" and we head back to the states. The same winemaker as yesterdays Provence pour, with a totally different style as American as the flag! Bold, dry, a "tug-of-war" between sweet and savory with a snappy acidity this is a refreshing winner.
Come in and join us!

Cin Cin,
Catherine, BEER! Why should all the wine-o's have all the fun? Bee's Knees is sample Mikkeller today! 
Hoppy, citrusy perfect summer pours.
Join Cyndi and me and try something new.
Sante!, Happy Saturday! 
Day 9 of "13 days..." And we head south to where it all began, Provence. The vineyard is in the ancient village of Lauris, surrounded by olive groves and vines. But don't let that fool you. The wine maker is zany and quirky and so is this ros√©!
Join us!

Cin Cin,
Catherine, Happy Thursday-day 6 of "Thirteen Days of Ros√©s". I'm feeling La Familia today. So, off we go to Sicilia! The weather in Menfi is perfect for sipping this homemade Bellezza. Pale pink, wafts of Ribera wild strawberries and pomegranate mingle with the salty air and I'm transformed. "Scotty, do NOT beam me up"
Join me and let's pretend together!

Cin Cin!
Catherine, Day 6 of "13 days of Ros√©'s" and we head back state side to Oregons's Willamette Valley. A blend of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Gew√ºrztraminer! This beauty is loaded fresh fruits, raspberry, watermelon and a faint hint of wildflower honey. A pool party sipper to please all!

Cin Cin,
Catherine, Day 5 of "13 days..." And we head north to Sancerre! Today we sip a beautiful Pinot Noir Ros√© that will have you craving a deck party and spicy grilled shrimp!
Come in and join us!

Cin Cin,
Catherine, "It's 5 o'clock somewhere"...
It's Monday, and as I lingered over my melon I was reminded of the lovely aromas and tastes of C√¥tes de Provence Ros√© After the austere, woodsy California Ros√© we poured for dad, we are going south. South of France that is! Our day 4 Ros√© is full of ripe strawberries and melon notes. We start at 2 so come on in and join us!

Cin Cin,
Catherine, "It's 5 o'clock somewhere! "
Saturday June 14th, day two of thirteen days of rose! In honor of Dad's day, we are pouring a very dry rose with an oaky finish that will match any medium bodied red. If the darker color doesn't lure you in then maybe the name and label. Revolver "Blood and Roses" is deep, dark and woody. A masculine profile with a dry tannin finish. Come on in out of the rain and try something new!

Cin Cin,

Catherine, It's Friday, treat yourself with our Half Chicken Special with side of garlic & dill mushed potatoes and pan fried corn. üç¥üçó, ROSE COLORED GLASSES!
Happy Friday the Thirteenth! Let's climb out from under the covers and celebrate Friday the Thirteenth of June! Bees Knees is embarking on a quest to find the perfect rose for you! Over the next 13 days we will be tasting a different rose to tempt our palates!  
Ok, so this isn't suppose to be a rosy day.  I know something about superstition. My grandmother use to chant over a bowl of olive oil and water studying the size and quantity of the oil drops. Every time her Italian girl friends would compliment her, " Catherine your children are so beautiful" she'd be back over the bowl. Personally, I don't believe in such folly. Hmm...I've been in Boston 2 months. My car has been hit twice, and I'm on my 4th aerobed. The first 3 sprang a leak. "Grandma can you her me"? 
Teasing aside I did find one reference to justify possible cause for concern. And, surprise! An Italian was involved: 
"He [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring friends; and if it be true that, like so many Italians, he regarded Fridays as an unlucky day and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday 13th of November he passed away."
Let's ignore lore and toast to today!

Cin Cin,

Catherine., Come try our cold avocado and cucumber soup today. It's gluten free, healthy and delicious! We also have two hot soups, our deli sandwiches and salads to choose from. Deli special today is 3 meatball sub!!!, Tonight I had my first private wine tasting with the eclectic, vino savvy SEWER group, acronym for South End Wine Evaluation and Review.
WOW! What a great gathering of wine enthusiasts. We sipped, debated, scribbled, whispered, talked amongst ourselves, and shared. Let me be clear. This group is not for the faint of heart. They know some stuff. You have to be on your toes and ready for any and all little know or "who cares" facts! They clearly do! And as it turns out, so do I! What is the TA in the last glass you sipped?
We had a blast. I'm not sure they learned anything from me but I certainly did from them, and the conversation was electric. All this was without a doubt enhanced by the clever cheese pairings of our new cheese monger Jaron.
It was a very late night. It was indeed a great night. 
Our thanks to Jim Truitt for making it all happen. 
Shout out to our Braidie for all you kind assistance:)
Just can't wait for the next one.

Cin Cin,

Catherine, Come grab your lunch at Bee's Knees. Meatball sub as a special, Basho Sushi, chicken vegetable and spring vegetable soup and of course our delicious deli sandwiches and salads to choose from!, "Raining days and Mondays" don't have to get you down! All our chanting over roses seems to have paid off. At least for now, it appears that summer has arrived and we are celebrating with rose. Let's continue our education into the world of roses and try yet another great pour from France! Tres Bon!

Cin Cin,

Catherine, It's a sunny Friday, a beautiful weekend ahead of us, and you know you want a milkshake to reward yourself after a long week! Come to Bee's Knees and pick your flavor either from Batch or vegan FoMu!, "It's 5 o'clock somewhere" is thrilled to announce our TGIF offering! We are sampling a luscious big Cabernet blend from Healdsburg, Ca. Just when I thought this "baby" was a Bordeaux blend the wine maker threw in 5% Syrah for giggles. I had the pleasure last week and WOW! I found myself savoring each sip and the nuances that time revealed. Not my usual style of drinking but this beauty commands respect. Come join us, and see what you think!

Cin Cin,

Welcome to the Bees Knee's wine blog!

I have a very dear friend from Spain, Roberto. Each year we would splurge and celebrate our birthdays at the Four Seasons for breakfast. 

I guess we thought we couldn't afford brunch. One year we met at 10:30 AM. I mentioned to my friend that I really wanted a glass of champagne. His response, "Please Catherine, It's 5 o'clock somewhere!"

To pay homage to this time-honored quip, BEE'S KNEES SUPPLY CO. will be pouring a little something every day around 2 PM. (The new 5!).

Help us kick it off today, with a gorgeous Rose bubbly from Premier wine maker Graham Beck.  Graham Beck Wines, now entering its 3rd generation as a family winery, was established in 1983 in the oldest wine region in South Africa.  

This lively Rose is 51% Pinot Noir and 49% Chardonnay.  Full of ripe cherry and strawberries, "with its racy acidity, and with a powerful creamy textured, peachy finish" this little beauty is perfect for any celebratory occasion.

Wine & Beer Department we will be tasting a brand new arrival: Root: 1 Sauvignon Blanc  2013 from the Casablanca Valley in Chile!

Subtle but nicely complex with dried herb, citrus and slightly nutty aromas. This wine is easy drinking, medium weight on the palate with restrained and slightly creamy texture that shows a nice base of orange and candied pineapple with a hint of ginger to it. The finish is very clean...

Drop by, say hello to Catherine and try a sip!  We think you will love it as much as we do!, BEE'S KNEES SUPPLY CO. & Floral Lab are having a hanging plant sale today.  Drop by and check out these fantastic flowers!, Is it starting to feel a bit chilly outside after this beautiful weekend?

Our respect to all who have bravely served our country., BEE's KNEES SUPPLY CO. Wine and Beer Department is proud to be offering a tasting of 2012 Azienda Agricola Eugenio Rosi Riflesso Rosi Vallagarina IGT!

A crisp Italian rosato: Beautiful, quite strong rose, candy like colour. Classy. Nose: elegant; ripe wild strawberries, bit sweet. Fresh anyway plus later strawberry notes. Taste: rhubarb, tea; some strawberry and red currant flavors in the finish. Sweetness and freshness together. Despite quite low acidity great balance.

The 2012 Bonny Doon Vin Gris de Cigare & The Villa Wolf Ros√© de Pinot Noir.  Drop by, say hello to Catherine and enjoy a sip or two!, For tasting today in The BEE'S KNEES SUPPLY CO. Wine and Beer Department is the 2012 Bonny Doon Vin Gris de Cigare - drop by, say hello to Catherine and give it a taste!

Fresh and bright with a shell pink color reminiscent of a Cotes de Provence Ros√©. Since this is a true Vin Gris, and perforce receives but the most minimal skin contact, it is very discreet both in hue and aromatic profile. There are hints of wild strawberry, white cherry, ripe peach, and the barest whiff of spearmint, giving way to notes of strawberry, blood orange, and grapefruit. A very lean, mineral-intensive structure draws one into the wine, rather than assaults one with a riotous floral/fruity bombardment. 

Perhaps most compelling is the wine's tremendous food-friendliness. Wonderful with traditional Provencal fare including charcuterie, pate, salade nicoise, and the aioli platter, it's an incredibly flexible partner at the table, complementing everything from international cuisine‚Äîcurries, tagines, or chiles rellenos‚Äîto a vast array of seafoods, poultry, salads, and cheeses. 

62% Grenache, 17% Mourvedre, 9% Roussanne, 6% Grenache Blanc, 6% Cinsault, Taste some great Bee's Knees jams while waiting for your sandwich! It's happening now!, Our collaboration with Floral Lab at BEE'S KNEES SUPPLY CO. has a flower sale today!  Fresh and cut flowers are included in the sale items.  Drop by!, BEE'S KNEES SUPPLY CO. will be tasting THE CURATOR 2011 RED WINE today from 3PM until 8 PM in the Wine & Beer Department!

The Curator is made by the Badenhorst Family Wines of the Swartland region of South Africa, known for their Secateurs label. This red blend is made up of Shiraz, Mourv√®dre, Cinsault and Viognier. On the nose there is a good deal of spice, including cinnamon, clove, anise and black pepper. There is also a fair amount of smoke within the dark fruit overtones. The blend tastes of currants, blueberries, blackberries and a hint of strawberry. Due to the exotic blend of grapes in this wine, it will pair well with many dishes including lamb stew, sweet barbecued ribs or chicken.

Drop by and give it a try!, On this sunny Saturday, we will be tasting The Villa Wolf Ros√© de Pinot Noir, a true ros√©, made with a brief maceration before pressing to extract a lovely salmon color. It is light and refreshing, with bright berry and fruit flavors and a clean, zippy finish. 

We will be pairing it with a Bavarian Blue cheese.
