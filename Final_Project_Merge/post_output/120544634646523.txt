Boudoir for the cure
Face it, a boudoir session is not something you do everyday. But it is an experience I believe every woman should have at least once in her life ( if not two or three times ) you are not alone is you are incredibly nervous about doing a boudoir session. The best way to relieve some of those nerves is to ask as many questions as you need. The more you know about your session the more comfortable you will feel the day of the shoot. So please do not hesitate t ask any questions you might have, even if you have a hundred  of them I am here to answer them all and there are no silly questions, Ever! 

Question:
Who will be my photographer? 

Answer: 
ME! Amanda Stevens and a few of my very favorite female photographers from the Boston area. 


Question: 
What should I expect during my session?

Answer: 
The short answer…. FUN! Now that I have that established here is the longer answer. You will arrive at the event site, pour yourself a beverage to calm your nerves, meet with one of our volunteers to fill out your paperwork. Then sit down for hair and makeup. Once your glam time is complete, it is camera time! As we go through your session we will tell you what to do with your hands, where to look, what to do with your mouth and everything else to bring out our inner super model! 

Question: 
Lets talk privacy! What’s going to happen to my pictures and do they need to be on your website? 

Answer: 
Privacy is very important to us. We want to make sure you are completely comfortable with who will and will not see your pictures. Because of this we have established a privacy policy that we go over with you. Your pictures DO NOT have to go up on our individual websites or anywhere else for that matter. All of the gorgeous ladies you see on our websites have given us permission to show them off. Just as you may have seen some of our work online before deciding to work with us others like to also so we appreciate when people allow it. Part of the policy discusses whether you would allow us to show parts of you ( such as your hands, feet and anything except your face) never using your full name of course. Don’t want anyone to see them except for you/ You got it!   

Question: 
Retouching!! What’s the deal with that?

Answer:
Retouching is probably the most asked about topic. Each lady will receive 1 re touched 8x10 for free of their choice. All of their other files will be put on a password protected photo sharing site for you to chose the photographs you like the most that you would like to order for you and that special person In your life! We offer prints, books, calendars and many more items. All proceeds from orders will also be going to the American cancer society. All photographs you choose will be re touched including things like stray hairs, bruises, skin blemishes. Our job during the shoot is to pose you in ways that are the most flattering to you there for there is no reason to “alter” your photographs to make you look like something you are not You will look amazing, we are sure of it! If you have specific re touching requests ask us if we can do it for you! 

Question; 
What is your typical client like?

Answer: 
ALL woman 18 and over! I know that seems like a really broad answer but it is true. All shapes, sizes, races, etc. Every woman is unique and beautiful. Our job is to bring that out through your photographs and we plan to make you see how gorgeous you are! 

Question: 
Why have a boudoir session? 

Answer: 
WHY NOT! You deserve it. Here are just a few of the different reasons we have heard over the years why woman want to show off their inner vixen. 
* Number one reason for Boudoir for the cure~ ALL proceeds go to the American Cancer Society. So why not have a day of beauty, self esteem booster and donate to an amazing charity! 
* They are getting married, trust us give a gift to your hubby to be and he will be running down the aisle to marry you.!
* It is they’re anniversary! A boudoir session is great for any anniversary but remember your 1 year is paper.. So why  not fill the paper with sexy pictures of you! 
* Girls night out! Not that you need a reason to hang out with the girls but why not get a lasting gift out of it. 
* They just got divorced or dumped. Ahh! I know that sounded depressing but talk about an instant self esteem booster, plus he will never know how much he is loosing out! 
*They have 1,2,3+ kids and they want to feel sexy 
* Its they’re 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th or 60th birthday and they deserve it! 
* It’s a special occasion. A boudoir session makes a great valentines day, holiday and birthday gift! 
* And Just because!!!! Face it life is crazy and short, women are go getters and over achievers, its time to take a few hours and pamper yourself. 

Question: 
What about hair and makeup? 

Answer: 
Hair and make up is included in your “boudoir for the cure” shoot. So arrive an hour before hand with clean hair and face. Complete you paperwork and sit down, relax and be pampered! 

Question: 
What should I wear for my photo shoot?  

Answer: 
AHH! Outfit planning for your session! It can be a n of fun but can also be stressful. There are all sorts of different outfit options here are a few to get you started. Bras, panties, ( something to match your bra and some that don’t) Corsets, teddies, men’s shirt, tank tops, garters, thigh high stockings, sports jerseys or anything else you feel beautiful and sexy in. don’t forget sexy heels and jewelry. 

Question: 
Can I bring a friend? 

Answer: 
Yes as long as she is female. Even better if she books a shoot a head of time and you both come and enjoy the day together! REMEMBER all the money goes to charity! 
*************************************************************************************************************
What To Wear 
Clothing, partial clothing, and implied nudity can all be sexy so plan your clothing items around what your comfort level is. Bring tried and true items you already have and feel beautiful while wearing. If you plan on shopping, make sure you’ve tried the clothing on, moved around, and love it. You will look the sexiest when you feel confident and good inside. Keep in mind, this is ultimately about what you want, what you like, and what you want to see yourself in. Your clothing should reflect your taste and personal style which we will in turn match with our studio sets and props.
Bra and Panties
Most importantly, bring a varied selection of bra and panty sets. Start with basic black and then add colors and patterns. Bras and panties can be photographed alone or paired with any of the other clothing items or accessories you bring. They are also helpful when setting up implied nude poses. 
Lingerie
A baby doll nightie, vintage slip, teddy and/or camisole always photograph well. Corsets with thigh high stockings, a garter belt, and heels are super sexy too. We have built our studio to work with all colors as well as various patterns and fabrics. Start simple and grow more extreme from there. Think about what colors look good on you. Maybe even ask your fiance/husband/boyfriend what outfits he likes or what colors he prefers on you — in an unsuspicious way of course!
Casual Attire
Everyday clothing such as sheer tops, jeans, shorts, and pajamas can look cute and sexy if photographed properly. A simple white tank top or cami is a must have! An evening gown will add some class. If this is a gift for your fiance/husband/boyfriend, then bring something from his wardrobe. This can be one of his favorite ties, a button down shirt, a sports jersey, recreational gear, or his uniform. Anything that makes the images more personal and sexy to him! It also adds variety to your collection of outfits and will look great in the final book.
Accessories
You can easily modify the look of your outfit by changing your accessories and moving to a new background. This is especially helpful during our marathons as time is a little more limited. Accessories include jewelry, scarves, hats, stilettos, boots, gloves, fishnets, stockings, garter belts, etc.
Bonus Clothing Tips
1. Most of our sessions include 2 outfits changes ( if time allowes) .
2. Bring your clothing and lingerie on hangers with a garment bag over the top. Don’t stuff it in a duffel! This will reduce wrinkles and fold lines.
3. Clean the bottoms of your shoes (and feet) just in case they appear in a photo.
4. Cut tags and make sure security devices have been removed from new purchases. We have scissors on hand if you forget.
5. Avoid skiing the week before your session! Small minor bruises from everyday activity are easy to remove in post-processing, but large bruises have to be hidden with your clothes.
6. The magic of photoshop stops at tan lines. Schedule your session before you go on a sunny summer vacation. If tan lines are unavoidable, bring clothing that will minimize or cover them.
7. You don’t need to bring 12 outfits to create a calendar. A few basic pieces, accessories, and then a couple outfits to match your favorite months of the year will be enough and we can continue in a relaxed pace.
8. Make sure your mani-pedi is fresh and matches your clothing colors and styles. French tips, golds, and neutral colors look really nice.
9. Opt for lacy, sheer demi cup bras over full coverage t-shirt bras.
10. Finally, come to the session in loose fitting clothes without bras, socks, or panties to prevent dents or lines on your body.
PLEASE DO NOT GO SPRAY TANNING BEFORE THE EVENT! YOUR PICTURES WILL NOT COME OUT CORRECTLY.  ALSO TAN LINES ARE A NIGHTMARE TO EDIT OUT SO PLEASE AVOID THEM. 
**PLEASE COME IN LOOSE CLOTHING TO AVOID MARKS ON YOUR SKIN IN YOUR PICTURES!

I can not wait to see all of you on January 7th and 8th! If you have not sent your DEPOSIT please contact me... all appointments that do not have a deposit by Dec 20 will be re opened for other people :), If you ask yourself why Photographers "charge so much" for shooting ... They don't get paid vacation, they don't get paid sick days, they don't get bonuses for outstanding performances nor for Christmas. They don't have insurance plans nor do they qualify for unemployment. They sacrifice their family on special days so that they can bring happiness to others. Illness or personal affairs are not excuses for a bad shooting or staying home. Next time you ask, remember that Photographers are Photographers because of the love of photography, but that love doesn't pay bills. Happy Photographer's Day!! Re-post if you're a Photographer or have good friends that are Photographers. RESPECT THE PHOTOGRAPHER!!!!!!!!, http://www.wix.com/mandagmail/boudoir-for-the-cure

http://photogamanda.weebly.com/, Family Photography Package 
Whether you’ve added a new bundle of joy to your family or want an up-to-date portrait of you closest loved ones,Amanda Stevens Photography can create a timeless keepsake you can treasure for a lifetime. No matter your family’s size or budget, we can work with you to develop a photography package that will 
allow you to capture this special time in your family’s life. 


Our Basic Family Portrait Photography Packages include the following: 

2 hours of set up and photography 

Up to 5 family members included for this package. Additional family members - add $20 per person. 

While we are there essentially to photograph the family group, if you choose we will also shoot any subgroup, individual portraits, portraits with pets etc. In fact anything that you might want. 

In the 2 hours we shoot approximately 100 images of the family in various groupings according to the clients wishes. 

We select the best 10 images and do a complete PhotoShop tweak session after the photography ends. (adjusting levels, sharpness, contrast, color saturation, conversion to B&W / sepia etc.) 

All original images, plus the "tweaked" images, are supplied to the client on CD. 

Reproduction Rights are assigned to the client allowing you to make your own reprints and enlargements at your own convenience. 

All of this for $250.00 (*$200.00 for facebook fans*)
