Chef Mark Porcaro

With more than two decades of experience in the restaurant industry, Chef Porcaro will make Town Market Andover a culinary destination.
In 2005, he received the Artistic Creativity Award at the Art Institute of Boston’s Edible Art Competition for his inventive recreation of the Asian fishing village depicted in Ando Hiroshige’s “Inlet at Awa Province.” His landscape, complete with live goldfish in a sparkling sea pool, featured mountains, pagodas and a shoreline fashioned out of lotus root, wheat grass, chocolate, sheet gelatin, graham cracker crumbs and royal icing.
Having assisted in planning and executing menus for numerous events at Manhattan’s prestigious James Beard House. Porcaro served as Executive Sous Chef at the luxuriant two hundred fifty-room Manele Bay Hotel in Lanai City, Hawaii. Prior to his work in Hawaii, Porcaro held culinary positions at Top of the Hub, Boston’s Le Meridien Hotel, The Lodge at Koele in Hawaii, Chatham Bars Inn in Cape Cod, the Regatta of Cotuit in Centerville, and the Royal Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge.

Pastry Chef Lee Napoli
Born in Virginia and raised in Pennsylvania, Lee worked in various restaurant capacities from server to bartender, from manager to caterer, and segued into the world of sweets as a pastry chef at Icarus, one of Boston's most legendary fine dining restaurants, in 1989.
Since then, Lee has worked at or consulted for countless top-rated restaurants in the city, including Maison Robert, Grill 23, Anago, Metro, Bricco, The Buttery and Sandrine's Bistro.
In the early 1990's, Lee established New England's first and only association for pastry professionals and still maintains an active role. She is also proud of having cooked at New York's James Beard House four times.
While winning cake awards, constructing gingerbread houses, and turning out thousands of perfect cookies, tarts, pies and pastries, Lee began making truffles in her downtime - sold without fanfare at a select few retail venues.

At the Loews Hotel Boston Rob was part of the opening team at Precinct Kitchen and Bar where he was also responsible for the beverage program for the hotel.
