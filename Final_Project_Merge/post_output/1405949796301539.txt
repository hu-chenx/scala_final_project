Johnny Fugitt visits 365 barbecue restaurants across 48 States in year and publishes 
The 100 Best Barbecue Restaurants in America book

Press Release
May 20, 2015
Arlington, Virginia
For Immediate Release

Blackstrap BBQ, Winthrop, Massachusetts, has been named one of the best barbecue restaurants in the country in The 100 Best Barbecue Restaurants in America book.
In one year, Johnny Fugitt visited 365 barbecue restaurants across 48 states.  The 100 Best Barbecue Restaurants in America blends travel writing, food writing and creative non-fiction to chronicle the journey, share secrets from barbecue kitchens and point the reader in the direction of America's best barbecue.
Fugitt visited a number of Boston-area barbecue restaurants, but Blackstrap BBQ was the only to make the Top 100.  He was most impressed with the wings, pulled pork and mustard sauce.
Unsatisfied with Top 10 lists that recycle the same historic or well-marketed restaurants, Fugitt hit the road in search of America's best.  Some of the expected barbecue names made the Top 100, but others are left off because, Fugitt argues, they survive on reputation alone and no longer produce great barbecue.  One famous barbecue restaurant is even criticized for microwaving ribs before service.
"My congratulations go to the whole team at Blackstrap BBQ," said Fugitt.  "After 365 barbecue restaurant visits in a year, they stood out as one of the best."
The book shares project methodology, includes insight into the practices of barbecue restaurants, provides commentary on current barbecue trends, tells stories of many colorful figures in barbecue, provides insider information to the best barbecue joints and ends with an awards section crowning a handful of restaurants with individual awards.
About the Author: Johnny Fugitt is a freelance writer from Missouri.  He holds a Master's Degree from the London School of Economics and is an officer in the United States Navy Reserve., New brew, Yay, Peach wood smoked lamb shank, carrot pur√©e, green tomato relish!!!

Nothing has happened yet.)

I will fight this fight for anyone who has been bullied or threatened by a corporation. Cintas who we had as our linen company for a few years has filed suit due to us leaving them. We tried to leave once and Cintas bullied us then with threats of suing us and we backed down and kept them. The second time we decided to leave we called Cintas multi times trying to talk to someone about the problems we had been having. We kept getting no response from them. We left Cintas because they kept charging us product we never received and for broken equipment that they would not come and fix after multiple calls had been made. I just wonder how many people Cintas has done this too? I can tell you this Cintas will not get one penny from me and Chris that's for sure!, How good does this look???

SWEET: CAF√â DU MONDE STYLE BEIGNETS, COFFEE GANACHE, Boston Strong!!!, (from kate) yesterday was one of the most moving, crazy unexpected days of my life. i woke up early and could not go on with my day without helping....helping out those in need from monday's tragic event. i knew there were so many people that wanted to help and i felt like i was doing this for all. so with an extremely heavy heart i decided to head for ground zero.... with the help of wendy from the winthrop chamber we were able to go to ground zero and hand out, pulled pork sandwiches, pizza, yogurt, beef sticks and water (thank you paul marks, paesans, nicks and blackstrap bbq of winthrop) to boston pd, fire, atf and fbi. when arrived we were greeted by boston police office griff. he had been working a triple and when i saw his eyes, i knew that we had done the right thing by coming. the police, fire, atf and fbi have worked countless hours to catch the criminal responsible for the devastation of monday's events. officer griff and the boston fire chief were kind enough to let us set up a spot behind an ambulance to distribute food. being tucked away behind the lines made it possible for these heroic people to grab some lunch and a drink. hearing the words of hope made me realize what a great country we live in. these men and women in uniform will stop at nothing until someone is brought to justice. i just wanted to share with you how just doing so little can help so much... any act of kindness can go a long way. donate blood, give $5 to one of the families, drop off cookies, say thank you to a person in uniform (they are just as upset as you are). and most of all hug your loved ones., Come down and get a homemade hot pocket!!!!!, Hog muffins for sale!!!!, Buffalo chicken and blue cheese HOMEMADE Hot Pockets!!!!!!!!

OK...(this is kate) So early today the owner of the Golden Banana (strip clud for all of you living under a rock) calls me to ask me if I wanted to advertise at GB. Being the sweet gal that I am, I asked him to email me the details...eventhough I had no interest. (nothing against strippers, but Blackstrap is a family place...I think:) Then he tells me he was kidding and the only reason he asked me was because he has been finding Blackstrap Stickers on his stripper poles. I nearly died laughing! So I said the next time you are in the area come by and I will buy you some lunch! Part 2: Chris (my business partner) then calls me and I kind of lied to him and told him that the Danvers PD just stopped by to tell us that the GB wants to press charges because of the stripper poles being vandalized. Normally Chris is quick to smell a lie, but this was SO out of the park he bought it! I went on telling him that the fines started at $500 dollars and we would have to go to court, I have all the paperwork here to look at...etc! Two hours goes by and he calls me all mad, saying that this is total bs and that he is going to call the GB guy...blah, blah, blah. I hang up and my husband calls him, who goes along with the entire story. Finally 1ish Chris walks thru the door....Ok where is the paperwork, this is crazy...all in a huff! Then he tells me he just talked to out lawyer and that the GB guy does not have a case...In tears I turn around and tell him "just kidding"....The look on his face=priceless. God I love today:), http://www.boston.com/bestofthenew
