Murder Point Oysters-for the first time in New England

Murder Point
Portersville Bay, Alabama

The only oyster on the Gulf Coast tumbled using the Australian longline system (the bags are hooked onto longlines so they flop around in the tides). The result is an unusually deep, smooth, and colorful shell, coupled with the Gulf Coast’s typically extra-plump meat. Raised just off Murder Point, whose name derives from some bad mojo between wild oyster harvesters long ago.

Species: Eastern
Cultivation: Semi-tumbled
Salinity: Moderate
Size: Average
Region: Gulf of Mexico

Island Creek Oysters
WHY THEIR UNIQUE: Duxbury Bay has drastic eleven foot tides, which means eleven feet of water leave our bay twice a day. It’s insane! Consequently, the water here rarely reaches 70 degrees so our oysters never spawn, making them meaty and flavorful all year long. It also means that the bay is full of new, cold, algae filled water which is, quite literally, ideal for hungry oysters. 
Sizes Regulars (3”) and Selects (2”)

Peter's Point Oysters
WHY THEIR UNIQUE: Small and deep cupped, Peter’s have round shells with an unmistakable dark greenish tint. They are grown in the Cape Cod canal which has a huge influx of water containing massive amounts of algae that is apparent both inside and outside the oyster.
Sizes Selects (1.75”), Remember to follow us on Twitter too:

Brasserie 28 and Heady Topper Collaboration at the ‘GBH Food & Wine Gala. 

Pairing beers with food can be as easy as a hotdog and a cold pilsner, but what to do when the brew in question is little more assertive, like the award-winning, limited-production, best-ranked-double-IPA-of-all-time*, Heady Topper? Call in the professionals. On Thursday, September 11th at this year’s Taste of WGBH Food & Wine Festival Gala, two revered industry veterans (and old friends), chef Matt Morello of Brasserie 28 and Jen Kimmich of The Alchemist Brewery, reunite to incorporate the bright, citrusy notes of Heady Topper into an array of dishes that showcase the versatility and complexity that’s earned this beer such a cult following.

The Brasserie 28/Alchemist match up might seem a little out of left field; where’s the overlap between an Andover brasserie and a Vermont brewery? Beacon Hill, it turns out. Morello and Kimmich worked together at The Federalist at XV Beacon, planning an endless array of events and countless wine dinners. “I’ve known Jen since before she and her husband, John, started the brewery,” says Morello. Their rapport has set the stage for a collaboration that is going to yield a variety of dishes accented by the unique flavors of what some say is the greatest double IPA in existence.

"You want to give the beer respect,” Morello says. “Pairing food with an IPA like Heady Topper can be a challenge. It has such an incredible flavor profile and there are so many interesting possibilities.” With the help of chef Michael Sherman, Morello has planned some thoughtful dishes that incorporate Heady Topper from top to bottom. They’ll be adding Heady Topper to their pistachio-studded mortadella, made with Vermont-sourced beef; the rustic cheese that accompanies it, Cheddy Topper, uses Heady Topper in the cheese-making process; even the crostini they’ll be using is made with a malt flour that’s a byproduct of the Heady Topper brewing process. And that’s just the beginning – there’ll be Heady Topper-braised pork, Heady Topper mustard and Heady Topper sauerkraut.

Let the oenophiles do their thing – it’s the Food & Wine festival, after all – but if you want to see what all the Heady Topper fuss is about, head for the Brasserie 28 table as soon as you get there. If the lines to purchase cases of beer at The Alchemist Brewery are any indication, best to make it the evening’s first stop. The doors open at 7:00pm and tickets are available online. Get hopping.
