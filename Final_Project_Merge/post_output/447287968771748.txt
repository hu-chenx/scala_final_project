Allow me to begin by expressing my gratitude to you for your patronage of Donohue’s Bar and Grill. In these difficult economic times, your support and loyalty means more than words can express. As a business owner, home owner and parent, I know all too well the challenges that owning a local business can present. 

You may recall that in June 2011, Donohue’s Bar and Grill was approved for an outdoor seating area, which was not only welcome but enjoyed by all.   As a business owner, I continue to strive to find ways to enhance the business both financially and for the good of my patrons.  After researching more on outdoor seating and all it entails, I found that our local licensing board improperly restricted the hours of the outdoor seating area which goes against what the State Statue allows for.  Since I believe it may have been an oversight, I have applied to correct their original ruling. 

This evening at 7PM, I will go before the board to ask their consideration to remedy this. However, I have been advised that Councilor Angeline Kounelis – District A Councilor is actively seeking opposition and is asking residents to voice their opposition.  I cannot speak as to why Councilor Kounelis is so vehemently opposed to a business owner who is simply trying to make a living.  

To this end, I am humbly asking you for your support.  If you can please attend the meeting this evening to show your support of a local business owner, I would be grateful. I am not asking you to speak on my behalf, but rather just to come and show your support.  

The meeting begins at 7PM and will be held in the Lower Hearing Room at the Town Hall.

Thank you – please be in touch if you have any questions.
