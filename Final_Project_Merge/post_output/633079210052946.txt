List(A quick update, since we haven't posted anything in a while:

We were very close to signing a lease on a location in Davis Square, but ultimately the full investment to open a restaurant in the specific space we were looking at was just a little more than we could afford.  We've taken a step back, are trying to get all of our ducks in a row (including lining up all potential investors), and will begin our location search anew when we feel we're ready to jump at any opportunities.

We still hope to make this happen, so keep following us for future updates., Happy New Year!  We're honored to be included in boston.about.com's 2014 Year in Review, specifically in its mention of "iconic" restaurants that closed during the year.  While Veggie Planet closed in 2014, we're hoping that 2015 will be the year that it reopens!  Continue to follow this page for updates, and here's wishing you all a wonderful new year., Just wanted to post a quick update.  First, thanks so much for all of your interest and comments.  Thanks as well to all of you who participated in our location survey. Close to 1,300 of you gave us your thoughts on where you'd like to see a new Veggie Planet.  With the advantage of an already loyal customer base, Harvard Square came out on top, with Davis Square a close second and Porter Square taking home the bronze.

While we'd love to end up in one of those spots, finding the right location involves many factors, not all of which are under our control.  So, long story short, all options are still on the table.

We've begun reaching out to potential landlords, and are hopeful that the right location will turn up soon.  Keep checking back here for updates.

We miss you!, Hello! Hopefully you haven't forgotten about us. We certainly haven't forgotten about you!

We have potentially great news - we've found a former customer who is very serious about opening Veggie Planet in another location.  The big question is: where should that location be?  Help us decide by going to this link and telling us where you'd most like to see Veggie Planet resurrected.  

Thanks so much., As I spend the day today clearing out the remnants of Veggie Planet, there's not much time to reflect yet on the past thirteen years.  True reflection will come later.  Suffice it to say, however, that I am truly grateful for all that Veggie Planet's wonderful customers and staff have given to me over the years.  Through all the ups and downs, it has always been the wonderful people who made it most worthwhile.  You are what and who I will miss the most, and I thank you for all the great memories.

It has been so nice to hear over the past few months the degree to which many of you will miss Veggie Planet as well.  It is for this reason that I remain determined to help resurrect Veggie Planet in a different location, albeit under different ownership.  Though there are no guarantees, that is the ultimate goal.

While I have decided that the bulk of my energy and attention is best focused on Veggie Galaxy at this point, I do look forward to the day when I can return to Veggie Planet as a customer.  I suspect that I will feel in part as a parent does when visiting a grown, independent, child who has moved away and made a life for him or herself.   I will remain grateful for the time that I had and so proud of the life that continues without me.

In the meantime, any developments regarding Veggie Planet's future will be posted here, so please continue to follow us for updates.  Anyone who would like to play a role in helping Veggie Planet to continue its journey can email me at adamveggieplanet@gmail.com. 

Thank you again.  It's been an amazing ride., Thank you for your enthusiasm and support today!
Although we were ready for a crowd we have run out of just about everything at this point and have to stop serving.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

www.veggieplanet.net, Ali; Server and Musician, with our LAST brunch waffle. August 17, 2014.

www.veggieplanet.net, Final day.  No words (or pictures), except Love you all., More of our wonderful staff. These photos are from the past couple of years., Our last Special Pizza is a tribute to a special Veggie Planet customer named Barry, who has eaten here probably an average of 6x/week (often 7x/week) for years. We'll miss being a part of his life as we'll miss being a part of yours.  
We know that Barry loves seitan, so Chef Chelsea designed this last special pizza with that in mind:

UPSIDE-DOWN POT PIE PIZZA: House-made Seitan, Potatoes, Peas, Carrots, Gravy, Scallions, all on our flatbread pizza(also available on Brown or Coconut Rice...but then it's not an upside down pot pie!).  Note: the gravy is NOT gluten free  #seitan #vegan

www.veggieplanet.net, Here's how we're eating our way through all our favorite Veggie Planet pizzas and salads this week:  the lunch "Small Pizza with Salad Combo". 
Shown is the Mexican Bean pizza with the Caesar Salad, but you can combine any pizza and any salad. Hope you'll get to have your favorites one more time!

www.veggieplanet.net, Many thanks to Rachel Blumenthal (@blumie) for writing this for Eater Boston and tweeting it today with this lead-in: 
"It's time to get in your final meals at @VeggiePlanetMA. This Sunday, August 17, is the last day for the restaurant."

Overheard today in the VP lunch line "Oh the pressure! My last visit ever to Veggie Planet - - what to order???". , Veggie Planet has been so fortunate to have had an amazing parade of bright, creative and fun staff over the years. Many were talented musicians, artists, writers and dancers, and working at Veggie Planet helped them pay the rent. Here are some of the photos we found of staff during Veggie Planet's early years. 
If anyone has other VP photos that they'd like to share, we would love to see them and add them to this album. Email them to kathyveggieplanet@gmail.com or adamveggieplanet@email.com. Thank you!, Wondering how many Onions, Butternut Squash, Broccoli and Tomatoes we've prepped since 2001...?

www.veggieplanet.net, Some amazing street art!, Caesar Salad on a Big Cheesy Crouton!  

We're still here and serving all your VP favorites as usual today and through the summer.  Wonder how many people would say this is their favorite Veggie Planet meal?

Have a good week.

www.veggieplanet.net, Looks like the word is out, so we want to provide some facts.

It‚Äôs very sad, but true; Veggie Planet will not exist in its current location beyond the end of August (OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE AS NORMAL UNTIL THEN!).

Since Club Passim‚Äôs  seating capacity was reduced in late 2011 due to fire code enforcement, and given that there is no table turnover in their concert room every night, it has become unsustainable to continue to operate Veggie Planet in this space.  

We hope that it will live on in a new location - - hopefully right in Harvard Square where there is such a great community of regular customers.  Some of these folks eat here nearly every day of the week, and for that we've been incredibly grateful. 
 
Given that we also operate Veggie Galaxy, however, we feel that our attention is better focused on Galaxy than on the time and energy it would take to transfer Veggie Planet's operations to an alternative location.  Therefore, we sincerely hope that potential new owners will come forward to operate Veggie Planet in a new space.

Interested, or know somebody who might be?  Email Adam at adamveggieplanet@gmail.com, Two yummy Brunch Specials today!  Serving BRUNCH now, from 11:00 - 3:00 today.  Come on down!

www.veggieplanet.net, If you've been to Veggie Planet recently you may have felt eyes following you as you walked down the steps to the restaurant...
Someone has vandalized our Veggie Planet tent sign at the top of the steps by sticking two "googly eyes" on the tomato logo.

We're definitely not in favor of vandalism (it happens so much in Harvard Square and costs all of us merchants real money to deal with it), but we have to say this is kind of cute. :-), It's a white sky in Cambridge, MA this morning and the snow is coming down fast.
Duck into our cozy subterranean space for some Hot Chocolate, Equal Exchange Coffee, MEM Tea or Soup.  It's easier to appreciate the beauty of the snow when you're toasty warm!

The pizza/rice dish, debuting today, has Tempeh Sausage, Roasted Red Peppers, Fennel-Leek Sauce, PORTABELLA MUSHROOMS, Mozzarella and Asiago cheese (can substitute Daiya or our own basil-tofu mash). Sounds a little like early Fall, right?

But wait, is it "Portabella" mushrooms or "Portobello" mushrooms? In looking it up we learned a) that Portobello mushrooms were possibly named after London's Portobello Road, which is home to upscale shops, restaurants and a market, and b) that although both spellings are correctly used, "...the Mushroom Council has adopted the two "a" version to establish some consistency". 

We're using the Mushroom-Council-approved spelling so we don't mess with consistency. But either way, we can assure you that it tastes GREAT!, Our hydrangeas are in full bloom and looking amazing!

Ah, the ghost of our old pizza oven is in the house.  Our new pizza oven is currently out of order and being serviced.  The good news is that it's a very specific problem that, once fixed, should not happen again. The bad news is that the service company has stuff sprawled about our kitchen so we can't open until they're done.

Is there a ghostbuster nearby?

Veggie Planet has been nominated for Best Veggie Restaurant (as has our sister restaurant Veggie Galaxy), as well as for BEST PIZZA!  Not sure how much longer the voting lasts, so please, please, vote now!  IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE IF WE WON BEST PIZZA!  PLEASE VOTE!

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dHpjS3JsZGNQNXdSUmlYQ180VENzcWc6MA, The results for the new pizza voting are in!  

Barbecued Tofu Pizza: 47%
Tapenade Pesto Pizza: 39%
Hummus Pizza: 13%

Given that a) the Barbecued Tofu won with a plurality rather than a clear majority, b) the other two pizzas received significant support (yes, even 13% is significant), and c) there was some controversy involving hanging chads, WE'VE DECIDED TO ADD ALL 3 PIZZAS TO THE MENU!

Stay tuned for further announcements on when this addition will officially go into effect.  Winners of the raffle will also be announced shortly., Happy Halloween!

Cake (vegan!): orange almond, WE'RE OPENING!  We've passed all inspections and are prepping our entire menu as we speak.  We'll be opening for dinner tonight at 6PM.  Let's consider that a soft reeopening, with our grand reopening tomorrow at our normal time (regular hours 11:30AM-10:30PM).

Thanks so much for all of your patience, and we'll see you soon!, Fire Update (Day 17):
The fire-rated panel mentioned in the last update has been taken care of.  A call has been made to the inspectors to come back and take a look, but that call has not been returned yet.  Barring any other surprises, the only things left to do are get the inspectors out here, get their blessing, and then get NSTAR out here to turn the gas back on.  Given that we haven't heard back from the inspectors yet, it seems unlikely we'll be able to get NSTAR out here today... so, assuming inspections and NSTAR happen tomorrow, we'll plan to prep through the Tuesday night if we have to to be open on Wednesday.  Fingers crossed!, Fire Update (Day 14):
Sadly, it looks like National Veggie Planet day will have to wait a little longer.  Inspectors came in this morning and discovered a theretofore undiscovered open vertical passageway to the left of our exhaust hood that we're now told needs to be covered with a fire-rated panel.  We'll try to take care of that as quickly as possible, but it will definitely add some time to our scheduled reopening.  Once again, stay tuned., Fire Update (Day 12):

Roof duct work repair is now complete!  Access panels for exhaust duct are now installed!  Just a little more clean-up today and tomorrow, and then inspectors will arrive on Thursday.  Assuming we pass inspection, we'll then prep all day Thursday and shoot for being open on Friday!  If that's the case, our friend Willa d'Cat has suggested that this Friday be National Veggie Planet day!  Check back here Thursday late morning for word on our inspection, and then spread the word!, Fire Update (Day 7):
Still on for the roof duct work to be repaired on Thursday, but now we're also being required to install an access panel to the duct on the interior of the building.  Makes sense for better cleaning and safer exhaust, so we're happy to do it... but best case scenario for opening seems to have moved again.  We're looking into next week now.  Keep checking back!, Fire Update (Day 6):
The duct work is now scheduled to be repaired this Thursday.  We've still got some other electrical issues going on that we hope can be cleared up by that time as well, followed by fire, building & health inspections.  Best case scenario seems to have changed from Wednesday to Friday.  So, so, sorry!, Fire Update (Day 5):
Since we're just coming off the weekend, nothing has really changed since our last update.  Still hoping to get the duct work repaired by tomorrow and then have the proper inspections to be able to open on Wednesday.  That's the best case scenario., Fire Update (Day 3):
The main thing that we still need to do is repair the duct work on the roof (the firemen had to break into it to put out the fire).  Unfortunately, repairs probably won't happen until Tuesday at the earliest, at which point we'll then have to be reinspected, which may or may not happen on the same day as the repairs.  So right now, realistically, we're shooting for Wednesday reopening.  Fingers crossed., Fire Update:
Still trying to pick up all the pieces (do all the needed cleaning, make all the needed repairs, arrange all the needed inspections, deal with all the needed insurance paperwork, etc., etc.).  Right now, it's looking like middle of next week at best for reopening.  Check back here for updates., Bad news... we had a serious fire in our hood system today, will require repair work, reinspection, etc., etc.  We're closed until further notice (at least a few days, probably more).  This is one of those times when we can honestly say this hurts us more than it hurts you.  Still, thank you so much for your patience, first with our pizza oven and now with this.  You're the best!, Quick reminder that Veggie Planet will be closed tomorrow for the 4th, but Veggie Galaxy will be open all day (including during our usual 3-5PM midday hiatus)., Making July 4th plans?  Just letting you know that Veggie Planet will be closed on the 4th, but our sister restaurant, Veggie Galaxy, will be open all day.  So stop in while heading down Mass Ave towards the fireworks!

We open at 11:30AM if you want to be the first person to have pizza from our new oven., The exhaust system is fixed, but we weren't able to get an inspector here today.  We're at the mercy of the inspector at this point.  When we start making pizza again depends on when we can get the inspector here to give us the thumbs up.  So close, we can taste it!, Oh so close on the pizza oven!  Final connections were made today, but our exhaust system broke down... getting that fixed today, hoping to have inspector in tomorrow to approve the oven hook-up and then we should be good to go!

He feels very sad that he can't help., Very bad news!  Our pizza oven is done.  The professionals are telling us we shouldn't put any more money into it, which means we need to research new pizza ovens that fit our space and our budget - could take some time.

This time the menu will be at the whim of Chef Patti Bugge.  All produce will be coming in directly from local farms.  Are we looking at Summer Squash Soup, Stuffed Squash Blossoms and Caponata?  Will the long awaited coconut ice cream show up on this dinner's final menu?
Four courses, all vegan, with housemade soda to boot! Only $25.
Email reservations to Adam@veggieplanet.net, Well, it could have been worse.  We were able to have a replacement part overnighted to us and installed today, so we're back in business... pizza is once again on the menu., It's been a nice long stretch, but all good things must come to an end (is that really true?)... Our pizza oven is down after an unusually long time without problems, so all of our pizza/rice entrees are currently available only over rice.  Ah, just in time for the two sold-out shows at Club Passim tonight.

We have someone coming to look at the oven today and will keep you posted.

Wish us luck!, Check out this cool new, award-winning (yes, award-winning at a Harvard film festival!) video by Rob Cohen, filmed right here at Veggie Planet/ Passim!
