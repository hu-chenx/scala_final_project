"Bistro du Midi, Best for: French-Styled Fruits de Mer

There’s something to be said for a beautifully plated, perfectly cooked piece of fish—be it crisp-skinned hake atop lobster consommé, or roasted monkfish with au poivre sauce. Here that fish is crafted by a chef with a Le Bernardin pedigree and served in an airy, elegant dining room complete with cushy chairs and attentive servers who can guide you to a glass of rosé from the extensive list. Lovely an evening as it sounds, it’s an increasingly rare treat in the shared-plates, no-reservations, industrial-chic dining world we now inhabit—so make the most of it."
