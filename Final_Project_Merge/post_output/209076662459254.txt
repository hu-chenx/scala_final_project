GENERAL
We packaged 550 cases of Artaic yesterday plus some draft for growler fills. We split that amount between our two locations. Given the chatter we are seeing on the net, doesn't look like any is going to make it out to accounts this time around. We'll likely make two batches for the next release so we can get some out to  the draft and bottle shop accounts who support us!

Bottles only (all available beers) for special early hours 10a-noon
Limit 12 bottles/128 growler fills for all beers, including Artaic
***We may drop limits lower on Artaic if there is a substantial turnout***

How long will Artaic last?
This batch is 3x the size of the biggest batches we released previously, but now we have two locations. Its impossible for us to know! Stay tuned for updates on availability as we go, we'll post updates here/twitter/insta as often as we can...but we can't respond to specific requests about if it'll be available at any one time. There are a couple of really good FB fan pages that will post much more detailed, crowd sourced info that we ever could possibly supply ourselves. Check those out in addition to what we post...but know that the only 'official' information comes from us!

Located in Boston’s up-and-coming Fort Point hood, Trillium is one of only a handful of production breweries in the city (two of the others, whose names you might recognize, are Harpoon and Samuel Adams). Trillium offers four signature beers: Wakerobin, a farmhouse rye red ale; Pot&Kettle, an oatmeal stout; Fort Point Pale Ale; and the brewery’s signature Trillium, a barley and wheat farmhouse ale. There’s also a list of rotating seasonal beers, like their first bottled brew, the barrel-aged Pot&Kettle porter, offered with a two-bottle max limit.

What’s the most unlikely place for a farmhouse brewery? How about in downtown Boston’s Fort Point, one of the neighborhoods leading the charge right now in urban gentrification. After two years of building, renovating, permitting, and negotiating the morass of city and state licensing, the team at Trillium was finally able to get off the ground, and they’ve taken off like a rocket! While they’ve dropped more than their fair share of killer beers in 2013, we’ve got to give a nod to the flagship saison. It’s peppery, easy to drink and tastes like you’re stepping back into Belgium. The fact that you can only get it by the growler (or few select tap locations) is great, because it means you need to share with a friend. Look for them to keep expanding in 2014., http://t.co/0s2bKFILl1, sorry for the lines everyone...once inside, samples to the left, growler fills to the right) should have plenty of FPPA thru tonight!, http://t.co/XDcGit2HeI, Everyone stop by@grandten before/after visiting Trillium MT "Happy heat wave Boston!

Our Wakerobin red rye farmhouse ale was aged in almond liqueur casks from Grand Ten Distilling for 3 months. This beer is only available right from the brewery and there's a 2 bottle (375ml) per person limit to help ensure more people get a chance to try it.

Tucked away in an alley in industrial Fort Point, Trillium Brewing Company produces innovative beers in small batches. They’ve just begun small bottling runs, but the best way to take home brews with names like Wakerobin and Pot & Kettle is to fill up a growler at the brewery. If you’re having trouble deciding among the options, the deliciously dry-hopped Fort Point Pale Ale is a standout.
