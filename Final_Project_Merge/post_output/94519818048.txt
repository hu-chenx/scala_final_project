We recovered 61 electrical spools (ranging from 24" to 86" in diameter) that were littering a field behind a local electrical supply warehouse and were eventually going to be discarded to a landfill. 

We broke down the spools, cleaned, sanded and dried the end pieces, cut them to our desired size and shape, torched them to bring out the grain and finally sealed them with a clear coat. The entire process took 3 months to complete. We even used these handcrafted table tops for the signs in our dining room and above our door by having them laser engraved with our logo.

The photos below (clockwise from the top left) follow the table tops during this process., Looking for a career opportunity? DECCA is hiring!!! Please apply by sending an email to jobs@deccaboston.com, With a glorious weather forecast, our outdoor seating area would be a great place to enjoy a delicious lunch at DECCA, The USS Constitution is open for public visitation !!! Come Visit Old Ironsides in Dry Dock and grab a delicious lunch at DECCA, Thanks to @UrbanDaddy for this article!
