"Vinny,
You made a great day even better...Cavalia topped off by a fantastic meal. You do make the best "sauce/gravy" around. Rhode Island restaurants and even your own North End have nothing on you. Your hospitality exceeded our expectations. Your wait staff and bar person made our visit to your place that much more fun. "Food blessed by the angels". Hope to see you again real soon.

Thanks again and God Bless You.
Karen, Bob & Sydney"

That parmesan cheese you find on some restaurants tables isn't true parmesan. Here at Vinny's we pride ourselves at providing the best ingredients for you. Some places provide mass market parmesan cheese which contain preservatives and other chemicals to lengthen their lives. We hand grate our parmesan reggiano just for you. We go out of our way to find the best true parmesan reggiano wheels to perfectly accompany your meal. We take the time to do it right. It means alot to us because you mean alot to us. Next time you visit, look down at the cheese and know, we do it because we care., Photo's of Vinny's taken by a fan who wrote such a nice blog post about Vinny's. https://www.facebook.com/BunnyandPorkBelly is her FB page.
