Singer-Songwriter, Actress and Dancer, Ariana Corradi was born in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2011, she decided to move to Boston in order to focus her studies in Music at Berklee College of Music where she is majoring in Performance and Songwriting and pursuing a minor in Drama. This experience has helped her combine all her previous studies into an integral one.
As part of a dynamic Jazz duet, she was able to perform in multiple arenas such as in bars, weddings, art galleries and other artistic venues. In addition she was part of several casts performing Musical Theatre in Buenos Aires and in Boston. Now she forms part of the Lexington Players, where she develops the character of Ilse in the popular Show Spring Awakening.
Ariana also performs some of her original songs in Berklee venues such as Berk Hall and David Friend.
She is currently studying ukelele and piano, and will start cello classes which will help her develop a better orchestral sense of music.
Her desire to teach is deeply rooted in her strong connection to music. She believes that teaching is the best way to help and transmit the knowledge that one has to others, and for a performer, there is no better gratification than teaching the knowledge we acquire to others, which is also a great way to learn and remember how the process of singing works.
She is Excited about performing for the Boston community, a sensitive audience moved by music and art., Please don't forget about our Wine Mixer tomorrow night from 6pm-10pm at the Venezia on the deck overlooking the Boston Harbor featuring the Oysters of East Dennis Oyster Farms and Boston Winery Wines.

Our hopes are to make learning about wine fun, and useful.  Every week we will be conducting our version of Wine 101.  Every week we will present a new aspect of wine and how it relates to the nuts and bolts of the grape so you can then construct your own tourbillion to Bacchus.  This way if you cannot make a class it's not an issue, and if you attend regularly it won't be redundant.
Classes will be every Tuesday 6:30pm-8:30pm, we will provide a wine flight, pizza, cheese crackers, and a tour of the winery.  In addition, wines will be available by the glass following the class., null)
