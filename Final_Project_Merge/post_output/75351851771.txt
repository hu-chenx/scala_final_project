"It's been an exciting fall in the world of food waste. In September, both the Obama Administration and the United Nations adopted ambitious targets to cut food waste in half by 2030. Last Friday, the G20 launched a Technical Platform to aid in the effort. And now, the Food Recovery Act goes beyond commitments to offer specific actions and policies that the U.S. can adopt now to significantly cut back on the amount of food wasted."

"The tragedy is that some farmers can't sell half of what they've grown due to cosmetic standards dictated by supermarkets...And supermarkets regularly cancel or change orders at the last minute, meaning that food already produced by their suppliers gets dumped. Farmers bear the cost of this waste, though it's not their fault...Governments should intervene when powerful retailers cancel orders, and dump their food waste on farmers, refusing to pay the bill."

Feedback, "But perhaps the more important lesson to learn is that we will always be on the losing side in the war against waste as long as we allow supermarkets to lord it over our food chain. Waste, whether by best-before date, by the imposition of ludicrous cosmetic specifications, or unnecessary packaging, is hardwired into the supermarket system. Until we stop deferring to supermarketsâ€™ own advice on what we may eat and when, those bins will keep filling up."

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/04/supermarkets-use-by-dates-food-waste, Sobering food waste facts from last night's Disco Soup: Boston

"How much of the world's agricultural land is used to grow food that goes to waste?

28%

A staggering 28% of the world's agricultural land - an area larger than Canada - is used to grow food that never gets eaten. What's worse, if food waste were a country, it would have the world's third-largest greenhouse gas footprint after the U.S. and China. Thankfully, this is a problem we can all help solve!"

"How much of America's wasted food would feed all 49 million Americans who don't have a steady supply of food on their tables?

One third - it's so bad that reducing our food waste by just a third would do it.

Reducing America's food waste by even one third would save enough food to satisfy the needs of all 50 million food-insecure Americans. We actually produce enough food to feed all 842 million people living with chronic hunger around the world today. Reducing waste represents a huge opportunity to put an end to this problem.", Spotted in a nytimes travel video about Buenos Aires, YAY we're cooking again for HONK! this year!

May The Gleaners' Kitchen live on, and may it do so because we all work together to make it happen.
