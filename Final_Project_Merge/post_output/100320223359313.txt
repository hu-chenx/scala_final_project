List(Welcome back to #truckerTuesdays! This week we're featuring one of our most beloved truckers, Eve. In 2014, at only 17, Eve took a chance and moved to Boston from her home town of Baltimore. She found her way to Bon Me a year ago and has found her happy place taking orders at our Harvard truck ever since. Soon she's making another big move, TO BOULDER, COLORADO, and we're going to have to say goodbye to one of our favorite faces of Bon Me :( SO stop by Harvard and catch her while she's still here!, It's pouring today but that's okay.

She's a manager, she runs lunch services, and is an all around saving grace at our commissary every day, where food truck life is at its most hectic. On top of all that, she (somehow) fits in time to work with a dance/theater company named Paradise Lost. If you see her on a truck make sure to say Hello!, WE LOVE #GREENS! You? ;) Happy St Patrick's Day! Our new #matchagreentea shortbread cookies're warm & ready! Available at all our trucks and restaurants. See you soon?

Rice paper wrapped tofu, rice noodle, carrots, mesclun. #summerfeeling #healthyfood, OK we like it. But, do you know the story? 

This ‚Äúnot so traditional‚Äù Banh Mi sandwich is a product of two great cuisines living together: the Vietnamese and French gastronomies. In the late 19th century, French colonies brought the baguette and their Parisian style sandwich with P√¢t√© in Indochina. The Vietnamese adapted it with native Vietnamese ingredients, such as cilantro, cucumber, and pickled carrots and daikon. 
At Bon Me, we decided to keep it that simple: tasty, fresh and with housemade spicy mayo and pork pate. Now, let's just pick a filling and bon app√©tit!, Happy New Year!!!!!!!!! - The Bon Me Crew, null, First snow of the season! #letsthegamebegin, Share your love for our NoodleSalad & B√°nhm√¨ sandwich!

... and seeing noodles everywhere.  It was no surprise then, that when the Bon Me crew heard about the multi-city improv prank, No Pants Subway Ride, the first thing we thought was... OMG noodles!  

Noodles‚Ä¶ noodles‚Ä¶ do you see what we‚Äôre saying? (That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre actually sayin‚Ä¶!)  We decided to join in the fun, and bring along some Noodle Stop signs. 

If you've never heard of it before, No Pants Subway Ride is an annually recurring prank in cities all over the nation, where hundreds of people join together to ride the subway... with no pants on. You read that right. Zero pants. 

The event was organized by BostonSOS, and our role as pantsless subway riders was to not let the unsuspecting riders in on the game by coming up with a unique reason as to why we weren't wearing pants. 

Our crew ventured out with a great excuse‚Äì we left our pants at work! 

Along the way, we made cool friends who wanted to join us in noodle-y mission: unite the city over fun events, and fun food, and fun people!

Just another note that we're closed today and tomorrow.  The city informed us on Tuesday that we would be unable to vend in our Clarendon spot for this weekend due to Marathon preparations.  They also said the Stuart St. location would be difficult to access.  They offered us some other options, but we've always been focused on trying to make our regular spots, and we decided to be closed for the weekend and use the time to get our new truck ready.  The whole situation is really disappointing, but we understand that they have a lot of work to do to prepare the Copley area for the race.

We're sorry for everyone who came out to our spots expecting to find us this weekend.  We've done our best to let people know via our Twitter.  In general, please check our Twitter for updates.
