http://bit.ly/1iVUCfh, "They can try to sink us, but I'll just swim." #CANNONBALL ft. X Ambassadors 9/25, In loving memory of Kyle Flanner 

Kyle started doing my hair when I was a young teen in Madison, WI. The first time I met him, I remember noticing he had that star quality many celebrities have. It's a vibrance that's hard to explain, but it steals the attention in any room, and it is addicting. I was always intrigued and entertained in the salon chair. After my sister started getting her hair done by him as well, he soon graduated from being our hair dresser to being our friend, then from friend to chosen family. One of the things that bonded us was that we all shared a deep love of music. I remember having long discussions about Jeff Buckley, Elliot Smith, and Kurt Cobain... Kyle had a soft spot for raw, authentic, soulful music, and he was never afraid to tell me his honest opinion of my work even when it stung. I am sad he won't hear my new album... I think he would have finally been impressed ;-) That's what I liked about him. He didn't kiss my ass. This quality carried over into his opinions of my boyfriends and such as well :-). But he had a way of expressing these opinions in such a kind and caring manner, he made me feel special, even when he criticized. 

But man, did we ever have some fun times together in Wisconsin, Chicago, and LA! Over the years, we each had our own major life changes that slowly pulled us apart, but the few times we were able to reunite, it felt like no time had passed. I'll miss his random, out of the blue phone calls...he was never too busy to hit up a friend just to check in...but I was. The loss of Kyle has taught me a valuable lesson... We are never too busy for our loved ones, we only think we are sometimes. It's always worth picking up the phone, even if just to say, "Sorry I can't talk right now, but I love you." 

Kyle lived with great passion. He felt everything so deeply, which was his beauty, and his curse. I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to know him. He will be sorely missed, and always loved.

I know there are people who follow me on Facebook who also knew Kyle... If you would like to do something to help support his family in this difficult time, here is a link where you can donate to help pay for the funeral costs.

I thought summer was coming, but then it snowed. @nataliewall and I were on top of Main Street in Park city, and she had one shot in the Polaroid.

Watch here: http://bit.ly/UnHfDb, To my dear fans-

First of all, congratulations on surviving the apocalypse, and the holidays!  Happy 2013!

As I start an exciting new chapter in my career, I wanted to take a moment to give thanks.  For those of you who have been following me for years, I thank you for sticking with me through thick and thin, and for understanding and accepting all of the changes I have gone through. Making music is constantly a process of self-discovery, and I thank you for coming along on my journey.

For those of you who are new fans, thanks for checking out my music and welcome aboard!

2013 is going to be a special year for us.  For the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to work with so many amazing people, which allowed me to experiment until I could figure out exactly what I wanted my album to sound like. Well, I finally figured it out, and I can’t wait to share it with you.

C’mon Let Me Ride is just the tip of the iceberg of what’s on the album…there is so much more below the surface, and I’ve never in my life been so excited to share something I’ve created with the world. This album is the most “me” I’ve ever allowed myself to be…from the darkness, to the sense of humor and the attitude, from the stories in the lyrics, to the way I use my voice.  I even went back to my natural dirty blonde hair color, and my rural tomboy attire, or as I like to call it “axe murderer chic.”  This is who I am, like it or not.  As many of my favorite albums have inspired and helped me, my biggest hope is that “Don’t Look Down” will do the same for you.  I hope that you may be inspired to embrace your own individuality as well, and follow your heart no matter what anyone else thinks. Why feel invisible when you can glow in the dark?

We will be seeing each other A LOT in the new year! Wishing you all the most success and happiness! Cheers to new beginnings! I love you all!

Your favorite f*cking flower,
