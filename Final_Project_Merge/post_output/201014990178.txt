I've had Bone Daddy's 5 times now and I am truly a fan. The folks that work this truck are fun and entertaining. Hipsters? Maybe just a bit, but the good kind...trust. Any food truck that plays Iron Maiden while waiting for my order is a truck that I love. Twice now I've had the LEMMY (clearly no Motorhead fans on Yelp) and it as fantastic!The fries change daily, from cajun sweet potato fries to parmesan truffle fries...so, so good. Are the fries crispy? No, but damn tasty!The chicken bruschetta is to die for....ground chicken, fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and olive oil.
