List(So we may need to apologize for the weather today in Northeast Ohio. Apparently our announcement of our three snow leopard triplets yesterday caused quite a stir. But to help you cope with the snow here is another picture of the cubs! Cubs should be on exhibit in late May or early June!, ICYMI we will share some additional photos of the snow leopard triplets that were born March 5 that we announced this morning. Keep checking back for more updates and photos soon! The cubs will be on exhibit in late May or early June!, For the first time in our history a litter of three snow leopard cubs have been born at the Akron Zoo. This is the third litter born to our female Snow Leopard Shanti, but her first set of triplets! The previous two litters, in 2012 and 2014, each consisted of two cubs. The three cubs, one female and two males, were born March 5, 2016 and are currently off exhibit in a private cubbing area with their mother. A naming contest will be announced in a few weeks. 
Snow leopards are an endangered species and a part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP).  These cubs mark the first snow leopards born in the U.S. at an AZA accredited zoo this year.
The cubs will remain indoors until they go into their exhibit, most likely at the end of May or early June. The cubs currently weigh about 4 lbs.; at birth they weighed about a pound each. At two weeks old the cubs opened their eyes, and now at four weeks old they are starting to move around and become mobile. 
The cubs’ father, Roscoe, will be on exhibit every day until Shanti and the cubs start to go out onto exhibit. As in the wild, the father does not participate in the rearing process and will not have direct contact with the cubs. Roscoe is 12 years old and came to the Akron Zoo in 2004 from the San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium. Shanti is seven years old and came to the Akron Zoo from the Binder Park Zoo in 2009. 
Snow leopards are endangered primarily due to loss of habitat, illegal poaching for their pelts and body parts and killings by local herders when a snow leopard has preyed on their livestock. There are 153 snow leopards in the SSP in the U.S. and there are believed to be as few as 4,000 left in the wild., Starting today through October we will be open 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. We hope to see you at the zoo!, null, We promise it's not a joke - our summer hours begin tomorrow!

CO2 is the largest-produced greenhouse gas in the United States. Production of electricity and transportation combined produced over 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. A great way to lower that number is to purchase fresh fruit and veggies from local farmer's markets, where the produce travels the shortest distance from farm to table.

The new parking lot also includes a first of its kind storm water management system in the state of Ohio. 
The new lot is located on zoo property along the corner of Edgewood Ave. and Euclid Ave. right near the main entrance of the zoo. The parking lot is near completion, but landscaping for the new lot will be planted in the spring.
“We are certainly humbled by how many people have visited the zoo recently and we are committed to making every guest’s visit as enjoyable as it can be,” commented Doug Piekarz, Akron Zoo president and CEO. “Adding these additional parking spots is an end result of the wonderful support we have received from our community. We are extremely grateful.” 
An above ground bioretention system, FocalPoint Biofiltration System, has been installed in the new parking lot. The zoo has become the first in the state of Ohio to use this new storm water management system. The system is designed so that storm water will be filtered into the FocalPoint and sediment and debris will be trapped before entering into the naturally formed aquifer that the zoo sits on, thus reducing pollution. The new parking lot also contains a StormTech Subsurface Stormwater Management System in the lower portion of the lots to assist with additional storm water runoff. 
These systems are part of the Akron Zoo’s overall storm water containment plan aimed at keeping as much rain water out of the City of Akron combined sewer system as possible, Don't forget we're running our Cyber Monday deal through Dec. 31!

“I do Zentangle-inspired drawings. A Zentangle is a drawing that looks very complicated, but if you simply look at it as drawing one line at a time, you will be even more surprised at the end result. Simple tangles, or patterns, are combined in an unplanned way that grows and changes in unbelievable and amazing ways. 

'No mistakes, just happy accidents' is my new mantra, and that is exactly how I got to this point in my artistic journey. I started seriously pursuing my artistic side again about five years ago. Drawing detailed and intricate patterns has helped me to rediscover my love of drawing. Once I started, I couldn't stop. I felt like 25 years of unleashed art was trying to push its way out, and I knew that there was so much more in me. So, I started selling my drawings to my family and friends, and it has grown beyond my wildest dreams.”

See you then!, We are posting some highlights from our keeper, Kathleen, who had the opportunity last week to go to Churchill and explore climate change. 
"Polar Bears International gathers like-minded people together from zoos all over the world to discuss climate change with leading arctic scientists, as well as discuss community based solutions we will all take a leadership role in. While I was in Churchill, Krista Wright, PBI's Executive Director, gave an inspiring presentation on the Tundra Buggy Lodge about building environmental literacy while focusing on a conservation ethic.  
97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real, and that we are causing it to accelerate by burning fossil flues such as coal, oil or natural gas we emit CO2 into the atmosphere.  This CO2 creates a layer which acts like a blanket around the earth, trapping heat that would normally radiate away from the earth.  The arctic ice is currently being heavily affected by this slow but steady rise in average global temperatures. Check out the video below by NASA to explore the recent trend in annual sea ice formation.http://climate.nasa.gov/interactives/climate-time-machine#.VhlX25OKUPI.gmail
One of the many highlights during my trip was we learned first hand from the Rangers of Manitoba Conservation about the Polar Bear Alert Program.  Polar Bears rely almost solely on a diet of seals to survive, which they hunt on thick sea ice. During the warmer months, these bears would naturally not eat for 5 months at a time, surviving on their fat reserves. In the past, the number of human/bear conflicts were rapidly increasing as the ice-free periods have been growing longer and bears began to scavenge within this small town. Better practices such as indoor composting and the Polar Bear Alert program, a hotline locals can use when a bear is spotted, has created a safer environment for the citizens and the bears. Bears that wander into town are relocated and problem bears are kept in the Polar Bear Holding Facility until they can be released onto the sea ice in the fall. Since the implementation of these practices there have been no human fatalities in the Churchill area due to polar bear attacks. This is a great example of how a community can come together and create real solutions to live peacefully with nature.For more information on how the Polar Bear Alert program works go to:
https://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/wildlife/spmon/pbear/pbear_alert.html" #climateAlliance #SaveOurSeaIce, We are just open for Boo at the Zoo today from 11:30 a.m. - 7:30 p.m. Come trick-or-treat at 12 different themed treats  stations.

What is your costume this Halloween?, So proud of our own, Kathleen Milk, and the great work she has been doing this week in Churchill to learn more about climate change. #ClimateAlliance #SaveOurSeaIce, A huge thank you to Acme Fresh Market for their support!, We continue to follow our keeper, Kathleen's journey with Polar Bear International to Churchill, Canada. She is further out on the tundra now so we don't have as much contact with her, but she did report back today with some exciting news:
"While bouncing across the landscape in our tundra buggies we saw a small white speck in the horizon straight ahead of us.  As we cautiously moved closer, our hopes were confirmed that it was a beautiful female polar bear.  As we turned off our vehicle, she continued to walk right past us, indifferent to our presence and continued on her course, only to stop just behind us to roll around in the bushes and take a rest.  This time of year, these bears have depleted much of their fat layer waiting for platforms of sea ice to hunt seals on.  We were happy to see that her size and body condition appeared to be healthy and she should be back on the ice in just a few weeks.", For the first time ever we have had a Chilean flamingo chick successfully hatch at the Akron Zoo. The chick is currently being raised indoors at the zoo’s animal hospital by zoo staff. The flamingo will not be on exhibit until spring. The flamingo egg was laid on exhibit July 25, 2015, and relocated to an artificial incubator in the zoo’s animal hospital in order to increase the chances of its survival. While in the incubator staff monitored the temperatures, humidity and the weight of the egg multiple times a day. The egg continued to develop for the next 26 days until the chick began to hatch on August 20, 2015. The chick took about 36 hours to fully emerge from the egg., Here's our daily update from our keeper, Kathleen, who is on a trip to Churchill with Polar Bear International this week to study climate change. "Today we went out in Frontiers North's large tundra buggies to get to the Churchill Northern Studies Centre.  These heavy duty buses are the safest way for us to travel the tundra for us and the polar bears.  On one particular section of the road we saw several animal tracks including snow geese, a timber wolf, and a polar bear!", Tickets are still available for tomorrow's Oktoberfest.

She is traveling as part of Polar Bears International’s (PBI) Climate Alliance. 
 "My name is Kathleen Milk, a zookeeper at the Akron Zoo, and I am on a journey of a lifetime to Churchill, Canada, the Polar bear capital of the world! Join me the next few days as I become Akron Zoo's first Climate Alliance Ambassador through Polar Bears International.

The Akron Zoo Chapter of The American Association of Zookeepers (AAZK) will be holding an aluminum can recycling event August 21 from 6:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. to raise money for Cans for Corridors. Money earned from recycled aluminum cans is used to plant tree corridors in the Brazilian rainforest. This corridor was targeted to help the two isolated populations of the endangered Black Lion Tamarin, of which there are only an estimated 1,000 individuals left in the wild.  Several other species benefit as well, including jaguars, ocelots, tapirs, other species of tamarins, and blue and yellow macaws. Since 2002, Cans for Corridors have raised enough money to plant 80,000 trees.
Through staff and volunteer donations alone, we have already recycled over 400 lbs. of aluminum cans and raised enough money to plant 235 trees! It is estimated that $0.75 plants one tree so every can counts! We hope to see you at the zoo on August 21st to help us reach our goal of 1,000 trees., Did you know one of our bald eagles is named after Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. 1st Class Leroy Petry?

Muffin has been at the zoo since 1998, but has not been on exhibit for several years because she has been battling cancer. 
Muffin was born in October, 1987 at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. The median life expectancy for sun bears is 23 years.  

In 2005, Muffin was diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma, a form of cancer. Her original prognosis was not good and measured in months, not years. Due to the excellent care by our professional animal care and veterinary staff, which included chemo and laser therapy, Muffin went into remission in 2009.  
Although she did not return to her public exhibit after her 2005 diagnosis, Muffin continued to live an enriched life, having access to her indoor and outdoor areas in the animal hospital and then most recently in Grizzly Ridge.

Since Muffin’s cancer diagnosis in 2005, there have been four other sun bears diagnosed with the same cancer, including her exhibit mate, Ringo, who succumbed to this form of cancer in 2008. Our veterinary staff worked with the staff at the University of Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine, providing samples from our sun bears as part of a study that discovered a new type of virus common to all of them which is now suspected to have contributed to the cause of the cancer.

In the week leading up to her passing, animal care staff noticed that she was becoming increasingly lethargic, and she was not eating much. Our veterinarian, Dr. Kim Cook, and the vet staff anesthetized her Saturday afternoon in order to complete a thorough assessment. Muffin did well during the procedure but failed to recover from anesthesia. 

A necropsy was performed to determine the cause of death, and samples will be sent to a veterinary pathologist for further analysis. The necropsy confirmed infection and fluid in her lungs, evidence of disease in her stomach and severe arthritis in her hips due to her advanced age. She had been on long-term treatments for her arthritis. https://www.akronzoo.org/News.aspx?P=1, Chris Pratt has nothing on our zoo keepers! #JurassicWorld #Jurassiczookeeper, Tonight is Members' Night for all our Akron Zoo members.

Recently a male jaguar, Chack, underwent a successful root canal to fix his canine tooth at the Akron Zoo. It was only the second known root canal to be performed on an animal at the Akron Zoo. 
The fractured tooth was noticed by our professional animal care staff. The surgery was done by local dentists, Dr. Lisa Petrov of Petrov Endodontics, INC. and her father, Dr. Nelson M. Petrov and zoo veterinarian, Dr. Kim Cook. The surgery is similar to a human’s, but the tooth is a lot bigger. Chack was given general anesthesia and the nerve canal was instrumented, sterilized and then filled with an inert material. Chack was able to keep his tooth and the surgery eliminated pain from the exposed nerve and chances of further infection.
“Chack has been doing great since the surgery. We are monitoring him closely, but he hasn’t missed a meal and he’s interacting with all of his enrichment as normal.” commented Cook., Celebrate Earth Day this weekend at our Party for the Planet event Saturday & Sunday! https://www.akronzoo.org/Party%20for%20the%20Planet/92/1/1, Make sure you don't miss out on a chance to register your child for Zoo Camp this summer.

PANDORA’S CREATIONS. Diane Mallow has always been the artsy, creative, outdoorsy type. She believes this is a direct result of being raised on a working farm. Growing up this way fed her addiction for creating beautiful things out of unwanted items, and led her to form Pandora’s Creations two years ago. 
Diane creates many different items out of old vinyl records. Purses are just one of the original items that she creates. She creates a very unique purse by using every piece of the vinyl record and cover in her designs, and recycles belts for the straps of the purse. Diane loves designing record clocks of any theme not just music. She also creates coaster sets, baskets, bowls, cupcake stands, cuffs and other types of jewelry out of the records. The possibilities for what she’ll create next with a record are endless!

"We have expanded our product line to many animals, and have added new animals every season. Rather than buy new materials, we decided to use as much recycled material as possible.

As we became known, we found other resources:  discontinued decorator and fabric samples, costume and theater department scraps, vintage clothing.  We even make the bags in which we package our creations at craft shows."

"Each of my designs is unique and woven with rich and varicolored precious metals, paired with such elements as turquoise, pearls, labradorite, jade, jasper, coral, olivine, crystals, lampwork and found objects - all with a hint of whimsy and often a hidden garden critter!  I also rescue and redesign found vintage components while applying both traditional and contemporary methods to create unusual, textured surfaces.    
I like to create designs that not only entice the wearer to really look at the artistic design and detailed work involved, but to also discover its texture and beauty. Each wearable piece of art embraces the 
wearer’s independent personality."

"I had an interest in photography early on, but hadn't taken it further than just casual vacation pictures until after college when I realized that I completed my degree in Biological Sciences and hadn't taken one 'fun' class. As a graduation present to myself I bought my first DSLR, the Nikon D40, and began my journey as a self-taught photographer. I love taking photos of the world as I see it, but trying to express myself through photography needed something more than just focal lengths and apertures. I found Photoshop and threw myself into it. It was a creative outlet that allows the inner drama of any photo to be unleashed. I will admit that I use many techniques to push an image to something more, the key is to always allow restraint to keep the viewer grounded to this reality, mostly."

Last year we had our largest attendance in zoo history with over 389,000 visitors.   

“It is hard to see Pat go, we wish her the best of luck and know she will do an outstanding job for them as she did for us.  The Akron Zoo is in a strong position and the Akron Zoo Board of Directors will work to make sure it remains the most visited attraction in Summit County as we continue to implement the future strategic master plan,” states Bob Littman, Chairman Akron Zoo Board of Trustees.

Details at http://www.akronzoo.org/news/Photocontest2010.asp , Five endangered red ruffed lemurs are now on exhibit at the Akron Zoo. This is the first time in the zoo’s history that red ruffed lemurs have been at the Akron Zoo. The lemurs, which is the Latin word for ghost, are on exhibit just in time for the zoo’s Boo at the Akron Zoo, which starts October 15, 2011. 

The red ruffed lemurs came from the Central Florida Zoo in Sanford, Florida, where they were born. The troop, which is a group of lemurs, are all siblings. There are a set of twin girls that are two years old and a set of triplets that are one year of age. The zoo has two other species of lemurs – black and white ruffed and ring-tailed. The lemurs reside in the Madagascar Building in the zoo’s Legends of the Wild exhibit.

Like all lemurs, the red ruffed lemurs are native only to Madagascar. Red ruffed lemurs live in deciduous tropical forests of the Masoala Peninsula in northeastern Madagascar, at elevations up to 3,300 feet. Red ruffed lemurs are one of the largest species of lemurs. They average 43-47 inches in length including their tail, which can be about 22-25 inches. Adults weigh between 7-10 pounds. Red ruffed lemurs have a narrow, fox-like snout and small ears that are hidden by a ruff of hair. Their fur is a deep rusty red while their extremities, forehead, crown, belly and tail are black. They have a patch of white fur on the nape of the neck and may have additional white patches on the feet, digits or mouth. Life span in the wild for these primates are 15-20 years; they can live up to 19 years in captivity. 

All lemurs are endangered species; the red ruffed lemur is considered critically endangered, and is protected under Appendix I of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species, (CITES). Habitat destruction, hunting and live capture for the pet or animal trades place severe pressures on lemur populations and are the leading causes of endangerment.
