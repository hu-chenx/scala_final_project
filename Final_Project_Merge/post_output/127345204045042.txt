DRINKS!
Cider Fizz
Cherry Limeade, HAPPY 2016!
We'd like to welcome our new followers to our page! We've noticed we have picked up lots of new "likes" the past few weeks and would like to let everyone know how we operate. 

We are full time! 
We do stay open through the winter months and do our best to keep our schedule full. However, sometimes weather does make things tough for us. Heavy rain, snow, below freezing temps, lightning, snow banks, ice... Things like that make us have to keep our window closed. Sometimes we try to stick it out, but sometimes we have to make a last minute schedule change. Check here or Instagram or Twitter for latest updates. 

Menu!
We change it up! All. The. Time. We feed so many of you more than once a week so we like to keep things interesting and have something new every time we see you. Things come and go and we bring our favorites and yours back often. 

Keep us in the loop! 
Craving something? Want something specific back on the menu? Want us to come to your office? Weekend event? Private party? Doesn't hurt to ask! We respond to everyone and no suggestion, question, or comment goes ignored. Don't be shy we always say!

Bottom line..
We like to have fun and enjoy what we do. We love feeding you and your office and your children! It may be cold, but we're there with you! Don't forget that we do call AND text ahead ordering. Treat us like your other favorite lunch spots and add us to your rotation.

**Photo Cred to one of our Insta-followers. Love it!**, We are not open today... But we are tomorrow through Friday! 

We planned a really yummo menu for you guys this week. We will post it in full tonight!

Have a great Monday!, YAY AHS! 
We have so much hometown pride! Class of '99 and '03 here guys!, THROWING A PARTY? 
We can help take care of the food!

This "graduation season" catering option runs through the end of June and applies to all shindigs. 

Email or message us for more info and availability., NEW TO MESS HAUL?
We have picked up quite a few new "likes" this month and would like to explain how we operate...

MENU! We change it up every week, but favorites come back around. (Steak and Brie anyone?) Menu is posted on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram too. Just find our most recent post and that'll probably have it listed.

LOCATION! We bop around town; mostly stay in our usual Andover spots however. We try and keep a steady schedule so we can easily be found and be a fun part of your lunch routine. 

ORDERING! We know it's tough to stand in line especially in the New England elements so call and text ahead is always available. It's wildly successful, and yes, everyone does it. Also... 

PREORDER! We run out. All. The. Time. It's the name of the food truck game. We can only pack so much and never know how much to bring. Preorder in the morning or the night before if you have your heart set on something. 

WE CATER! Parties, birthdays, reunions, events, fundraisers! We are booking up... Shoot us a message or email and we can send your our catering plans. Prices start at $10 a head. 

Thank you for supporting us, we love what we do, and appreciate being able to open that window everyday. 
Now BRING ON THAT WARM WEATHER!

Stefanie & Chef Mark, LAST DAY FOR CIDER FIZZ!
