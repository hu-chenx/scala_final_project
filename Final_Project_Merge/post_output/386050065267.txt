List(Just saw this last night and wanted to share.

#vegan #vegetarian #animalrights #feeltheBern, Happy Saturday! It's a gray old morning here in Cambridge, MA, but our doughnuts will have you up and smiling and licking your lips.
We have our signature LEMON MERINGUE PIE doughnut and a luscious PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY doughnut today. Both flavors are #vegan and #dairyfree!
(We make our own jelly btw.)
#NationalPeanutButterJellyDay #NationalPeanutButterAndJellyDay, Tomorrow is National Peanut Butter & Jelly Day, so we'll be observing it properly, with PB&J #vegan doughnuts!
We'll also have our Signature Lemon Meringue Pie vegan doughnuts (available every Saturday).
Doors open at 9 a.m., We're just tickled with our new signs by Daydream Design (http://www.daydreamdesign.com/). Check them out the next time you visit us!

#sometimesitsthelittlethings, Blowing kisses to Kristin LaJeunesse of Will Travel For Vegan Food for including Boston on this list! Think you'll recognize some of her favorite vegan stops in our fair city.

#vegan #veganBoston, Cambridge, MA's plastic bag ban starts TODAY!
We've always had compostable bags at Veggie Galaxy, but starting today we are required to charge you 10 cents/bag. We suggest carrying a couple of bags in your backpack/handbag to avoid the bag charge.
If you'd like to read some amazing statistics about plastic bags, click here: http://www.inspirationgreen.com/plastic-bag-stats.html, New Blue Plate Special starts tonight:
VEGAN CAPRESE SANDWICH
Sliced tomatoes & #vegan mozzarella, basil pesto and balsamic reduction on an Iggy's Bread ciabetta. Served with lightly dressed greens and your choice of potato salad, green cabbage slaw or potato chips.

***Available on our Dinner menu, starting at 5:00 p.m. Starts on a Wednesday and runs for a week.***, New Seitan Cutlet Special starts tonight!
Country-fried house-made Seitan Cutlet with a crispy/crunchy vegan buttermilk coating, Black Pepper Cream Gravy and sauteed Collard Greens. #vegan

***Available on our Dinner menu, starting at 5 p.m. Starts on a Wednesday and runs for a week.***, Our Gluten-Free Menu is no more. Please read this carefully. 

We love and respect our gluten-free guests, and we care deeply about their comfort and safety. 
We've been through at least 3 different gluten-free bread manufacturers in recent years. After it turned out that the first one was gf...but not vegan (Udi's), we switched to another brand (Food for Life), which had tiny slices and which most guests didn't like very much. We found another (Sami's Bakery, Sourdough Millet), which was (then) labeled "gluten-free but manufactured in a facility that contains gluten". We switched to that one. And then a couple of severely gluten-intolerant or celiac guests became ill after eating that bread here at Veggie Galaxy.
We contacted the company, and they explained that they have recently had to stop labeling their bread as "gluten-free", as it tested at 100 parts (of gluten) per million. The legal requirement to call something "gluten-free" is that it must have less than 20 parts per million. They now represent it as "low gluten".
Here's what really gave us pause: Sami's Bakery's "gluten-free" bread contains NO gluten ingredients. They break down and wash their equipment between gluten and non-gluten bread bakes. And the bread still tested at over the legal limit for being called gluten-free due to uncontrollable cross contamination.
Here at Veggie Galaxy many of our dishes contain no gluten ingredients. We take every reasonable precaution to avoid cross contamination. However, if cross contamination can occur at the Sami's production facility with their vigilance, we regretfully conclude that it could happen here also. We can't in good conscience allow gluten-intolerant/celiac guests to believe that they are safe when it is possible that cross contamination could have occurred. On the grill, where a gluten-free pancake could pick up a crumb left by a non-gluten-free pancake. On a cutting board, a spatula or a knife...even though we clean them well. 

We reprinted our menus yesterday and now have only one version; there is no gluten-free menu anymore. All the same food is available, with the same substitutions (low gluten bread for sandwiches and burgers, "gf" pancakes, subbing tofu for seitan, etc.). But we are being very careful in order to keep everyone safe and healthy (and in order to be legal), and not calling anything "gluten-free" anymore, given the scariness of uncontrollable cross contamination. Our Servers have been briefed and can help guide you to making a good choice for your level of gluten intolerance. We hope that you understand the spirit of caution and concern that has prompted this change at Veggie Galaxy., Introducing our new Chickpea "Tuna" Melt! This is now on our regular menu, available all day and replaces our "Melt" Sandwich. It's sooo good! 
Available #vegan or #vegetarian.
Chickpea "tuna" salad, kale, tomato, aged cheddar (or vegan Daiya or our house vegan cheese). Served on locally made @iggysbakery bread with lightly dressed field greens and your choice of potato chips, potato salad or green cabbage slaw.
Give it a try and let us know what you think!, Nice list from the kind folks at Spoon University - Wash U. Thanks so much for including us!

***Available on our Dinner menu, starting at 5 p.m. Starts on a Wednesday and runs for a week.***, This article on time.com came out last year on #WorldWaterDay, but it is still relevant. Here's tip #2 from the article:

"Take a Break from Meat: Showering and hydration are hardly your main uses of water—but food is. The average American uses 7,500 liters of water each day, according to the U.N. If you’re eating meat, your water usage shoots way up; a steak dinner for two requires 15,000 liters of water for the meat alone. Eating more meat and dairy has been the single greatest factor for water consumption in the past 30 years, says the group—so going vegetarian, even temporarily, can make a difference.", The powdered sugar on this dish (French Toast w/added Mixed Berries & Coconut Whipped Cream) looks a lot like what was on the ground outside here in Cambridge this morning. 
Happy to report that it seems to be melting now. We're ready for Spring to be back!

#vegandoughnuts #vegandonuts, Interesting article about some of the new words for the ways folks are eating in 2016. All seem to have good intentions; just different motivations. 

In a year of Republicans, Democrats, red states & blue states, conservatives and liberals, it seems a shame to let our food divide us even more., We depend upon reliable and quick line cooks, and we could use a few more at Veggie Galaxy. Please spread the word!
Interested parties can apply in person or at veggiegalaxyemployment@gmail.com., This is in Spain, but wouldn't it be great to see gardens on the roofs of all our MBTA buses? Just thinking about it makes us feel warmer!, Which is better?

One is the luscious Black Forest Cake that our #vegan bakery just finished making, which we'll have available after 4:00 today.
The other is a shot that we loved from over on Instagram (taken by and shared w/permission of IGer @roystercrackers), showing how to try both of our "boozy milkshakes" at once!
However and wherever you'll be seeing the old year out, we want to thank you for sharing some of 2015 with us, whether it's here on Facebook or at the restaurant. We are so grateful for your business, your friendship, your patience, your suggestions and your nice posts, reviews & photos when you visit Veggie Galaxy. Thank you, and may 2016 be a healthy and happy year for you and your loved ones., New Seitan Cutlet and Blue Plate Specials start tonight!

***Both specials start on a Wednesday and run for a week.***, We're looking forward to Michael Pollan's new show, premiering tonight (Wednesday 12/30) on WGBH at 9:00. Here's a blurb about it:
"'Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.' 
With that seven-word maxim, US-based journalist Michael Pollan (The Omnivore’s Dilemma) distills a career’s worth of reporting into a prescription for reversing the damage being done to people’s health by today’s industrially driven Western diet. In Defense of Food debunks the daily media barrage of conflicting claims about nutrition. Traveling the globe and exploring the supermarket aisles to illustrate the principles of his bestselling “eater’s manifesto,” Pollan offers a clear answer to one of the most confounding and urgent questions of our time: What should I eat to be healthy?", Capers: we use them in our food at Veggie Galaxy, you use them at home...but what the heck are those little salty morsels?, Another plug for following us on Instagram. Here are our 9 most popular (received the most "likes") IG posts of 2015.
It doesn't surprise us at all that this includes 2 cheesecakes (S'mores & Peppermint Patty), 2 shots of our poutine, 2 pancakes (Taza Chocolate & Gingerbread), 2 doughnuts...and a beautiful Cambridge sunset! All #vegan.

Most of these photos were also posted here on Facebook, but although nearly 7,000 of you follow our Facebook page (thank you!) the mysterious and frustrating Facebook algorithm generally only puts our daily post in front of a couple hundred of you...unless we pay them to circulate it more widely. Frankly we can't afford to do that more than a couple times a year, for major announcements.

Google-search "Veggie Galaxy, Instagram" for a peek at our account. Click on any photo there to read the description/post. You'll need a smartphone to get the Instagram app, but you can keep tabs on us on your computer this way (bookmark it).

Thank you so much for following Veggie Galaxy here on Facebook in 2015!

"Lovely lunch with Kristin of @wtfveganfood at @veggiegalaxy. Made myself not get breakfast food and try something new! Based on reviews I opted for the Rachel - grilled shaved corned-beef seitan, green cabbage slaw, house made vegan cheese, and thousand island dressing on sourdough. I really got out of my comfort zone bc I usually hate seitan but this was kind of amazing. Really happy with  my choice."

Here at Veggie Galaxy we had to cancel our Pre-Valentine's Day dinner with the Boston Vegetarian Society, we lost one day of the special weekend since the T wasn't running, and in general it just wasn't as busy and festive as Valentine's Day usually is around here because of the weather.
Gov. Baker has proclaimed this week "Valentine's Week" in the Commonwealth of MA ( http://goo.gl/DbyKMM ), to give everyone another chance to have a good Valentine's Day, and we're on board with that! 
Our Kitchen will be offering, starting tonight, some of the special "finer diner" dishes we had planned for the BVS dinner, as our Blue Plate, our Seitan Cutlet Special and as a special fancy Appetizer. There will also be special desserts available this week.

To borrow from the Huffington Post's article last year on this day, "We don't really need many reasons to eat pie. We're happy to do it all day, every day...". True enough. 

In fact our Pastry Chef is going to be making 17 vegan Lemon Meringue Pies for a wedding tomorrow where they'll be having them instead of a wedding cake!

Here are a few photos of our #vegan "Mile High Lemon Meringue Pie" for you to enjoy. Hope you'll find yourself a piece of pie today.

www.veggiegalaxy.com, Some folks on Twitter have brought another list to our attention, so we're sharing it here for those who may be interested in checking it out. 
This one is Thrillist's THE 21 BEST VEGETARIAN/VEGAN RESTAURANTS IN AMERICA list. Thank you @Thrillist and author @rachelifreeman - - we are truly honored. 
Every time we find ourselves on a "Best of" list it makes us strive to be even better; to live up to the kind words.
(...and yes, we are definitely aware that there are other excellent vegetarian/vegan restaurants in Cambridge/Boston that aren't on this list. We think it's a really good thing to see a growing market for veg/vegan food  and for lists such as this. We also understand that any "Best of" list may or may not include your personal favorite. Fortunately we all have our moment in the sun!)

www.veggiegalaxy.com, Boston's not on the list yet, but it's a good goal to have!

Which veg-friendly city is your favorite?, It's National WATERMELON Day today!
(There are a lot of these food "special days", and we think it's fun to recognize them once in awhile.)
It just so happens that our current Blue Plate Special features WATERMELON, so today is a perfect day to come for dinner and give it a try! Here's the description, in case you didn't happen to see it when it started on Wednesday of last week.

www.veggiegalaxy.com, Veggie Galaxy is expecting a very busy summer and we are looking to add some members to our FOH staff ASAP!

SERVER POSITION

First and foremost, we are looking for genuinely warm and friendly people who thoroughly enjoy giving great customer service. Experience in high volume food service is definitely a plus, as Veggie Galaxy is a very up-tempo environment in which you may be required to juggle three or four plates while heading towards one table, stop at a second table to answer questions, and say hello to a regular while passing by a third, all while maintaining a genuine smile on your face.

COUNTER POSITION

We are currently seeking qualified applicants for the Front Counter/Retail Bakery position. We are looking for genuinely warm and friendly people who thoroughly enjoy giving great customer service. Experience in a fast-paced, high-volume service environment is definitely a plus, but not required. You must love making customers happy, and rising to the challenge of giving them the best quality service, even while looking at a line of people out the door. If you enjoy smiling, then this may be the job for you!

Please email Matt at matthewpmarini@yahoo.com with a little about yourself, why you're interested in Veggie Galaxy and a resume!

www.veggiegalaxy.com, What you've been waiting for...stay tuned!

#veggiegalaxy #blog #blueplatespecial #behindthescenes #vegetarian #vegan #Boston #CambridgeMA #diner, This article from The New Yorker is interesting and you may have an opinion about it.  Still, we think it's good to read about the turning towards vegetarian/vegan food in the general public these days.  #vegetarian #vegan #food 
www.veggiegalaxy.com, A big THANK YOU to all who voted for Veggie Galaxy in the DIG This Awards recently.  Results are out and we're very happy to have won in the "Vegan Friendly" category!  Here's the write-up from the DIG's Awards issue:

"VEGAN FRIENDLY
Veggie Galaxy
If the mark of a great vegan joint is that people who ordinarily deplore meatless fare can’t stop talking about how damn good it is, then Veggie Galaxy is guilty as charged. Their veggie burgers and baked mac and cheese have likely mended countless fractured relationships between health nuts and carnivores alike who can peacefully dine here in unison, and for that we salute them.

www.veggiegalaxy.com, Thought that some of you with little ones in your lives might enjoy these fun ways of serving a healthy lunch/snack., We're now serving house-made PICKLES here at Veggie Galaxy. 

Chef Sam has fiddled with the formula over the past month or so, so we'd love your feedback if you've tried our pickles (since the degree of dill-ness/sweet-ness has changed, let us know when you tried them if you can remember).  Everyone has their preference, but we're going for the classic diner dill.

www.veggiegalaxy.com, COME COOK WITH US!

Our Kitchen is looking for a couple of new Cooks (FULL and PART-TIME) to join the team, and we wondered if you might help us get the word out. The job description is pasted below. Please feel free to share this widely!

"VEGGIE GALAXY in Central Square, Cambridge is looking for experienced Line/Prep Cooks to join our team at this very busy, award winning restaurant. 
Ideal candidates have 1+ years line experience and the following qualifications:

- familiarity with all stations (grill, sautee, fry)
- expediter experience
- strong knife skills
- ability to prep large amounts quickly and efficiently
- comfort working in an open kitchen and having customer interaction
- breakfast cookery, as breakfast is served all day. 
- a desire and ability to work hard and have fun at the same time.

Day, evening and weekend availability all desired. Full-time and part-time positions available.

Please email VeggieGalaxyKitchen@gmail.com (or VeggieGalaxyEmployment@gmail.com) with a restaurant-focused resume, including date you can start and when you're free to interview." 

www.veggiegalaxy.com, Good morning!
We're here and ready to serve you.  Hope you'll have a great week.
www.veggiegalaxy.com, With Spring now here (at least by the calendar), we're all going to be reaching into our closets for warmer-weather clothing soon.  This sounds like a great trick to help us all weed out clothes that we can donate or give away., Veggie Galaxy would like to apologize to all who tried to come into our restaurant after 9:00 last night and found a locked door despite our posted hours saying that we're open till 11:00 p.m. on Saturday nights. We believe in owning our mistakes, and this was a big one.  We feel that we owe you an explanation. Yesterday was, unfortunately, a "perfect storm".  

Saturday was a beautiful early-Spring day with lots going on in Boston/Cambridge, so that both locals and out-of-towners were out and about and looking to cap off their day with a fun meal at Veggie Galaxy.  That's the good part - we are grateful that so many of them wanted to join us for dinner.

Unfortunately, however, we are operating right now with both not-enough kitchen staff and some brand-new kitchen staff.  Some team members are on leave to go on band tours, and another cut herself badly and had to be taken to the Emergency Room just before dinner seating began. Routine tasks such as ordering and prepping were not executed properly before dinner service began, so we quickly ran out of ingredients for several popular dishes...and then more and more of our offerings became impossible to make.  

The decision to close was made at 9:00. In hindsight, we would have certainly preferred to greet all new customers, explain the lengthy list of things we were out of by then, and give them a choice about whether or not they still wanted to be seated.  Some would have certainly chosen to go elsewhere, but they would have had the opportunity to decide that for themselves.  

We know that some of you traveled quite a distance to be with us last night or had planned your visit and looked forward to it for quite some time.  We feel just awful today to hear how we disappointed you.  We totally understand your frustration and anger, and will make all efforts to ensure that something like this never happens again., Our new Chocolate Cheesecake (#vegan) is an ALMOND JOY CHEESECAKE. It's dark, rich and delicious.  Hope you'll get to try it!
#veggiegalaxy #chocolate  #CambridgeMA #Boston 
www.veggiegalaxy, Thank you SCIENCE, for assuring us that it's good for us to eat dark chocolate. We use Taza Chocolate (dark chocolate) in our vegan baked goods and Hot Chocolate at Veggie Galaxy, so indulge and enjoy!
www.veggiegalaxy.com, Our new SEASONAL VEGETABLE ENTREE is a collaboration between Chef Sam at Veggie Galaxy and Chef Chelsea from our sister resto Veggie Planet. 
Red Quinoa, sautéed Fiddleheads, Rosti (Swiss hash browns) & Cherry Tomatoes w/a Maple-Ginger glaze. Hearty and wild enough for the blustery days of early Spring, but with  the promise of a new growing season just around the corner. 
Give it a try! (On our Dinner menu.)
www.veggiegalaxy.com, Looks like the world is finding its way to Central Square these days! Looking forward to having the "Shark Tank" team in town next month.  
We'll be brewing up plenty of coffee that morning, and opening at 7:00 a.m. (our usual weekday opening time).  Plan your pitch in our cozy booths!
www.veggiegalaxy.com, The first day of Spring calls for a nice cool FRAPPE!  
Here's one of our young customers Rips enjoying what looks like a Chocolate Frappe at Veggie Galaxy recently. Thanks to his Dad Sean for letting us share Rips' ADORABLE face on Facebook!

Tomorrow, on New Year's Day, we will be open at 9:00 a.m., with hot coffee and a good breakfast for you.

Had to share some photos of the 2nd Course choices for this evening...Split Colored Beet/Potato Soup and Tempeh Bacon wrapped Pineapple. Chef Sam has outdone himself!
We still have some seats available for the 8:30 seating - - just call us at (617) 497-1513 to reserve.

Here's hoping that 2014 will be an excellent year!, A drool-inducing stroll through some of 2013's weekly Seitan Cutlet Specials. "Like" and/or Comment on the ones you liked the best.

"Like" or comment on the one that you liked the best, so we'll know which one(s) should make a comeback in 2014!, Have a peaceful Sunday.
, We are fortunate to have/have had some amazing folks on our staff.  For some of them, cooking for and serving Veggie Galaxy's customers has been a step along the way to careers serving the greater good.

We're getting ready to say goodbye to two of our Counter staff members; LANG and ZOE, who will be leaving us very soon.
Lang will be moving to California to do some important work with people in the prison system there, and Zoe is going all the way to Indonesia to work in the Peace Corps. 

We thank both of them for stopping off here at Veggie Galaxy to work with us for awhile, and wish them both safe travels and much success in their new roles.  Please do the same if you happen to be at the restaurant in the next few days., Cold days like this make you look forward to a hearty, warming meal for dinner.  Our new SEITAN CUTLET SPECIAL satisfies those requirements and is also delicious and healthy!

It's a SEITAN PICCATA this week.  We start with our vegan house-made Seitan Cutlet, which is breaded and plated with our Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  Snuggled up next to the cutlet is a side of Brussels Sprouts sautéed with Garlic, Shallots, Chili Fakes and Capers in a Lemon/White Wine Piccata sauce., Just got the news from our Bakery about the "TBA" desserts for Course Five of our NEW YEAR'S EVE "FINER DINER" celebration.

Who needs the other Four Courses and the complimentary Champagne/Sparkling Cider with desserts like that?  Call us at (617) 497-1513 or stop in to reserve your spot at the 6:30 or 8:30 seating.#NewYearsEve #vegandesserts #Cambridge #Boston, Here you go; our new BLUE PLATE SPECIAL!
  
Chef Christian's calling it "Rhode Island Style Fried Calamity"...referencing "Rhode Island style Calamari", since Calamari is such a classic Christmas-season dish in many households. "Rhode Island style"means the crispy fried rings and tentacles (of a squid, traditionally) are tossed with thin loops of pickled hot peppers.  

No squid in this dish, but instead we're using deep-fried Cremini Mushrooms and Onions, seasoned and tossed with sautéed Red Fresno Peppers (similar to jalapenos), Cherry Tomatoes, Garlic and Basil. Served with a pickled red onion and arugula side salad. 

We recommend a nice cold beer with this tasty meal., We are open beginning at 9:00 a.m. today and will be announcing our new BLUE PLATE and SEITAN CUTLET specials (which start tonight) later today.

SEITAN CUTLET: It's a "Seitan Marsala", starting with our housemade seitan cutlet (breaded w/herbed flour, not panko this week), and topped with Cremini Mushrooms, Shallots, Garlic, Rosemary and Marsala wine. Comes with our Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The Marsala sauce will be made to order in the pan with the mushrooms & shallots.  A gorgeous dish!

BLUE PLATE SPECIAL: Remember meatloaf sandwiches? Well Chef Christian is riffing on that memory with this "BBQ SweetLoaf Sandwich". It's made with celery, onions, potatoes, parsnips, millet and spices and is GLUTEN-FREE! Topped with arugula, garlic mayo, cheddar (or daiya/house vegan cheese), crispy fried red onions (Gluten-Free), drizzled with Lady Chris' mustard BBQ sauce, and served on a grilled house-made bun (or gluten free bread).

Other ideas?, Just a reminder that we will be closing one hour early tonight (at 9:00 instead of 10:00) for our staff holiday party., On December 16, 1773, more than 5,000 colonists met at the Old South Meeting House to decide the fate of 3 shiploads of tea docked in Boston Harbor.  We all know what happened to that tea.

Today, on the 240th anniversary of that historic event, we suggest that you commemorate it by enjoying one of our TEA SPECIALS.  Counter Manager Marissa has concocted a ROOIBOS LATTE and a ROOIBOS FRAPPE and both are absolutely delicious.  Shown here is Judea with an early version of the latte.

The Rooibos latte uses local importer MEM Tea's organic Rooibos tea brewed in house, lightly sweetened.  It's steamed with soy milk and sprinkled with cinnamon. The Rooibos frappe uses that same MEM tea base and adds Vanilla FoMu coconut-based vegan ice cream.

(If you're not familiar with Rooibos Tea, here's what the MEM Tea website says about it: "This 'Red Bush' herbal tea from South 
Africa is very high in anti-oxidants. Its unique flavor is rich yet soft, 
with hints of citrus and vanilla. The orange-red liquor has the 
distinction of being an herbal tea that takes milk well. NO CAFFEINE."), Good morning!  Don't you love the face that Derek made on these pancakes?
