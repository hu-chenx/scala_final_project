I think it‚Äôs time to communicate my intentions and direction.
After many years of making my living working in restaurants, I am cutting the chord so that I might try to build something of my own. Something of our own.

If you‚Äôre a (Facebook) friend then you know at least a couple things about me. I have an amazing and beautiful family, was recently married to one of those beautiful people in September and among other highlights, I make bagels.

You‚Äôve seen pictures. Or you ate one/them/some.

Some of you have asked me where you can get/buy one/them/some. Sometimes the questions even have as many as four or five question marks. (???? Or ?????) That tells me you really want bagels. And I wanna make them for you.

The plan to bring you Exodus Bagels:
My search for kitchen space has been tough. There are a couple great commissary options, but at $30/hour, it‚Äôs simply not possible to make anything more than break-even money from one large batch. Prohibitive.

Solution:

I have been approaching local businesses (mostly pizza joints) and promoting the idea of a pop-up bagel shop on Saturday or Sunday mornings. I have been met with some interest. I am currently negotiating one opportunity.

This means that you might be able to eat a fresh baked Exodus bagel in Jamaica Plain sometime in the near future.

Thanks for taking the time to read this update. And if you want information about any possible Exodus Pop-Ups, please be sure and follow me on Facebook and/or Instagram., null, Simple. And delicious.
