While we appreciate our growth, and increased volume, our focus is and always will be on quality over quantity.

We want to make sure that everyone of our gracious patrons knows that we will continue to brain-storm and make improvements.

Please email us at info@sevenstarstreetbistro.com with any specific questions and concerns.

Happy New Year

*** We have an exciting announcement for everyone***  
Our online ordering is finally live! You can now access the online ordering page on our website www.sevenstarstreetbistro.com . We have been working on this feature for almost a year now, and will continue to work hard to bring you every convenience we possibly can. We love hearing from you when you call in, but for those who enjoy the convenience of ordering online it will allow us to grow even more and bring you the best customer service possible. Enjoy!, Tim McCarthy @McCarthy4Boston, Michelle Wu @wutrain, Marty Walsh, @marty_walsh Thank you so much for standing in our corner! Is there anything any of us can do other than waiting it out, for a standard license to become available? Not only for the sake of our restaurant we would love to see change happen, where a beer and wine license is much more attainable for small restaurants without the capital to purchase one on the open market. Restaurants are notoriously difficult to open, run, and sustain. If we could make some of these licenses more accessible, it might allow and inspire other young restaurateurs and chefs to enter the market, and more importantly sustain themselves. #keepbostoncreative #boston #smallbusiness #roslindale, Hello All, just wanted to give everyone an update on construction and the results of our beer and wine hearing...
With regards to our beer and wine license, we want to keep you updated particularly because so many of you took time to write letters, and sign our petition, and really that support was amazing and humbling. We received notification that although we were not denied for a beer and wine license we do not qualify for one of the new licenses available because we do not fall into the  "main streets" district or an "empowerment zone." Thus we have to hope and cross fingers that another license becomes available of which there are currently none. We are still proceeding with construction because we will not let this stop us from completing our vision for our bistro. We owe it to ourselves and all of you! The beer and wine license is however something we will continue to pursue as for any restaurant, the ability to serve at very least beer and wine, completes any full service dine in experience and allows long term economic viability, and we plan to be here in Rozzie for the long term. My wife and I have moved to the area and have done so to make a full time commitment to this area and our business. We will continue to keep you all posted and sincerely thank you for all the support!, Hey friends! Want to thank those of you who have submitted letters and signed our petition for a beer & wine license! We are blown away by the support and feel very humbled. It's not too late if you still want to send along a statement or brief letter in support of our application for the license. You can PM us or email @ info@sevenstarstreetbistro.com. Our hearing date is Sept 10th at City Hall. Wish us luck! Thanks so much! #LoveRozzie #Roslindale #Boston #Westroxbury #Jamaicaplain, We are back and operational thanks for your patience!, Experiencing technical difficulties with our POS tonight. May cause phone delays. We can only accept credit card at this time. If you have trouble calling please try again a bit later tonight. Sorry for any inconvenience., We are experiencing some technical difficulty with our POS so expect phone delays. At the moment we can only take credit card payments. We apologize for any inconvenience., We missed you guys! Back at it tonight folks! Open at 5:00 as usual :), Dear Friends, We are so excited to announce that we have officially commenced renovations for a "dine-in" space at Seven Star Street Bistro! While we have some work to get done before the new space will be open to the public (See photos :)) we are also working very hard to acquire a Beer & Wine license as part of our plan to enhance the dining experience. 
***Over these last 3 years in business, many of you have expressed a desire for us to serve Beer & Wine and so we are humbly asking for your support in this process. Without neighborhood/community & patron support we cannot get the license. We have a hearing date of September 10th and we need your support before that date. If you could take just a few minutes to compose a brief letter or even a brief statement in support of Seven Star Street Bistro, located at 151-155 Belgrade Ave., Roslidale MA 02131 for a Wine & Malt Beverage (Beer & Wine) License, and email it to us at info@sevenstarstreetbistro.com or PM us on facebook, we would be most grateful! All you need to include is your name/address (or which city you live in), relationship to our business and why you think we should be granted a beer & wine license. 
***Thank you so much everyone! If you have any questions for us, please don't hesitate to get in touch with Chris or Michelle. We will be back at it next week August 27th doing what we've always done and can't wait! Please bear with us as construction might still be underway :), Just a reminder that Seven Star will be closed for summer vacation Sunday Aug 10-Tuesday Aug 26, re-opening Wed, Aug 27th. We will miss you all, but we will be getting some much needed rest and construction done during the break. More details to come! Enjoy yourselves everyone! :), Hey guys! Seven Star's Chef Christopher Lin contributed his thoughts on family-run business in this great Boston Globe article. Check it out! :) Chef Chris has been so fortunate to work alongside his father Joseph who since the 1970's has strived to improve his craft every day. This is a lesson that Chef Chris and the SSSB team take to heart each day. Enjoy the article!, Back at it tonight folks! Hope everyone enjoyed the holiday...some sage advice from The Dalai Lama :), Happy 4th everyone! Just a reminder we will be closed tonight and re-open tomorrow for normal hours.
