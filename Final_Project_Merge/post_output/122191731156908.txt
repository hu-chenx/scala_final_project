We're working but we'll see you friends tomorrow for normal lunch and a quicker foot traffic (we think). Meanwhile, we leave you with some words from the good man we honor today:, Hello my friends! We had an amazing week one, to tell you the truth. Here I am with the champagne one of our friends brought on Monday! The week had ups and downs- and sideways too ;) -but overall it was amazing. 

Once again we want to thank you: for your loyalty, patience, support, critiques, encouragement, suggestions....

In just one week we've realized our food is still not for everyone, and that the new time demands mean we change our schedules and even prep styles. But all of this new knowledge helps us serve you better. 

* For this reason we're implementing the hours of Monday to Friday 7am-7pm. During this winter we won't open Saturdays. *

 Our food, as we've always said, is not bought, canned or frozen, even if it's hard to believe because the taste is different. In order to cook things as fresh as possible and still keep up with demand we have to start cooking early and stay late, so weekends will be very helpful. We'll use them to buy all supplies, pre-prep, and also get some rest. 

We hope you may still visit us on weekdays and keep considering us for your caterings and events! As always, continue talking to us please. This is more than a business, it's our life and our home and you're like family. 

Thank you kiddos, moving forward to many more weeks, happy times and fun cooking!!! GBU <3 -Momma King, One week! Woooooo! Happy Friday my friends, come have a cookie! ;), Hooray! (Like our friend Jimbo says) it's Friday eve! See you at lunch kiddos!, Day 3: It has been a whirlwind. We've met so many new friends and rejoiced in their welcoming comments and reviews. But we've also seen so many of you, friends from our gas station days, and it's so heartwarming to reconnect again. Here we have a photo from our friend Geoff Wong, with our other friend Mike Buksa, who used to visit us at the Beacon Hill shop pretty much weekly. As we get used to this new location, new demands, new hours and... new everything (!) it's so encouraging to see known faces and know we're remembered. Thank you my friends, you're still the BEST customer-friends EVER <3 :) #MommaKing #bestburritosback #bestburritoinboston, wiped out early again, getting the hang of it #promise.

of garlic and red bell pepper. ..doesn't hurt!)and Italian dressing. Now pre-heat your oven to 375. Then, in an aluminum pan, put some aluminum foil and spray it with a little food spray. Squeeze the lime and seasons the fish on both sides to taste with the condiments, pour some drops of the Italian dressing on top of the fish to taste, then put the asparagus on top of the fish and pour a little more Italian dressing on top of them. (Look at the pics) Cover your pan with aluminum foil and pinch the top with a fork,  put your pan in the oven and let it bake for 30 minutes or until the asparagus are tender and voil√†....Mine it's in the oven right now...I will post a pic when ready!

Let's make this morning spiiiicy!!!!!, Working hard and getting ready for our sampling & sale of our UNIQUE BLACK SALSA @ WILLIAMS-SONOMA NATICK MALL!!! See you there kiddos from 11:00 to 5:00 pm!!!, My dear Friends: as you all know, times have been very difficult for us trying to get relocated. Different situations have been going on, like a place being very expensive in rent, not finding the right builder, or landlords changing agreements, etc. Well, today it seems that we might have another opportunity for our relocation.

It's make me happy, but to be honest I do not want to go crazy because every time it is much more harder for me to realize that a certain place was not the right for us :(   

I need to have your help and I need to have your honest opinion.  As I've always said you are not my customers, YOU ARE MY FAMILY and this is very important for me because that means that if I can get this place I will see you all again!!! 

Please tell me.....WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ROSLINDALE,( exactly Washington St. one block from Adams Park) for VILLA MEXICO'S relocation?

Transportation is not a problem because all the buses that are based at Forest Hill T Station (orange line) go that way, it takes ten minutes with traffic to get there. Eventhough there is no parking place, there is a municipal parking lot close by, plus the street parking spaces (no meters) and a possibility to get a parking deal with some surrounding businesses there. 

Roslindale is having a new atmosphere and as well as JP, they do not have an authentic Mexican food, and there is a good possibility to serve beer and wine. 

My dear Family... What do you think about this location? Do you think it would be very difficult for you to go there? If not, how many times do you think you might go in a month? Would you place catering orders? 

THANK YOU MY FRIENDS, YOUR HELP IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND USEFUL FOR US!!! God Bless You all!!!, How are you doing my dears?! I'm cooking for Saturday's salsa sale at the Natick Mall and checking more @KS_Boston offers! Your turn now!, We have a new member in our Family!!!

Can't wait to "pop" the news ;), Happy Friday my dear Kiddoooooosss, I prepared these little ones just for you!!!! I MISS YOU &  I <3 YOU!!! Enjoy your Friday and God Bless You All!!!!, Good morning my dear Friends: As I mentioned to you before here is an update of our prospective place: Vanilla box, not even a single floor drain, 950 sqf. and not ready for a Restaurant. Between meetings with the Arquitect, Contractors, LL, etc. and City Hall..I am exhausted. Nothing is easy, I know, but do you think it is worth  to spend around $230,000.00 JUST IN CONSTRUCTION??!! Eventhough I do not want to have a fancy place, the amount to invest in this one its huge!! without taking in consideration that MEE wants to add a new paragraph in the lease stating: "If we need our place in five years... you have to leave it" You know what my friends... This is not like frying eggs!!! I feel terrible, eventhough we really have an strong support from the City Hall, this is crazzy and honestly, I do not know what to do. Any suggestions, any ideas, any help? My dear kiddos I am still working on this project BUT just in case you know of a restaurant that is on sale or closed already.... Would you please let me know? In the mean time and while I decide what to do, we keep selling SALSA on line and also doing some catering but I need to go back in business as soon as possible. These are not a good news right kiddos?, but do not panic, Mama King will take care of it. You... you just do not forget us...!!! GBUA., Absolutely beautiful!!! Cold...? Yes, but its worth it!!! http://t.co/QEH3X9o08d, This is what I really like from the snow, to see whites trees!! Beautiful!!! http://t.co/u3Duxdflqm, Happy Friday! This one's for you ;) http://t.co/ogvKn4ToFq, Good morning my dear friends..... In my way to City Hall!!! See you later my lovely Kiddoooooss!!!, So sorry my dear friends.

And tomorrow...MORE MEETINGS.... Sorry my dears,  but I promise I will keep you updated soon. I MISS YOU KIDDOOOOSSSS....  !!!!, Good mornings my dear Friends, today I am not going to share neither a tip or a recipe because I am in my way to meet with the contractor at our new little place. let see what happen.....

Our friends at Bon Appetite posted this soup recipe that's easy and tasty to try and I'm sharing it with you :) Happy cooking my dears!
 
Ingredients
 1/2 1-pound loaf sourdough bread, torn into 2-inch pieces (about 6 cups) 
1 bunch collard greens, center ribs and stems removed 
1 bunch Tuscan or other kale, center ribs and stems removed Kosher salt 
1/2 cup olive oil, divided, plus more for serving 
2 medium carrots, peeled, finely chopped
 2 celery stalks, finely chopped 
1 leek, white and pale-green parts only, chopped 
4 garlic cloves, chopped 
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, drained 
8 cups low-sodium vegetable broth 
3 15-ounce cans cannellini (white kidney) beans, rinsed 
4 sprigs thyme 
1 sprig marjoram or oregano 
1 bay leaf Freshly ground black pepper 
Shaved Parmesan (for serving)
 
Preparation
 Scatter bread on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Let stand at room temperature to slightly dry out, about 2 hours. Working in batches, cook collards and kale separately in a large pot of boiling salted water until slightly softened, about 3 minutes per batch. Rinse to cool. 

Squeeze out excess water; roughly chop. Set aside. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, and leek; stir often until softened, 8-10 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, crushing with your hands as you add them. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is evaporated and tomatoes begin to stick to the bottom of the pot, 10-15 minutes. 

Add broth, beans, thyme, marjoram, bay leaf, and reserved greens; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors meld and soup thickens slightly, 40-50 minutes. 

DO AHEAD: Soup can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool slightly; chill until cold. Cover and keep chilled. Reheat before continuing. Store bread airtight at room temperature. 

Just before serving, gently stir bread and 1/4 cup oil into soup. Divide among bowls, top with Parmesan, and drizzle with oil., Hi kiddos, how are you?! I don't know if you are aware that in Mexico we have rompope, which is like eggnogg. Well today I'm going to share the recipe so you can try it...specially on cold days like today!

Here we go:

INGREDIENTS
-2 cups of rum
-6 cups of milk
-3 cups of sugar
-6 pieces of cloves
-2 sticks of cinnamon
-1/2 cup of blended almonds
-15 egg yolks (the yellow part)
-ground nutmeg to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
In a small bowl place the rum, cloves and cinnamon to rest for a whole day (don't cheat!). The next day, cook the milk with the sugar and add the almonds. Cook everything in a very low heat for a few minutes, let it warm up only. Remove from the heat and put it aside.

In another bowl beat the yolks until they've foamed and add the cooked milk in slowly. Fold in everything and return again to the bowl then the stove, continuing to stir constantly for 10 minutes.

Remove the cloves and the cinnamon sticks from the rum and pour the rum into the cooking milk mixture. Be sure to stir it until boiling. Remove from the heat after boiling and let it cool.

Once it's ready to serve sprinkle the tops with the ground nutmeg, be careful with the sprinkling as nutmeg has a strong flavor as well!

I'm pretty sure you will looooove our rompope! Let me know how it turns out ;)

Love you kiddooooos!, How was your Valentines Day my friends???? Wonderful!!!  Well, today 2/15,  I would like to invite you to share a little of the love that you received yesterday to those in need. Today we celebrate THE CHILDREN WITH CANCER'S DAY, so lets help Jimmy Trust Found, St. Jude Hospital, Emma Penpal Adventures, Childrens Hospital, MGH... Many many places that need our help... : (  Remember... We never know what is going to happen to us and today the little ones need our help!!!.... Thank you my friends, I know that you have a BIIIIIGGG HEEEAAARRRTTT!!!!! <3, There's no place like it, Boston you're my home! RT @BostonLogan: Hey @TodayShow, welcome to Boston! #todayinboston http://t.co/iwhyZ5wo, HAPPY VALENTINES DAY MY DEAR KIDDOOOOOSSS.... BE HAPPY ...  WE MISS YOU... WE LOVE YOU... !!!!!, A yummy dessert for a wonderful day!!! Enjoy Valentines Day Kiddooosss!!!, Set a nice wonderful table in a romantic atmosphere!!!!, My dear Friends: Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's Day and of course all of us want to be out and have a nice dinner with our sweeties!!! But what about the traffic, the waiting time, the crowds, babysitter perhaps...!!! 

Avoid all these inconveniences and have a nice, romantic supper in your home, with your love ones and why not, invite your children so they can also join in a lovely date. 

For this reason, here is a special entree for you my lovely couples!!! It is yummy, unexpensive and unique.... so lets get started:
PORK LOIN WHISKEY STYLE!!!

2 lbs. - pork loin
Salt & Black Pepper
1 - 5 oz. of your favorite whiskey
2 1/2 cups of milk
1 stick of margarine.

Instructions:
In a deep sauce pan start melting the margarine but be careful not to burn it. In the meantime, salt & pepper the meat to taste. 

When the margarine melts (clear golden color) place the pork over it and start browning it. Be careful and do not let the margarine burn. Once the meat is a kind of golden color on both sides, add the whiskey and the milk and let the pork cook on simmer until tender.

Once the meat is cooked take it out of the pan, set it in a big plate and slice it. Drain the gravy and if it is too light, boil it a little bit longer until brown. Once it's ready pour it over the pork. You can garnish the plate with some steamed veggies and a side of rice pilaf.

If you have kids share some Mac & Cheese! 

Get your favorite red wine, get some chocolate marshmallows and add a cherry on top of them,   light some nice candles, be romantic, enjoy the time....always with your sweeties. I bet it will be A LOT OF LOVE.... and a NICE DAY TO REMEMBER!!!! 

HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY MY DEAR KIDDOOOSSS - I <3 U!!!, Good morning my dear friends... Here is a good tip: Do you know that this little herb "OREGANO" has anti inflamatory effects?  It is a good antibiotic, and it also helps to destroy cancerogenic cells!!! Wonderful... So spread a pinch on your salads, soups, etc., make a tea out of it if you have a tomny ache, colic, cramps, etc.!!! Be healthy, live happy...I LOVE YOU!!!, Good Monday my dear Friends; since we are not in our little place any more, I am worried that you are not eating good healthy food. Due to this reason and trying to keep in contact with you, everyday I will give you a little tips or yummy and easy recipes that you can prepare at home, like this WHITE VEGGIES SOUP, specially good for this cold days. Lets start:Ingredients:
2 medium onions - sliced
2 white turnips - sliced
2 medium squaches - peeled and sliced
1/2 small coliflower (please only the little flowers)
olive oil, sea salt, pinch of oregano water, and pcs. of scallion to garnish.
Preparation:
 Put olive oil in a medium pot (medium heat) let the oil warm a little bit and then drop the onions, cook them for about 10 minutes. Add the rest of the veggies with the oregano, cover the pot and let them cook until tender (20 minutes aprox), stirring once in a while. If it is necessary, add a little bit of water.
Once all the veggies are cooked blend them with some water. Once is blended pour the mix into the pot again and add salt to taste. Remember...you do not want to make your cream to thin - or to thick ok?! bring the cream to boil and once is ready garnish it with pcs. of scallion and ... Bon Apetite!!!

Remember I told you that I met all kind of people here? Well, this story is related to one of my favorite homeless persons. Mike, who I met since day one. He is a nice well educated fellow.  Unfortunately he is sick, he is an alcoholic and he has been in rehab for so many times. He used to get food from us almost every day. I used to call his attention very very hard and instead of him getting tired, he used to tell me "bonita chica (pretty girl :)) you can scream at me as much as you want but first, please give me salsa & chips ok!" One day, after he finished one of a hundred "vacations" as he used to call the rehabs, he came to the store with such a beautiful set of pink roses. God they were awesome. He came in so fast "JULIE MY LOVE" he screamed, "those are for you..put them in water and don't forget that I LOVE YOU!!!" Mike, I said, where did you get them from??? He told me: "I got them for you, just for you!!!" I could not believe what my eyes were seeing....and I was enjoying "my" roses <3. Suddenly my neighboor next door who owns the flower shop came running and screaming ... 
"Did you see him ....did you see him...??? HE STOLE MY WHOLE POT OF FLOWERS!!!" Oh oh, I said good bye flowers and I apologized to him.  I just laughed. God knows that I miss Mike!!!, Good morning my friends, just checking who is up and working already. Thank you my dear Anette!! We are getting ready as well and we are preparing the Guacamole....

Thank you kiddoooosss...see you tomorrow, enjoy the rest of your holiday...take care!!!, Did yoy get the message my dear fellows...LETS ALL KEEP WORKING TO MAKE OUT OF THIS A GREATER COUNTRY!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!, Good morning my friends: Congratulations today to Mr. Obama who will take possession on his second term, we are celebrating MLK' Day, out little hearts are broken because of the PATS, we have the BEST BURRITOS IN BOSTON and, YES.. we are open today!!!! A lot of mixed emotions!  SEE YOU LATER KIDDOOOOOSSS!!!, We've got it ready and people are already ordering it, you know what I mean, come before it's gooone...chorizo, shhhhh! Get yours!, So keep it coming my dears! We've got food and our coffees ready ;)!, Good nice sunny Friday my friends. Today I will talk about this wonderful couple that I met in our place with two little daughters. 

Every time they had to take their oldest little daughter that had 2-3 years in those days to her doctors appointment, they stopped in the store because they liked our beef tacos. I always used to play with this little one calling her "my little princess". 

First the visit was like every three months, then every two, then a month, then my little princess was hospitalized. I knew she was sick but I did not want to ask or probably know what was going on. Time passed by and her Dad stopped by to let me know about her medical situation. She is getting better, she sends you hughs, she is happy, etc... I always talked to him because her Mom was with her all the time. 

One day, when I got to the store, here they were with my little princess. I never realized how long time passed by, the only thing I knew was that I was seeing my baby, she was in my arms and she was happy  :)

Then, on a Monday, her Dad stopped by. I said "Hi my Friend, too long no see you... How is my little princess?"

I remember he took my hand, he looked straight to my eyes and told me, "thank you, thank you, thank you for all the love you gave her, thank you because she was really happy when she saw you. Thank you for your support, we are very grateful to you. I am going to pick her up and my wife is with her." 

I said "wow, congratulations... She is better now??!!!" He said, "no, she lost her battle against cancer and passed away yesterday."  

Still today, I miss my little princess but I know that she is laughing and enjoying her new lovely life with God and we were blessed to have her <3., Hi my friends, let me tell you one of our anecdotes...... We were at our little place, a Saturday morning in 2007. 

Here, this good looking, well dressed, educated gentleman, came in and asked me for some tacos with a little guacamole. In the meantime he was eating I gave him a taste of this, a taste of that, and kept chating. 

Bess, my daughter, was very enthusiastic talking to him (so was I), and he said... One of this days "I will cook for YOU" !!! I was like OMG, He said FOR ME!!!! So I told him... "Do you think that I am going to believe that YOU cook!!?? With these beautiful hands of yours and your wonderful clothes... Do you really think I will believe that you know how to do it...???" 

We were laughing and a few minutes later, this little boy about 8 years-old then came into the store saying, "Dad, lets go! Are you eating again?!" Bess and I looked at the little boy and then at this handsome gentleman, then  we looked at each other again...OH-OH...married... :( 

Exactly the next morning Bess was watching a reality show with some famous stars and she started screaming. "MOM..MOM...COME HERE!" So, I run into her room and I said what is it, what happened? She was freaking out looking at the TV. "Look who's there!!!" she said. I said, "God is our married handsome customer!!!" and she said... "Yeah... Guess who he is?! TODD ENGLISH!" 

About a month later, someone came into the business shouting and asking, "who is the little Mexican woman?!" I thought, oh my God what happened??? I told the man it had to be me and he said to look at the interview! He gave a magazine of Stuff @ Night and there he was. Mr. English talking about good food in Boston and mentioning our little taco/burrito shop inside the gas station. 

One of the Best Chefs in Mass.,
he kept comming and I've never told him that I know what he does... Except that he is a nice, wonderful, easy going person,  and he is not our customer BUT OUR FRIEND!!! 

My dear Friend Todd YOU ARE THE BEST... GOD BLESS YOU!!! <3, Our little friend Ana, stopped by with her Mom Kathy, and she told me... "Julie why do you gave to move??" Me: "Such is life Baby, we have to." Ana: "I have a great idea, you can move to our house and make it easy for us to see you!!!" Lovely :) !!!, My dears we've been getting such beautiful messages from you regarding our closing at the gas station, we love you all so much, thank you <3, Good cold morning my friends: Here thinking about my memories in my little place.... I remember my first day, just thinking... Now, We are in Boston ...AND IN A GAS STATION...???!!! Well I thought... Lets make it work!! And after more than six years of extremely hard work, in which my Daughter and employees have been a main part of it, we became "THE BEST BURRITOS IN BOSTON", THE BEST AUTHENTIC HOMEMADE MEXICAN FOOD!! And do you know our secret to reach this goal besides fresh quality ingredients, cleaning, a family atmosphere, education, etc..

So many blessings, we're lucky to share these happy times with you :), Querida Familia, queridos amigos: Ya regresamos y con la novedad que nos negaron el permiso. Don dinero habl√≥ y convenci√≥. Mi Abogado nos defendi√≥ muy bi√®n, se sentia mucha tensi√≥n, estuvo muy re√±ido PARA ELLOS porque hab√≠a m√°s apoyo mio que de ellos y a√∫n as√≠ perdimos.  Dieron excusas idiotas no creibles, y lo negaron. Me siento triste? S√≠ lo estoy!!, y tal vez no sea una rica americana de Beacon Hill, pero lo que NO TIENEN ELLOS... LO TENGO YO!!! Una hija bell√≠sima sentada y apoyandome a mi derecha, unos amigos incodicionables que dejaron todo por estar con nosotras, unos Clientes tan insuperables que hablaron de mi hija, de mi familia, de nuestra cultura, educaci√≥n y negocio de una manera tan hermosa que me hicieron agradecerle a mi Dios lo bello que ha sido conmigo. Mi Familia y amigos Mexicanos, extraordinarios, sus comentarios me dan fuerza para seguir en la lucha y mi Madre, con las bendiciones y oraciones que llegan directito con la luz de Dios. TODO ESTO MIS AMIGOS... NO TIENE PRECIO Y LES AGRADEZCO A TODOS su amistad, apoyo y amor. Que sigue....?? Sentirme tristita un poquito, mirar al cielo...Y VOLVERME A LEVANTAR, pero cuidense porque ahi vengo y cada vez m√°s fuerte con AYUDA DE MI DIOS.... Gracias, los <3 <3 <3 mucho.!!!, We are back my friends... What happened... The permit was denied... How do I feel: frustated because it is unbelievable that this morning I had the "suggestion" to withdraw my application again because the permit was not going to be issued (before the hearing!!).

The opposition gave some reasons I think were over emphasized to deny us, and at the end they were very happy. But you now what my friends, I might lose a battle but not the war. At the end I was the most happiest person in the whole world. Because somehow I won.  

They might be rich and they might afford a "wealthy" lawyer who also lives in Beacon Hill, but to have your presence at the meeting, to have your support, to feel your love and to hear such wonderful comments about me, my daughter and my business- that my friends IS PRICELESS!!! 

In this world there will always exist the good and the bad and God gives us strenght to deal with it. Thank you my friends,  this is not the end and we are in GOD'S HANDS...THANK YOU FOR BEING OUR FRIENDS... GOD BLESS YOU ALL...!!!! ... <3... Julie & Bess, Good morning my Friends: I will be honest I HAVE A NUT IN MY STOMACH!!! Today is our big day and we are in our way to City Hall. What is going to happened... Only God knows but I am confident that everything will be ok. Specially because He knows what is the best for us. Thanks you my friends for your prayers, your support and specially your love.LETS KEEP GOING... TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE IT...!!!! SEE YOU LATER....!!!! <3...<3...<3, In case you don't receive our emails my friends, please read here: http://conta.cc/J9zv5Y, Good Monday my friends: tomorrow is our BIG DAY!!! ZBA Hearing - 11:00 am - 8 th floor, City Hall. Just in case you would like to join us - I would LOVE to see you there!

We will meet with our lawyer this morning to get everything ready for tomorrow. Therefore, we will open at 3:00 pm TODAY. 

Thank you for your comprehension and support. Please my friends, if you can take 15 minutes to join us- come. GBUA!, Thats right ;)!, HAPPY HAPPY 5 DE MAYO SATURDAY MY FRIENDS ...!!! Dont forget that today we have a special celebration menu!!!! Come and enjoy our AUTHENTIC TRADITIONAL TACOS ...... and so forth......!!!! See you later kiddos... <3 VIVA PUEBLA... VIVA MEXICO ...!!!!! <3, going to bed! See you tomorrow!!! https://www.facebook.com/events/371519129551206/, null, got some Sox tickets from our friend Chris, thank you :)!!!, My friends..... THANK YOU FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY...!!! FOOD IS GONE.... BUT ....Tomorrow 5 de Mayo we will be celebrating our Battle of Puebla and we will be serving TACOS. We will honor Puebla, home of the MOLE POBLANO with our unique and authentic specialty. And our TRADITIONAL BEEF tacos that we typically have for caterings only. It's worth it to try them! Don't miss our 5 de Mayo celebration!, IT'S ALL ABOUT MEXICO!!!! My dear friends: As Mexican, I feel so proud that another country takes the time to celebrate "5 de Mayo" and in the US it's a HUUUGE CELEBRATION :) !!! Thanks a lot for this. But, let me tell you that "5 de Mayo" is not our Independence Day or our Revolution Day. 

To make a big and interesting story short, in 5 de Mayo we celebrate "LA BATALLA DE PUEBLA" ( the city of Puebla battle). What does this mean? 7 kids, 13 to 16 years-old, that belonged to Mexico's Military College were part of the battle in Puebla against France. These kids gave their life defending Mexico and helped win the battle. For this reason we honor them on this date. In Mexico a ceremony takes place at their monument. 

A lot of people think that Mexicans are all still wearing hats and riding horses. But the truth is that Mexico is a productive country that exports produce, coffee, chocolate, beer (!), etc, and we are becoming a first world country. Mexico offers different industrial and touristic opportunities. Home of the richest man in the world. Home of America's Queen Virgin of Guadalupe. Home of millions of wonderful Mexican people! 

I hope you learned something new today from my little lesson!!! You always have to keep learning  : ) !!! And we look forward to seeing you tomorrow to enjoy some dilicious traditional TACOS to celebrate this event !!!, HAPPY HAPPY FRIDAY MY FRIENDS: ..... CHORIZO IS R E A D Y ...!!!!  please dont miss it... 30 lbs and it wont last long ...... :(  see you later....!!!, Happy because it was an excellent lunch! Thank you fellows!!!!

Please join us next Tuesday, we need bodies, we need hands raised, we need to fill up the City Hall room # 809 at 11:00 am. You probably will lose 30 minutes of your time but if we dont get the variance permit we will lose our business to keep surviving!!! You are more than welcome to bring your friends, family, coworkers, etc. Thank you my friends... With your support...
