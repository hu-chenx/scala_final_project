Thanks to everyone who has stopped by, waved, written us on FB, given us the thumbs-up., Congrats to the entire team at Tres Gatos, our beloved sister restaurant, for being included on this prestigious list! Great job, Gatos!, Chefs are busy testing their dishes, designers are finishing up, servers are reading up on (and tasting) wine -- we're raring to go!, It's Friday, and the CSC team is busy with final touches: hanging decorative panels, cutting boards, etc on the walls, adjusting the height of lights, putting in dimmers, polishing our tables and silverware, laying out the dining room, etc. The kitchen crew treated us to our first batch of house made pasta, and today, our first (massive) wine delivery arrives. We'll be cooking, tasting and training over the weekend, and will open our doors to you ASAP. Have a great weekend!, Yes, it's true, the chefs took a solemn vow last night (over a few cans of Notch session brew, in our freshly mopped dining room which now has TABLES) to begin cooking -- in the Cafe's kitchen -- today. That's a pretty big milestone. Only one more inspection to go!, null, An eventful week: overshelves in the kitchen got hung, wall finishes are progressing, benches got installed in the dining room, the chef is almost finished with our starting menu, and this weekend, the whole place will get a deep cleaning. We plan to be open very soon; thanks again for all of your interest and support!, If opening a restaurant is a marathon, we can see the finish line! Wall treatments are going up, stain and poly is down on the floor, more lighting fixtures go up today, plumber is hooking up gas to our kitchen equipment, and staff training is underway. We can't announce an exact date, but stay tuned, you'll hear it first here., At the Cafe these days, work starts very early and ends very late. This week, new oak floors are being laid, a new ceiling is being hung, ductwork for the A/C is going in, chairs and final finishes are being chosen, and lots of coffee is being consumed...Thanks to all of our friends, families and well-wishers for your encouragement! We're almost there., Nothing changes a room like paint, and the Cafe now has its first coat! Ready to sand and stain floors, hang lights, install speakers, etc. etc. We're getting close, please stay tuned!, Our marathon wine tasting ended today; now it's time to review notes, take some second (or third) tastes, then start finalizing the list. Also, the dining room is now primed and ready for a first coat of paint tomorrow!, Thanks to the Improper and Jacqueline Houton for featuring this lasagna dish from chef Brian Rae's upcoming menu. Our pasta extruder arrives tomorrow! , The week is off to a good start, with a lot of equipment arriving, including ovens and a pasta cooker! Also, making final decisions on logo, lighting and paint colors. Starting to look like a restaurant!, We tasted more great wines today, from Corsica to Sicily, and the builders made great progress on the space: our new hood was installed, the skylight went in, and a handsome blue epoxy floor was put down in the basement. Next week, lots of equipment arrives, and we continue with wine-tasting. Enjoy the summery weekend, everyone, and thanks for following our progress. We can't wait to open our doors!, Well, we tasted everything from Italian Bubbles to a Ferrari today, we tasted north and south, high and low, and even took a side trip to Portugal. If we get bored between now and the opening, maybe we'll make a collage of all of these beautiful labels..., 2nd day of wine tasting, palates and brains a little weary, but we're very excited about the prospect of creating a wine list like no other in JP., Wine tasting for CSC began in earnest today, with some great wines from Italy (including Sicily), Greece and Lebanon. Tastings continue throughout the week and into next, as we put our heads and palates together to create a truly distinctive list that focuses on Italy but incorporates outstanding wines from around the Mediterranean., Thanks to Kara Baskin and the Boston Globe for sharing this great bit of news regarding our sous chef. We're thrilled to work with Stephen and look forward to sharing more updates and photos this week. , A busy week at the Cafe: new walls are going up, ductwork being installed for a new convection oven for house made breads, etc, sound system being assembled (will play everything from records to Rhapsody), coffee tasting with the fine folks at Fazenda, and wine tastings scheduled for next week. And welcome our GM, Alex Gang, a Bistro du Midi alum!, You know you're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel when you start picking plates and glasses! Add in the dreamy fall weather, and the prospect of wine tastings in the near future, and team CSC is feeling pretty happy today., We haven't been posting a lot of pictures, but a lot is going on in the space. Plumbing is almost done, rewiring is underway, and design work continues. Thanks for staying tuned!, Thanks to Eater and Rachel Leah Blumenthal for including Centre Street Cafe in this list of Boston's Most Anticipated Fall Restaurant Openings!

Gracias!, Thanks to Christopher Hughes and Boston Magazine for this great piece announcing our head chef, Brian Rae, who's been chef de cuisine at Rialto for the past five years. We couldn't be more thrilled to have Brian on board. , We thought it was time for another little album to show our progress. You'll see the bones of our new w/c accessible bathroom, for starters. And one little detail we're pretty excited about: there's a skylight in the bathroom ceiling that gives you a view of a skylight in the roof, meaning you can see blue sky from the bathroom. We think this may be a first in Boston!, Still going through a lot of old boxes, and finding some great stuff.. Not to be repetitive, but, wow, so much history here! Hopefully we can get Margie to laugh like this come fall!!, A sneak peak at what the new Centre Street dining room will look like, courtesy of our fabulous architects (Helios Design Group) and designers (Hamilton Hughes Design), who helped make Tres Gatos the beautiful place it is., One last look, framers come tomorrow... Now is the precipice between nostalgia and excitement. Knowing the truck stop breakfast will remain makes it only a little easier. #thankyouoldfriend, We thought anyone interested in how a restaurant comes into being might like to see how our project unfolds. This album gives you an idea of what demolition looks like: not pretty, but necessary in order to bring in a new kitchen and a new look., null, The shape of things to come!, We are really excited to get to work! Stay tuned here for updates, and of course we welcome all thoughts and suggestions.. After celebrating JP Porchfest at Gatos today, our love for this neighborhood is at a new all-time high (which happens pretty regularly...)       :), We are closing for renovations on June 30th. We will be open regular hours that day and that night we will be serving a special menu with live music so come on down. Regular hours every day until then. Thank you all for your love over the years, we look forward to re-opening in the fall.)
