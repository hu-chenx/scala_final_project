List(Hello CSS Fans!  We are excited to announce our partnership with Fairsted Kitchen in Brookline as we will be reopening soon as Frogmore Low Country Kitchen…like us on FB:

https://www.facebook.com/thefrogmore?fref=ts

Also, be sure to check out our article in the Boston Globe:

https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2015/05/09/tables/wgWHSSJPzoed3mAo6SyNSJ/story.html, null, Centre Street Sanctuary will be closed indefinitely.

Hi. This will come as a surprise to many of you, but Sanctuary's last day of operation was March 8th.  We are very proud of what we have accomplished and extremely proud to have served Jamaica Plain and beyond.
Our motto has always been "All Are Welcome" and you have done the same to us.
To be brief, we were heading in the right direction and ran out of time.  In October we turned a corner and moved on a great pathway to success, but the earlier losses were too great to carry us through to a point where we could be profitable.  Given our recent trends over the past few months, we would see gains by the beginning of 2016, but we ran out of sustainable cash.

We would like to thank you, our neighbors, our friends, and especially our wonderful staff for providing us with a memorable experience.  I am sure we will meet again in the not-to-distant future.

Truly,
