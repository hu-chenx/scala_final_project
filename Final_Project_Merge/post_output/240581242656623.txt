She truly was the best little girl in the world right up to the end. #harriet #harrietcarrotcake #cupcakes #cupcakestagram #cupcakelove Thank you #cummingsschoolofveterinarymedicine #adorablepets #villagevet #dogsofinstagram #southendbuttery, Funfetti Buttery Buns!

#Repost from @rescuepetsofbos ---We asked Rescue Pets of Boston book alumni, Tess, to proof the New Faces of the @southendbuttery finalists placards but she decided it would be more fun to try and eat the paper... Please JOIN US for our unveiling party this Wednesday the 24th from 6-9 to see our new photography highlighting local rescues. As always, our work is not only meant to inspire others to adopt but also to raise money for local shelters. There will be an amazing raffle, a book signing, and silent auction for a private dinner for 6 in your own home by the Buttery! 
We look forward to seeing you on Wednesday and as always thank you for your support of our projects and rescue animals everywhere! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Many varieties exist, consisting of different types of crumb with different flavours of icing (e.g., mint, peanut butter) and different types of chocolate.
