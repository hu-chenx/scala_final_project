David Shinney · Boston, Massachusetts
Start with the fact that Davio's has very creative Northern Italian Steak House food, all made in house with the freshest ingredients, sourced from the leading vendors in the marketplace. And by that, I mean in each individual location, up and down the eastern seaboard. The food presentations to each guest are well thought through and artistic. The guest service is professional and flawless in execution. It yeilds exceptionly high level guest satisfaction.

I attribute all the Davio's success, in all it's markets, to one source, the strategic, tactical and hands on leadership of Owner, Steve DiFillippo. He is driven to make his restaurants leaders in all his markets, yet he is not a boorish ,Type A personality but accomplishes his goals in a professional, gentlemanly manner.

Do yourself a favor and read his book, "It's All About the Guest" Your restaurant will potentially excel if you adopt the precepts, with supporting practical examples, into your start up and operation. It's virtually a Bible. If you're not in the business, simple some one who dines ouy, see the underlying reasons for trying Davio's. As Arnold says, "I'll (you'll) be back"

These are just a couple of thoughts. I could go on...

Here is his recipe to try at home this Thanksgiving!
Recipe:
Baked Acorn Squash
2 tablespoons butter, plus more for surface
2 medium acorn squash (about 1 1/2 pounds each)
Coarse salt and ground pepper
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Generously butter a rimmed baking sheet.
2. Halve squash crosswise. Scoop out seeds; discard. Slice a small piece off bottom of each squash half just enough to level.
3. Set squash halves, scooped sides down, on prepared sheet. Bake until golden, 20 minutes. Turn squash; prick insides all over with a fork. Divide 2 tablespoons butter and sugar among halves; season with salt and pepper. Continue to bake until flesh is easily pierced with the tip of a paring knife, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm., What's #OpenInBOS on Thanksgiving?

3.	2 tablespoons siracha sauce 
4.	1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
5.	1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
6.	3 dozen medium/large oysters, like Island Creek 
7.	2 tablespoons of fresh parsley

1. Light a grill. In a food processor, pulse the parsley, butter and tarragon with the hot sauce, salt and pepper until blended. Transfer the tarragon butter to a sheet of plastic wrap and roll it into a 2-inch-thick log. Refrigerate the butter until slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Slice the butter into 36 pats. (The tarragon butter can be refrigerated for  5 days) 

2. Place the oysters on the hot grill, flat-side up. Cover the grill and cook until the oysters open, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the oysters to a platter, trying to keep the liquor inside. Quickly remove the top shells and loosen the oysters from the bottom shells. Top each oyster with a pat of tarragon butter and return the oysters to the grill. Cover the grill and cook until the butter is mostly melted and the oysters are hot, about 1 minute. Serve right away.
