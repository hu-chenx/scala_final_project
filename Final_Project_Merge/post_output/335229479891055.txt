List(null, null, A few more drinks to be had for our final farewell..... 

These past two weeks have been superb, albeit bitter sweet. We"re so grateful to our fabulous customers! 

We offer our final words of wisdom: appreciate what you"ve got while you"ve still got it. 

Now on to the next act....., A heartfelt THANK YOU to all of our patrons over the years, especially our neighborhood regulars. We appreciate your business and we will miss you!, It"s almost over......, Last chance for a last hoorah at ECG!!!  We're serving food and drinks until midnight or until we run out....whichever happens first!! It's worth a schlep through the snow!!!!!, Last Hell Night's coming up in t-minus 5 days....hope everyone's ready!!, Here is the small plate style Hell Night Menu. The last one. May add some last minute things as we see fit., Dear Friends,
After 30 years of delivering some of the biggest and boldest flavors in the northeast,  East Coast Grill‚Äôs is closing on Saturday January 23, 2016.
We have been very fortunate to serve at the helm of this revered and loved establishment for over 10 years. It is time to move on and explore new opportunities but we will all miss serving the loyal guests that have supported us faithfully for so long. This is a bittersweet moment for our team - the Cambridge community, particularly our neighbors in Inman Square, are very special and we are sad to say goodbye.
East Coast Grill is also loved by a very brave population known as ‚ÄúChili Heads‚Äù who flock to the restaurant‚Äôs regular Hell Nights to experience some of the spiciest dishes on the planet.
To honor the restaurant‚Äôs beloved chili heads, East Coast Grill will host one final Hell Night on Thursday January 21. Reservations are first come first serve and are available via opentable.com. Please continue to check this space for more special events and news. 
Thank you so much for all the great years!

We always keep a watchful eye on our Facebook and Twitter pages, and we've heard your concerns and frustrations about the Hell Night reservation process. 
 
With Hell Night and with everything we do in the restaurant, we always strive for excellence. Every year, we try to tweak the reservation process to make it easier and more efficient for you, our guests. And even after 27 years of business, we continue to grow and learn. With that in mind we ask you to please e-mail us any thoughts and suggestions on improving the system you may have to Robin Greenspan at ecgrill@aol.com. 
 
From our hearts, we are sorry that some of you had difficulty getting through to us. If you live in the Greater Boston area, a great way to participate in Hell Night is to  come and try to snag seats at the bar on the early side of the evening (5pm) or later side of the dinner rush (9pm and onwards).
 
We hope that you'll continue to try and make a reservation for our next Hell Night later in the year, and we hope to see you even before that at the East Coast Grill sometime in the very near future.
 
All our best, 
Chef Jason, Robin, James and the whole East Coast Grill family, Hell Night is Booked Solid! 49 minutes, 20 seconds. We will be posting cancellations here do kept your eyes open!!! Thanks!, Thank You To All you entered the Haiku Contest. Good Luck today!

You've got to have the will to want to do it, and the strive, and the dedication,"  William "Chopper" Young, who will be at ECG on December 7 for our Oyster Night, Rebecca, age 10, and Danny, age 8, review the ECG:

Rebecca, "ECG is a small, always crowded seafood restaurant.  It has a normal sized bar, small table groupings, and a reasonable sized "Lava Lounge."  The Lava Lounge has a fake volcano, and every once in a while it "erupts" showing flashing red lights.  It has a fairly small kitchen, and stairs to what I think is a storage room.  The kitchen is very loud.  Anna, our server tonight, is very peppy.  Jess, a server from the past, has a bunch of tattoos and is very nice and helpful.  For dinner I had fried shrimp and grilled corn.  The shrimp came with celery, blue cheese sauce, and spicy sauce, but you can order it without the spicy sauce if you don't like spicy foods.  It was very good, but it is not that big of a portion.  The grilled corn came with two pieces.  I ate one of them and it was delicious.  The second one was burned at the bottom, so I didn't eat it.  Even though I said a few negative things about the restaurant, ECG is an awesome restaurant for all ages, except maybe not for small babies because of all the noise."  4.5 out of 5 stars

Danny, "ECG may sound fancy and for adults, but it is also for kids too!  For kids they put plastic animals, palm trees and other stuff in their water.  Their service is really great.  They ask lots of questions so that they can make the food just the way you want it.  There is tons of foods, and I'm guessing it would take 50 - 70 kids to remember everything on the menu.  Also when you walk in there is a bar, and that bar is called the oyster bar.  There are about 10 - 20 tables to sit at."  4.5 out of 5 stars, two men and a macomber turnip, Gilligan's Island Theme + Bob Dylan, Christmas in the Heart songs added to the (mostly) Latin Brunch Music Mix!, big man, little fish, Beer Dinner Menu...!
