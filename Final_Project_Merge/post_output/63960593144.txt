"If you are looking for an amazing wedding photographer, you've found her! My husband and I had the absolute pleasure of working with Justine for both our engagement photos and our wedding day and we couldn't be happier with our decision! Justine conducted herself with such professionalism and poise and kept us on track during a very busy day. Most importantly though, we had such a BLAST with her! She had us laughing from start to finish and because of that, the photos are a true representation of us on the happiest day of our lives.
Justine, I can't thank you enough for the beautiful photographs. We will treasure them for years to come. I am already looking for excuses to book another photo shoot with you :) ", Here are some teasers from Kristina & Travis's engagement session!

Has your mom been hinting at wanting family photos? Would you partner love a boudoir session as a self-esteem booster? Has your brother been needing head shots for his new website? Contact me! <3 justine@justinejohnsonphotography.com, Hey, friends! Don't forget that I do GIFT CERTIFICATES!

The whole goal of these is to be unscripted, natural photos in your home -- I want to see an hour or two of your genuine, messy, happy daily life -- playing with toys in the livingroom, building a gingerbread house, cooking breakfast together, reading books in a blanket fort, crafting the best Lego tower... whatever is representative of your family! The only requirements are that you must live in Portland or within 10-15 minutes, you must have at least one child (ideally 2-3 youngish children), and you must be okay with me sharing the photos (on Facebook, my website, my blog, etc). E-mail me if you're interested! justine@justinejohnsonphotography.com, When I photograph your family, THIS is exactly the kind of candid, unscripted joy I aim to capture! <3 To book a shoot of your own, contact me at justine@justinejohnsonphotography.com !, It's time for Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday SPECIALS!!!

"I can't say enough good things about Justine! I found her online and I just loved her style! The thing that struck me the most is how HAPPY and COMFORTABLE people look in her pictures. My (now) husband and I are not the kind of people who love taking pictures or consider ourselves very photogenic- and that is exactly why we were drawn to Justine. I knew she would bring it out in us!!! Right away I knew she was chill, informative and competently non-judgmental! She was always on top of communicating with us and was full of information that was helpful to us. She is extremely approachable, flexible and professional. On our wedding day she and her assistant were totally on point. I loved the way our engagement pictures came out and our wedding teasers came out. I can't wait to see the full album of pictures from the wedding. I can't recommend her enough and I wish I lived closer because I would have her photograph my entire life if I could!!! LOVE HER!", Ashley & Ryan's very purple wedding is up on the blog today! <3

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/britni-ben-maternity-portland-maine-maternity-session-maine-maternity-photographer/, I got an AMAZING review on WeddingWire -- thank you so much, Anne & Kellen!!! <3

"Justine photographed my brother's wedding two years ago, and the photos were absolutely stunning. Having seen the work of other photographers compared to hers, it was clear to me that I absolutely needed to book her to do my wedding. As soon as I got engaged, she was the first vendor we contacted. Justine was an absolute pleasure to work with. She did a great job helping us first-time wedding planners out by recommending package options and timing to fit our needs and budget. Not only was she very professional and extremely attentive on the day itself, she was someone I think my husband and I would really like to hang out with. When she put some of our teasers up online just a few short days after the wedding, it reminded me exactly why I was so determined to hire her. She is more than just someone to take pictures of things happening and people you like on your wedding day. She is an artist - passionate about her work, and extremely talented. I highly recommend her!", Every once in a while, a bunch of us local photographers get together to network, socialize, and take photos of each other (since, you know, we're so rarely in front of the camera ourselves!). Here's some photos from one of those times. :)

"I cannot begin to express how amazing Justine Johnson is... but I will try! I found Justine while researching for wedding photographers . I went through SO many portfolios of local photographers and a lot of them were very good, but Justine's work just stood apart. She has such an amazing grasp on color and composition that just brings the images to life. The energy just radiates from her work, and that is definitely something we wanted for our wedding photos. My first meeting with Justine was at our engagement session (which was amazingly included in the price of our wedding package). Justine was awesome and met us on a weekend day (which she usually reserves for more important sessions) at our location of choice. She was just as excited as we were to be getting our engagement photos done. She was also excited that we brought along our dog, who is practically our child! She was so great through the whole session. We were nervous at first and thought we would have to pose in certain ways, but Justine had a way where we were relaxed and everything just came naturally. She didn't have us pose, but she had great ideas where to stand and how to interact with each other that would make for great shots. She also took the ideas we had for photos and made them great. She found spots at our location that we would have never thought to go to. Our engagement photos turned out amazing! So colorful and full of life. The perfect amount of candid shots and more structured photos. After seeing the beautiful engagement shots, I was way less stressed about the wedding photos. I knew I could just relax and let Justine do her thing and SHE DID! Every aspect of our wedding was photographed perfectly, from the photo booth her assistant ran, to our posed family shots, to the amazing candids at the reception, to the hilarious wedding party photos, to the intimate couples shoot we stole away to do after our "I dos." I could not recommend Justine any higher!", Christine & Chris's Cambridge engagement session is up on the blog! <3

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/amy-dan-engaged-portland-maine-engagement-session-portland-maine-engagement-photographer/, I just received a new review on WeddingWire -- thank you so much, Lindsay & Rob!! <3

 "Hiring Justine as our wedding photographer was an easy decision early in our wedding planning process. We were attracted to the use of color in her photos, and the general feeling of "fun" in her photos. From the first time I reached out to Justine inquiring on price and availability, I knew that she was the best choice for our wedding. We were planning our wedding from out of state, and Justine's prompt and friendly responses to my emails made me feel comfortable booking her without the opportunity to meet in person. The included engagement photo session was an added bonus, and really helped us feel more comfortable during portraits on our wedding day. Justine and her assistant Devon arrived on time on the day of the wedding, and immediately got to work. They were flexible throughout the day, and we even able to stay an extra hour to capture some additional photos of the party. The photos that we received for our wedding are fantastic, and really show the casual and colorful style that I was attracted to in looking at her photos. Justine captured all of my requested family portraits, but the true star are the candid shots. There were so many small moments caught on camera, and they truly illustrate the feelings of our day. Every photo that Justine delivered makes me smile, and brings me back to the wedding day. I have gotten so many compliments on our photos. I can't thank Justine enough for how well she was able to preserve the memories of our wedding day. I highly recommend Justine!", In case you're curious... here's one of my teasers from my boudoir session today! Photo taken by the AMAZING Jenn of Adore by darling, hair & makeup by the incredible Jessica Candage Hair & Makeup Artistry! <3, Heading to Adore by darling for my OWN boudoir session this morning!!!

Thank you, Meghan & Mandeep!! <3

"Justine and her team were great to work with. My husband and I searched extensively for an affordably priced photographer for our wedding day in Boston (P.S. there aren't any)! Justine had done the photography at a friend's wedding so I knew her work was amazing. Imagine our surprise when she told us she had no problem coming down from Maine to shoot our entire wedding day!

We had a long and involved wedding day that started at city hall, moved to a luncheon, and was capped off by an evening reception. Justine and her team didn't batt an eye, showed up promptly at each venue, and hit the perfect balance of cool professionalism (got all of the requisite "family" pictures) and "wow - you're photographer was so great I barely noticed she was there."

The finished product was simply awesome. We wanted to capture the more candid and relaxed moments and Justine did just that. We could not be happier with the pictures.

Justine is wonderful to work with. She's fun and easy going, and really seems to love what she does. Her assistants are hilarious and bring a great energy and enthusiasm with them. I would HIGHLY recommend her and her team!", Just received a new review on WeddingWire -- thank you SO MUCH, Annemarie & Kumara! <3

"We searched high and low for a wedding photographer with a style that complimented ours (and fit in our budget)! Her photos were so colorful and bright- they simply exuded joy. Once we spoke to Justine the deal was sealed. She was so sweet and seemed to completely "get" us. Also, we found out that our wedding venue was on her list of dream venues; she offered us a killer discount (on top of already stellar prices)! When we met up with her for our free engagement shoot we were immediately put at ease by her warm and genuine personality. We were so nervous about the PDA involved in the shoot, and by the end we were having so much fun! We received "teasers" very quickly! Justine was very good about communicating when the photos would be ready. The photos were absolutely gorgeous; they were so vibrant and fun! We couldn't stop looking at them. We were able to download the digital files (NO ONE else we talked to did that). We knew we would be in good hands on our wedding day. A number of emails were exchanged prior to the wedding day to make sure we were all on the same page re: special photos, formal shots, etc. Justine was always very quick to respond and was extremely thorough. On our wedding day Justine and her staff were very professional, friendly, and efficient. My husband and I had underestimated the time we would need for the day, and Justine was more than willing to accommodate extra time (at a very reasonable rate). Our whole experience had been wonderful, and we hadn't even seen the final product yet! Like our engagement photos, we received teasers SO quickly! We even received our final photos in enough time to share them with our families over the holidays, which was wonderful. The photos were absolutely perfect and we could not be happier with them. There is nothing more moving than seeing your wedding day through the lens of someone so gifted. We were so lucky to have found Justine. If you are reading this review, hire this woman! You won't regret it!", Just (finally!) updated the "Kind Words" section of my website, where you can see reviews from past couples. Check it out! <3

Reading is sexy!, FLASHBACK FRIDAY! Jessica & Tom borrowed their friend's antique car for part of their wedding day, and I couldn't resist getting some bridal shots of Jessica with it!, FLASHBACK FRIDAY! One of my favorite first dance photos ever from Kaitlin & Taryn's wedding -- the sun shone through the window just right, illuminating only the two of them! <3, FLASHBACK FRIDAY!

These are from Jasmine & Brian's Boston wedding... she had beautiful, delicate, white shoes!, If you needed more of a reason to do a boudoir session (aside from it being SO MUCH FREAKING FUN), just take it from this recent boudoir client who just received her images: "I've never seen photos of me that look so incredible, beautiful, confident, sexy, and fabulous and that is what I see in the images below!" <3, Do I know anyone who works in The White House who could get us on a West Wing tour when we visit in April? Because... that would pretty much make my entire life. HUGE discount or something awesome & free for anyone who could help!, Hi friends!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/598959850236456/, I just got a new review on WeddingWire! Thank you so much, Hillary & Mike! <3

"Justine photographed our rehearsal dinner and wedding ceremony and reception, and we were incredibly grateful to have had her! I would wholeheartedly recommend her without any hesitation. When I first started looking for wedding photographers, I was dismayed by how many photographers required you to pay for an entire day. At that stage in the planning process, we simply couldn't commit to paying someone for the entire day. Thank goodness for Justine! Her pricing structure was so much more flexible than all the others. I think we initially booked her for 3 hours but we were able to extend a couple hours once we knew we had the budget. She was incredibly flexible about all of it! Of all the photographers I contacted, she was also the most responsive, friendly, and personal in her e-mail. We weren't able to meet in person because we were living in another state, but her personality was evident through her e-mails. I could tell that she was enthusiastic and genuine, and I felt comfortable booking her without actually meeting her. Throughout the planning process, Justine was incredibly responsive to my e-mails and was so organized, flexible, and friendly. When we finally met in person, I was immediately comfortable around her. It did not feel like the first time we met at all! During our wedding events, Justine was professional yet warm and friendly. I think everyone felt at ease around her. Justine also provided a photo booth for us, which our guests loved. We were very pleased with the quantity and quality of our photos and will definitely book Justine again for other photo sessions if we're back in the same geographic location again! We would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding photographer. Justine is a talented photographer with a reasonable pricing structure, but she is also enthusiastic, friendly, flexible, responsive, and the type of person you simply feel at ease around and who inspires your confidence!", This is definitely the "busy season" for people booking photographers -- 2015 is booking up and I'm getting inquiries for 2016 now!

"From our engagement photos to our wedding day, Justine Johnson Photography provided an amazing experience. The bubbly personality of Justine, along with her professionalism, caring nature & creativity provided an overall happy & pleasant experience for my husband & I! As a bride of a destination wedding, I was so thankful for Justine's helpful approach to our many questions. She was quick to respond to emails & very attentive. Following our photo sessions with Justine, she provided all photos in a user-friendly online gallery. This was so helpful when sharing with family & friends. All in all, our engagement & wedding photos were beautiful! My husband & I are beyond thrilled with the end product & we would definitely recommend Justine Johnson Photography as a wedding photographer or for your family portraits!", CYBER MONDAY SALE!!!

http://www.tipsycones.com/, Won't be at the computer much today BUT wanted to let you know that I have FOUR sets of teasers coming your way this week! Woohoo! <3, Just booked a September 2015 wedding at the Red Lion Inn in Cohasset, MA! Yipeee! <3, I'm looking for a volunteer for a shoot! I am partnering with Simply Bridal and will be borrowing one of their wedding dresses for the shoot, so the theme is BRIDAL. Other than that there are NO requirements -- you can be married or single, any age, any level of experience (including NO experience!), etc. I'm only looking for ONE volunteer. You must be in the Portland area or willing to travel. This is a totally FREE shoot but you will need to sign a model release allowing the photos to be used anywhere online, including being submitted to other blogs/sites and potentially used on Simply Bridal's website. This will be done DURING THE WINTER so you must be okay with cold weather and/or snow! CONTACT ME with some info about yourself & a photo (a simple headshot is fine) if you're interested! justine@justinejohnsonphotography.com, null, "Villains and plots and enemies are simple things to me.

"Justine was the first vendor I hired. She was actually the first photographer I even looked at - but even after looking at dozens of other photographer's websites, her photos stuck with me. She was incredibly gracious and flexible trying to find a package that worked into our budget, and was so incredible sweet. We unfortunately weren't able to coordinate a meeting beforehand (I live in NYC), but she was responsive and quick to answer all my questions and was sure to check in as the date approached! She (and her assistant and second shooter) were just so COOL and easy to work with. So many of the guests commented on how they seemed to just pop out of nowhere at exactly the right times! They made sure the formal photos were organized and speedy, and got every single shot we could have hoped for. Her style was exactly what I wanted - she caught all the little moments, the important moments, and really captured the fun of the entire night. And the amount of photos she gave us was insane! So many, and they were all perfect. I could not be happier and am so glad I went with my gut and booked her. :) Will definitely recommend in the future. Yay!!", null, I e-mailed this link to many of you, but if you've worked with me in the past (ESPECIALLY if you worked with me in 2013/2014), I'd LOVE it if you would take my CLIENT SATISFACTION SURVEY!

Thank you SO MUCH, Ellen & Larry! <3

"Justine was the very first vendor that we booked for our wedding and we couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. We found Justine on A Practical Wedding and immediately knew that we wanted for her to come to our backyard celebration in Vermont. Justine's portfolio showed more than just the event taking place; it showed the emotion behind the event, the connections, the joy. True to her word, Justine was a photo ninja at our wedding and her photos from the day accurately convey the mood from our wedding in a way that no other photos have captured. Her brilliant use of color and contrast make her style unique and memorable. The biggest compliment I can pay to Justine is that we had another professional photographer attending our wedding as a guest. At the start of the wedding, our guest was taking a ton of photos, until she realized that Justine was already in place to capture the very moments she was going for. By the end of the night, our guest was having a fantastic time, with her camera nowhere to be found, which is exactly what we were hoping for. Looking through our wedding photos I have laughed, cried, and been astonished at the details Justine was able to capture. I can truly say that hiring Justine was one of the best decisions we made.", NEWBORN & BABY SHOOT SPECIAL!!!

http://www.gofundme.com/enz2qk, Taking today off to celebrate (and photograph) my sister-in-law Rebecca's wedding!!! Today is her and her fiance's 10-year anniversary and the wedding is going to be AMAZING!!!!! <3, If you can, take a moment to check out this page! It's in support of my brother's Boston terrier, Waaffi. They just found out that the mysterious pain he's been feeling in his shoulder/legs for the past few months is from a large tumor on his spinal cord. The MRI hasn't been able to tell the doctors if it's cancerous or not, but between a huge bill to diagnose him and the upcoming bill for his surgery, their payments are piling up and credit cards are maxed. I know how awful I'd feel if this was our pup in the same position!

If you're able to donate, anything would help. If you donate $100 or more, e-mail me proof and you'll receive a 1-hour shoot of your choice (couples, maternity, baby, head shots, boudoir, etc!). This is $200 off my normal pricing -- I just want to see Waaffi get better!

http://www.gofundme.com/enz2qk, It's only 1pm and I've already finished up one wedding and edited & delivered FIVE photo shoots! I'm not totally sure, but I thiiiiink I'm on a roll. ;), Heading down to Rockport, MA for a boudoir session this morning! <3, Heading to Monmouth, Maine for Jenn & Scott's backyard wedding!!! Loving this autumn smell in the air! <3, Taking today off to spend with my husband and celebrate our FIVE YEAR wedding anniversary!!! Can't even believe it. Five years ago today we were out on Long Island, Maine, getting ready to spend the day celebrating with our family and friends. It was lightly misting outside, you could smell the sea breeze, and from my upstairs perch (where I had my hair & makeup done), I could hear the chatter of our closest friends and family mingling. Completely surreal. Today we're going to eat lots of food and run around outside with the pup! Yipee! Have an awesome day, y'all! <3, Edited and delivered FIVE shoots today which means I am officially done with the computer for the day before my eyeballs roll out of my head. ;), Just so y'all know... I am totally up for bartering! Things I am primarily looking for would be tattoo work, home improvement/repair, hotel accommodations, airfare, spa and/or hair services, massage, or personal training... but if you have something to offer, don't hesitate to ask!!! <3, null, Just so y'all know... I am totally up for bartering!

I remember your wedding like it was just yesterday... so full of absolute joy. Have an amazing day! <3, Just so y'all know... I am totally up for bartering! Things I am primarily looking for would be tattoo work, home improvement/repair, hotel accommodations, airfare, or personal training... but if you have something to offer, don't hesitate to ask!!! <3, Heading to Odiorne Point State Park in Rye, NH this evening for Emily & Adam's engagement session! <3, Heading to York Beach this afternoon for Casey's headshot session! :D, BEFORE & AFTER! This shot is from Courtney's boudoir session! I loved this pose and it didn't need much help -- all I did was brighten it up and up the contrast a wee bit, and smoothed out her armpit and face slightly. Done!, BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Lianna & Katy's wedding, of the gorgeous Lianna! I boosted the brightness and contrast to help along the color of the grass and beautiful purple flowers behind her, and I cropped in a bit so she could truly be the center of attention. Bam!, BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Kaitlin & Taryn's engagement session! I bumped up the brightness and contrast a bit to show off the vibrancy of not only their outfits but the ivy as well. I also cropped the pipe out since I found it distracting. And now this is one of my favorite shots ever (but that's because of how freaking cute these two are!)., BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Kayla & Greg's engagement session. This shot SOOC (straight out of camera) is pretty awesome, but I had a few tweaks to make. I brightened and upped the contrast, which is fairly standard for me. I also increased the cool tones just a bit. Most of all, I removed the distracting sign and car in the background so I could truly focus on the moment of them walking along the beach together!, BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Katie's senior session. I was really thrilled with the SOOC (straight out of camera) shots from this session... the lighting was just PERFECT! So I really just straightened it the tiniest bit and bumped brightness/contrast juuust slightly and it's ready to go!, BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Justine & Scott's wedding. It didn't need much -- all I wanted to focus on was their goofy-sweet personalities. I straightened it a bit and cropped from the left so the bag on the ground was out of frame. I also bumped up the contrast a bit., Heading to Southern Maine Community College today for Amy & Dan's wedding! Hoping the rain stays away... or at the very least, that the dramatic storm clouds provide an awesome backdrop for photos. ;), BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Jamie & Jon's camp wedding! The first shot was just a little too dull... it didn't show the true vibrancy and richness of the colors I saw in those woods. I did a tiny bit of straightening and bumped up the brightness/contrast so you could really see the fiery bed of pine needles and the lush green of the trees!, BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Emily & Andrew's wedding. For me, this shows how much of a difference that converting a photograph to black & white can make. The colors in the background were distracting me from the tender moment during their first dance. I converted it to black & white -- a high contrast b&w with dark blacks, just how I like it -- and boom., BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Deb & Lisa's Portland wedding! We ran outside for some super quick formals and this was the first shot I took, before adjusting my white balance. There are some pretty obvious cool tones. I brightened it up in Photoshop, bumped the contrast a bit, and warmed it up... voila!, BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Christina & Jon's wedding! It's generally pretty easy to get detail shots to work well SOOC (straight out of camera) since you generally have more time to adjust your settings if need be (they're not a moving target!)... so for this centerpiece shot all I ended up doing was a slight crop/straighten and bumped up the brightness/contrast to accentuate the gorgeous colors!, BEFORE & AFTER! This is a shot from Abby & Reid's Brooklyn wedding! I was happy with how spot on this was SOOC (straight out of camera)... I basically just did a slight crop, straightened it, and bumped the contrast a tiny bit!, This is damn solid advice., Heading to the North Dam Mill in Biddeford for Noelle's maternity shoot! <3, Last but not least, one of my favorite first photographs! Taken around 2002 (I was 15 years old) with an old point-and-shoot. Still love it. :), Another one of my first ever photographs, circa 2002. I think there was technically some kind of camera malfunction which added the strange lines, but I loved how much it made the photo look almost like a painting., Crazy throwback! This is one of my first ever photographs, taken when I was probably 15 years old with an old Canon point-and-shoot. I loved skies (and still do!)., Heading across town to photograph Jen & Eric's new little girl! <3 Can't wait to finally meet her!, I wanted to announce that I (FINALLY) picked a winner for my Offbeat Bride contest! They're getting married in September 2015 with a ceremony at the Santander Arena & Performing Arts Center -- a gorgeous theater built in the 1870s with red velvet seats, carved and gilded walls, and murals everywhere. After that they're heading to the Neag Planetarium (!!!) at the Reading Public Museum for their reception. They want to dance under the stars, AND there's models of space ships all around. Kind of a no-brainer. :) Congratulations Katie & Eric -- I can't wait to celebrate with you!!! <3, Easily the coolest night of my life. Yes, that's me and my mom with BILL "BIG DOG" CLINTON., Heading to a meeting this morning at Omi's Coffee Shop!

My cousins will be here for a week -- their first time exploring Portland -- and my grandparents will be here for a month!

But I am still around so if you need something, don't hesitate to contact me. :), Heading to Perkins Cove for Ashley & Josh's engagement session! <3, A bunch of us local photographers got together last week for an awesome group headshot session at the beach. We've done this several times already this year -- it's a great way for us to hang out, talk shop, and get amazing headshots while we're at it. :) Here's one of my favorites of ME, taken by Sarah Jane Photography! <3, Heading to The Portland Regency Hotel & Spa today for Jenna & Jeff's wedding! Hoping the rain holds off for their rooftop ceremony! <3, Received an AMAZING review on WeddingWire -- thank you so much, Chrissy & Chris! <3

"Justine's exceptional service started well before our wedding day with her thorough communication about important shots, the vibe of the day, and getting to know us as a couple even though we were all the way on the West Coast preparing for a Maine wedding. On the day of the wedding Justine arrived on time and ready to go. She was the perfect "fly on the wall" during the pre-wedding festivities, capturing key moments and setting stills without interrupting the flow of the day or adding any stress to the morning. She didn't miss a beat of the ceremony but also didn't interrupt our guests' view of the intimate ceremony of only 16 attendants, and post-ceremony she expedited the group photo process without sacrificing the quality of the images captured. Everyone who has seen our photos has commented on how accurately she captured the mood of the day and our personality as a couple. The candid shots of the toast, cake cutting, and dancing were especially appreciated and incredibly romantic. Finally, the turnaround on the photos was surprisingly quick, yet no editing of details was sacrificed, no corners cut- the quality of the images that we received so shortly after our wedding was remarkable. I could not have asked for better service!", Just letting everyone know that July and August are crazy busy months for me -- it is just myself and my husband (who does some back-end work, no actual shooting) running the business, so things this time of year (e-mail communication, teasers, editing, etc) move a little slower as I am busy almost every day with shoots, meetings, and phone/Skype consultations. <3, Life has been CRAZY over here and teasers have been a wee bit backed up! I currently have ELEVEN sets of teasers that are in the wings... so be patient and good things will come! <3, Heading to Castle Island early this morning for Rebecca & Quinn's family session! <3, Heading to both the Old Port (for some deliciousness at The Gelato Fiasco!) and Willard Beach for Magda & Travis's engagement session! <3, Heading to Winslow for a maternity/family session! <3, This is an amazing article.

Somewhere around 30 of us local photographers got together and just had a TON of fun -- drinking, laughing, eating lots of delicious food, hula hooping, relaxing by the fire, and of course, taking lots of photos (including a million selfies!). Sometimes it just occurs to me how lucky I am to not only be involved in such an awesome profession, but to have the most incredible group of photographers around me for support, encouragement, and advice! Here's our "official" group photo from the night (thanks to Clare Norton Photography!) -- aren't we awesome!?, Just found this amazing tiara on this fantastic bridal Etsy shop!

"I found Justine on A Practical Wedding. Even though I live in NY, I wanted Justine to come from Maine, since her pictures are so vibrant, colorful and fun... moreso than the photographers in NYC who wanted to charge me $5000 when I asked them how much they would shoot a "budget wedding" for.

She's responsive, fun, and totally a dream to work with. She knew exactly what questions to ask, and totally "got" our wedding. Her photo booth was super amazing, with great props.

Loved every second! :) If only I could have another event for Justine to shoot...", Hey y'all.

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/katie-senior-session-fort-williams-senior-session-maine-senior-photographer/, This list has been going around and while it's funny to look through, hear me out. If you're getting married, you're hiring your photographer because you love their style, their artistic vision, their editing, posing, personality, etc... not so you can give them a list of photos to copy (or STEAL, as Buzzfeed so eloquently puts it). Many of these wouldn't even be possible or practical in all (or even most) situations... many require specific lighting or time of day, access to balconies or rooftops for aerial angles, and LOTS of time dedicated to taking photographs (way more than you'll probably want to spend), plus willing participants. Not to mention the fact that some of these are obviously candid/unscripted moments. On your wedding day, hire someone you can trust to capture the day in a way you will love... and then trust them to deliver your own unique and meaningful photographs that will remind you of YOUR day, not someone's wedding you found on Pinterest. That being said... the groomsmen shot in #21 is HILARIOUS and if any couples want to recreate that, let's do it. ;)

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/renee-will-family-casco-maine-family-session-maine-family-photographer/, Got an AMAZING review on Wedding Wire - thank you so much, Erika & Mike!!! <3

"Justine was amazing. We fell in love with her photography when we came across some of her pictures on offbeatbride.com and all but decided on the spot that we wanted her as our photographer. When we saw that she was located just a couple hours away and was willing to travel, we contacted her immediately.

When we got together with her for engagement photo shoot we knew we had made the right choice. Justine was very personable and very easy to get along with. And on top of that, the pictures were amazing.

When it came to the wedding, Justine was both everywhere at once and yet completely unobtrusive. The pictures she captured were incredible but she never once got in anyone's way.

Overall, we would very highly recommend Justine Johnson photography if you're looking for a down to earth, fun, friendly, yet professional photographer who has a great eye for capturing all the important moments and then some!", This crazy map shows all of the places in New England & New York that I've been to for weddings -- WILD! :D, In case you missed it (and you DON'T want to miss it)...

" I can't even begin to express how thankful I am that I found Justine! Going into the wedding planning (from out of state!) finding a great photographer was one of my main priorities, and also the most stressful. I wanted someone that took awesome photos in a photojournalistic way, had reasonable prices, and gave me ownership of the digital files (no watermarks!). I spent several countless nights scouring the internet, and then I found Justine Johnson Photography on Offbeat Bride. I was in love! Justine met all my basic requirements and so much more!

Justine responded right away to my email, she was enthusiastic, friendly, and professional. I can't stress how awesome of a person Justine is and easy to work with. She made planning a pleasure! It also really helped that she included an engagement session in our package - it was great to get to know her before the wedding and gave her an opportunity to learn our quirks, likes and dislikes -- which all contributed to making the big day run smoothly.

On our wedding day, Justine was on time, super friendly and professional, and her assistant was great too. Justine had a clear handle on what she needed to do, so I didn't need to worry about it.

We also ordered the photobooth option -- which I have to give a shout out to Justine for having the best photobooth props! Seriously, the props were a huge hit and resulted in many funny photos of our friends doing ridiculous things.

As for the photos - they were perfect! She took the posed shots with family and the bridal party as well as so many special candid shots that captured special moments. The pictures were sharp and vibrant -- exactly what I had expected based on her online portfolio. To this day I can look at the pictures and clearly re-imagine that day.

"Justine was spectacular! I fell in love with her photos that had been featured on Offbeat Bride, and I was thrilled to find that Justine's pricing was more than reasonable. My wife and I love that her photography is vivid and full of life, and we continue to feel that the photos she took on our wedding day captured not just images, but emotions. Before the wedding, I felt like the posed shots were mostly for our parents, but even they are absolutely wonderful! I can't imagine a better wedding photographer.", HERE IT IS!!!

"Justine did the photography for our farm wedding last summer. She was one of the best choices we made in planning our event. A true professional, Justine guided us, both first time event planners, through the process. We worked with her from a distance, and she was always wiling to schedule conference calls to answer our questions. Her organization made the post-ceremony formal shots seamless. For the candids, Justine's presence was so subtle, yet she captured all our honest and beautiful moments. Most importantly, the shots are beautiful, and we are thrilled with the results. We love the pictures from our pre-wedding engagement session as well, where we met Justine for the first time just a few days before the wedding. Her energy and enthusiasm put us at ease right away. A very talented photographer, and a lovely person.", A year ago today I was down in Narragansett, Rhode Island in the middle of a snow storm photographing Erika Renae Keith & Eric's gorgeous wedding at The Towers! Happy anniversary, you two! <3, Payson & Ty's gorgeous farm wedding is featured on Rustic Wedding Chic's Top 10 Rustic Weddings from 2013!!! <3

http://rusticweddingchic.com/top-rustic-weddings-from-2013, Thinking about this as we gear up for the new year..., I got an AMAZING review on WeddingWire -- thank you SO MUCH, Sarah & Colin!!! <3

"We love Justine! I am originally from Maine and my husband is from California and currently live in Boston. We had a laid back, but classy, Maine beach wedding and we were looking for a great photographer and were lucky to get Justine. With very simple directions we were able to have just perfect photos. Justine was very easy going when arranging a plan for the day. She wanted to know all the wedding details and how we wanted our day to be. She met my husband and his family while they were getting ready and took great candid shots. She then traveled with them to the wedding site and she took great photos of the set up and all of our friends and family. When Justine takes photos, she takes one click two clicks and then done. Unlike other photographers I have met, she seems to just get the shot the first time and is great to work with. Her assistant also was very nice and you could tell was a quality person. From the moment we first chatted with Justine it seemed like we were working with a friend. We are just so happy with our wedding memories and they are all documented perfectly. She is a true artist and a professional.", MERRY CHRISTMAS, FRIENDS!!! I am spending today with family, but I wanted to say that I hope all of your days are warm, happy, and filled with awesome food... and lots of cookies. :D I'm sure Mukow will be bounding through the snow like this today..., Have a happy Christmas Eve, everyone!!!

"I actually procrastinated writing this review because I wanted to have serious time to gush over how much I love Justine and her work. I stumbled upon Justine Johnson’s photography while pouring over Offbeat Bride. The moment I looked at her pictures I knew that 1) I wanted her to be our photographer and 2) it would be awesome! Starting off with her genuine and authentic emails I then realized what a serious gem of a human I was speaking with!
Even when unexpected events at our wedding put Justine out of commission, she had amazing back up there to ensure our day was captured. Justine came with Kim and Kate who are also super awesome and deserve a shout out! Woohoo!!
We are in the middle of making plans to use our unused “Day After “shoot as a way to capture our soon to be born baby! How awesome!
Justine was amazing! If you are looking for personality both in and out of pictures, then Justine is defiantly the photographer to hire. Just look at her work! Look at the colors and how amazingly she captures the personality of the couple! As someone who identifies as “not a picture person”, I look at my wedding pictures and think, wow, I look amazing and so comfortable! Part of me being so comfy in front of the camera was because of Justine! I wished she lived closer so I could become her friend! Yes, she is that awesome! And…. She is my name twin. Thanks Justine!

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/2013-instagram/, I got one of the SWEETEST WeddingWire reviews EVER -- I am beyond words, really. Thank you so much, Elizabeth & Bruce!!! <3

" Simply put, Justine Johnson is an AMAZING photographer. We knew from the start that she was the right photographer for us -- her photos were beautiful, she was easy to talk to, and her prices were reasonable. We first met for an engagement session, which was a great way for us all to get to know one another. Several months later Justine did my boudoir shoot -- a total blast! And then the wedding -- WOW. Justine and her assistant Tina arrived right on time, then proceeded to take THE MOST BEAUTIFUL photographs we have ever seen! She was able to capture every wonderful moment from beginning to end. Within only a few days, Justine had posted "teasers" on Facebook, which was a great way to share the day with friends & family. And when we saw all of our photos 6 weeks later, our reaction was "lets get married again so Justine can take even more amazing photos!" Justine is a talented professional with a fun, easy-going personality, and we would hire her again in a heartbeat. Thank you Justine, for photographs more beautiful than we could have ever imagined -- you're the BEST!!!!!", It's holiday week!

"Justine did the photos for our wedding and we are so happy that she did. She was exactly what we were looking for in a photographer - easy-going, easy to work with, friendly, and not pushy about posed pictures or what photos should or should not be taken. She let us guide the process but offered really helpful advice and suggestions when we asked for them. The family and wedding party photos didn't feel staged at all, and, most impressively, she and her assistant, Tina, managed to get everyone organized and get all the pictures done in about 20 minutes while still making the process fun, which was awesome! Justine and Tina were awesome during the reception too - they got so many fantastic candid photos without anyone ever knowing they were having their picture taken! I also really appreciated how organized Justine was prior to the wedding in terms of asking for a list of photos we wanted taken, the names of family members and the schedule of the event (and gently reminding us to send her that info when we forgot to!). Getting that info to her ahead of time made it so much easier to do the family and wedding party photos quickly so that we could all get to the party. We have only wonderful things to say about Justine and highly highly recommend her. And the photos she sent us were beautiful!!! It was so lovely to look through the pictures and remember how much fun we had and what a great day it was, and we wouldn't be able to do that without Justine having been there :-)", Okay, I say it every time, but THIS is my favorite 2013 recap post!

"Justine was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was professional, warm, funny, and usually more enthusiastic than we were about the details of our wedding. Most importantly, her photos are amazing. We love the way she captured our wedding. We really wanted to see what the day looked like and that's exactly what we got. Justine did a wonderful job of capturing small moments and making everyone look good. We got married at a summer camp on a very rainy day, so most of our photos were either outside in the rain, or in rooms with dark wood and dim light. The outside photos are in gorgeous, vibrant color, making the camp look like a deep green fairy tale and the inside photos are glowy and warm - quite a feat for such challenging venues! I recommend Justine wholeheartedly.", Okay, I say it every time, but THIS is my favorite 2013 recap post!

I'm still just really at a loss for words for how perfectly you captured everything.  We laughed (almost) as much looking at them as we did that day.  Your use of color is a true talent and no matter how long I work with designers it never ceases to amaze me how the correct color context can enhance the mood an unsurpassable amount.

I've worked with SIX this year -- one Kate, one Kathleen, and FOUR Katies!, Heading across town for a boudoir shoot this morning! Teasers coming later.  :), The most important thing you can give your photographer? Your trust. Do your research and hire someone you truly click with and who you believe has your best interest at heart. If you do, you can relax knowing that this person has the experience and intelligence to help guide you in everything from engagement shoot locations, wedding day timeline, outfit inspiration, best (and worst) conditions to shoot in, and countless others. In all likelihood, you're pretty new to planning a wedding, prepping for head shots, arranging your family for a session, etc... but your photographer has done this MANY, many times. :), Eeee!

"I’ve thought about writing this for awhile, because I really wanted to take the time to sit down and write a proper review.  Justine was the best part of the wedding, you know, besides marrying the groom!
I am so glad we hired Justine to photograph our wedding.  Out of all the details I stressed over, the decision to hire her was never one of them.  The minute Chris and I started planning we had our photographer picked out. Before the venue, the caterer, before I had even looked at dresses! I’d seen her blog and her facebook, and all of the shoots she posts are incredible.  Her photographs are just so warm, happy, and full of life and love. That was exactly how I wanted our wedding captured.  

Justine definitely did not disappoint.  On the afternoon of our wedding she arrived at our hotel, and I felt like I was greeting an old friend even though we’d barely met!  I felt so comfortable with her taking photos of me, even though I had been a little nervous because I usually hate having my picture taken.  She just has a way about her that puts people at ease.  When it came time for group photos after the ceremony Justine and her assistant were great at rounding everyone up.  She had asked me previously for a list of all the formals I wanted done, (which was a great idea and one I never would have thought of!) and she made sure we got them all, even though my big, crazy family didn’t make it easy on her.  Throughout the night Justine was everywhere snapping photos that no one even realized she was taking! She was like our ninja-photographer popping up at just the right moments. :)

When we got back to the US after our honeymoon I was finally able to get back online and check Facebook.  I can’t even tell you how thrilled I was to see that Justine had posted our teasers, what a great feeling to see those after a looong flight!  I felt like I was reliving that night just through the few photos we got to see, and in those photos were the same qualities about her work that I had fallen in love with.  I can’t put it any other way, her photographs are just so full of life! They are absolute perfection.  

I haven’t seen all of our pictures yet, but I have nothing but the highest praise for Justine, and I have no doubt that the rest will be just as beautiful, if not more beautiful, than what we’ve seen so far.  If you’re considering hiring Justine for your wedding, for your family portraits, or anything else, GO FOR IT! I guarantee you won’t regret it.  We already have a first anniversary session booked for next year, which I am so looking forward to, and I anticipate hiring her to capture many more wonderful moments and milestones to come in our lives!", I've got at least FOUR sets of teasers coming today!!! Two engagement sessions, a wedding, and a boudoir session. :) WOO!, It's ETSY THURSDAY!!! Today on the blog is Melinda Rose Design - the most STUNNING veils, garters, headbands, and other accessories. Go check it out!

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/eli-2-years-old-fort-williams-kid-session-cape-elizabeth-maine-child-photographer/, An AMAAAAZING review I got from Laura, a boudoir AND family session client: 

"What can I say about Justine Johnson Photography?? How much time do you have?? :)
 
1. My experiences:
I was introduced to Justine's work last September by a friend who was considering a Boudoir shoot. I loved her work and the way she brought color to life in her portraits. In fact, I liked her work so much I decided to join my friend in March and have my own Boudoir shoot done! Best...decision...ever!! I was blown away (as was my husband) by her work! Everyone can recall the moment they knew they were in love...and the second my Boudoir teasers hit Facebook I knew I was head over heels for Justine Johnson Photography ;)
 
She did SUCH a great job making me look good that I couldn't be selfish and keep it all to myself- so I booked a Family Shoot with her! You know how when you go to see a movie that everyone has said is the "funniest movie ever!!", and then you see it and hardly laugh at all?? Well I was nothing short of a nervous wreck to see the outcome of the Family Shoot. I was expecting so much that I couldn't help but worry I was going to be disappointed somehow! Well she posted the Teasers and I couldn't pick my jaw up off the floor! I again...was in love!
 
2. What to expect:
If you are looking to be told how to pose or where to stand, Justine is not for you (but keep reading so I can change your mind!). She is a photojournalist- and what that means is she is not just clicking a smile, she is capturing a moment! There are no awkward hands-on-shoulders poses while looking straight at the camera. Instead she's capturing life, frozen for an instant. She waits for interactions and then clicks her time capsule. I love the portraits because she has given me the pure innocence, sweetness, and defiance of my children- and made it BEAUTIFUL! Plus, Justine herself is wonderful!! She's really nice, very comfortable to be around, and her communication via email is astounding considering she's so in-demand!
 
And COLOR!! Holy Color! I said it once before: The world lives in black and white and Justine's portraits take you to the colorful land of Oz!! Just go look at her work!
 
3. Pricing:
Insanely reasonable! And worth every penny!! I have a lovely DVD of pictures from my Boudoir Session which is a great way to keep them private. I have not ordered prints from Justine (yet) but I have seen the ones my friend ordered and the quality is top-notch!
 
4. The Addiction:
Justine is the only photographer I will ever use or recommend again! I am a Justine Johnson Photography Lifer!!", Just booked a May 2014 wedding at  Portland's Ocean Gateway - YIPEE! <3, Elizabeth & Bruce's Ogunquit, Maine engagement session -- with their Westie, Amelia, along for the ride -- is up on the blog! <3

"Justine was fantastic from the first email to the final product. Friendly, accommodating, and super helpful, she was great in working within our budget to give us an amazing documentation of our wedding day.

I was less into formal photos, and wanted more of a photo-journalist take. Justine went with what I wanted, and made helpful suggestions when there were things I was not thinking about that ended up being fun and special. In the end, I feel like we got some great traditional wedding photos and some great photojournalist photos, and I couldn't be happier.

Basically, with Justine, I felt like I got the best mix of someone who was both enjoyable to hang out with who also has a great eye for detail and art that made the final product special and something I will actually look at in the years to come, rather than putting in a photo album and forgetting about.", FRIENDS!

"Justine Johnson and her assistant Kim were everything we could have imagined in a photographer. She was kind, courteous to my family, prompt with responding to my questions, well priced, and a BLAST to work with.. Not only did she photograph our wedding but our engagement pictures as well, and I can't count how many times people asked me who did our photos and how they could get in touch with her. The professionalism, creativity and general awesomeness in Justine can't be fully expressed, so you should probably just book her to find out yourself.", FRIENDS!

Really, truly find the strongest, happiest friendship in the person you fall in love with. Someone who speaks highly of you. Someone you can laugh with. The kind of laughs that make your belly ache, and your nose snort. The embarrassing, earnest, healing kind of laughs. Wit is important. Life is too short not to love someone who lets you be a fool with them. Make sure they are somebody who lets you cry, too. Despair will come. Find someone that you want to be there with you through those times. Most importantly, marry the one that makes passion, love, and madness combine and course through you. A love that will never dilute -- even when the waters get deep, and dark." -- N'tima, Heading to Camp Cody today for Cortney & Josh's wedding!!! :D, In case you missed it...

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/laura-boudoir-maine-boudoir-photographer/, Got an AMAZING new review on WeddingWire - thank you, Esther & Brian! <3

"I hired Justine for my wedding in September. Justine was wonderful to work with. She is very laid back and lets the couple dictate how they want the pictures to go. We only had maybe 10 minutes of formals because we wanted to focus on our party and have more candid shots. Instead of having pre formed packages she works with people to build a package that suits their needs and budget.
Her work is beautiful! She does an excellent job of capturing not just the details but the feeling of the moment. You will want to print every shot and hang it on your wall, she has a great eye for composition! She blends into the scene while capturing the moments perfectly. She is like a really adorable photo snapping ninja!", In case you missed it... Liz & Joe's Fort Williams Park engagement session is up on the blog! :D

Obviously I LOVE THIS and have probably found a friend for life, but I also want to clarify... the Christmas sweaters are Photoshopped, but I AM indeed standing with Patrick Stewart. :D Here's the original photo:, Check out Rialto Restaurant's website to see a small gallery of my photos from Lauren & Jason's wedding!!! <3

"First, I have to say I truly couldn't be happier with our wedding photos. They are so beautiful! When I saw Justine's work online, I was immediately struck by the casual and colorful style of her photos. Other reviewers have mentioned how unobtrusive Justine is while she's working, and it's so true. I'm not someone who loves posing for photos, but she made it easy. She was able to photograph so many candid moments that really helped capture the spirit of our wedding. Justine was friendly and professional, quick to respond to emails, and had great prices. She also told me she thought my wedding was fun and put up some photos on Facebook the next day, which was awesome. Go book her now, you won't regret it!", In case you missed it... Meg & Carrie's "Day After" session is up on the blog!!! These two are amazing... running around the East and West ends in the snow, being goofy, letting out their inner child on the playground.

One of my photographs has officially been on a CAKE!!! This is a shot from Chelsie & Nick's amazingly colorful engagement session - Chelsie's co-workers had it put on a cake for a surprise bridal shower! AMAAAAZING!, Just to clarify, in case anyone is confused... the "before & after" shots that I'm posting are what I have ALREADY done to the photo to edit it - not new things that I'm doing! The purpose is to show how sometimes editing is just used to enhance what's already there, but sometimes it can be more dramatic and really change the photo - and I know it can be cool for some of you to see what some of my SOOC (straight out of camera) shots look like. :), Meg & Carrie's wintery "Day After" session is up on the blog today!!!

Barely even touched the original... just bumped the contrast ever so slightly!, For Deja... a before & after from HER wedding!

I brightened it up, added some more contrast, and warmed up the overall color, as well as straightening it!, For Liz... here's a before & after from Katie's senior session! I try to keep seniors as natural as possible, so I brightened a bit, upped the contrast, and intensified the coloring behind her!, For Birdie... here's a before & after from Jeremy & Jenna's wedding! This is a good example of how the natural setting sometimes makes my job super easy... hardly any editing needed here, I just bumped the contrast a bit. :), For Lisa... here's a before & after from Callum's 9-month session! Just brightened it up a bit and cropped in slightly. :), Here's my first before & after shot! This is from Darcy & Brian's anniversary session, taken right when the sun was setting! All I did was up the contrast a bit, make the greens more vivid, cropped a bit from the right, and voila!, I'd love to show off some before & afters on here so y'all can see the difference between a SOOC (aka "straight out of camera") shot and an edited shot.

"Justine was wonderful! She offered us an engagement shoot as part of our wedding package so that we could get comfortable in front of her and in front of the camera. Unfortunately, we were unable to schedule a time before the wedding due to weather, but it ended up not mattering! Justine made us feel so comfortable and our photos don't look staged or forced in anyway. She did such a great job of capturing the spirit of who we are. The photos are colorful and bright and you can really feel the joy that was in the air that day. I'll be doing a boudoir shoot with Justine next month and I can't wait.", Heading to the East End, Portland, Maine for Chelsea's family session!!! <3, Jenn's maternity boudoir session is up on the blog today!!! :D

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/instagram-monday-080413-081113/, My wedding portfolio is huge and I like it that way. Why? Well, partially, I can't bring myself to narrow it down - I love them all! But primarily it's because I love showing the wide array of photos. There's couples of all different ages, sizes, ethnicities & races, and sexual orientations. There's dramatic black & white shots alongside bright and happy color shots. There's couples on the beach, on a mountain, in a church, in a graffiti-covered alleyway, at the playground, in a field, in the woods, at a country club, on a farm, in a garden, and at a castle... to name a few. ;) Some are formal, some are casual, and all of them are different and unique, but all of them are having FUN and it shows. :D, In case you missed it... Erika & Mike's wintery Fort Williams Park engagement session is on the blog! :D

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/instagram-monday-080413-081113/, This is actually a really brilliant photographer's perspective on Pinterest - primarily, why sending your photographer a Pinterest board of photos you'd like to re-create actually HINDERS the creative process rather than encouraging it.

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/erika-eric-engaged-fort-williams-engagement-session-cape-elizabeth-maine-engagement-photographer/, Brilliant. My favorite bit? 

"You're looking at other people's organic moments which arose from their life as it happened and held personal meaning for them. So much meaning you also were moved and pinned their photo into your inspired wedding shot list.

Permit your own amazing moments to happen by not using your precious time to copy someone else's life.

And invariably, down the road, another bride will covet the photos of your moments as her inspiration for her wedding shot list.", In case you missed it... Jasmine & Bryan's Southern Maine Community College engagement session is on the blog! :D

www.justinejohnsonblog.com/molly-senior-fort-williams-senior-session-maine-senior-photographer/, Just got an awesome review on WeddingWire! Thank you, Danielle & Jason! <3

"Justine Johnson is very good at two things: taking awesome pictures, and getting back to your emails with lightening speed. She did an engagement shoot and our wedding, and our pictures came out FANTASTIC. She really knows how to use editing software well and to make your pictures look visually stunning. She has a great eye and an obvious passion for what she does. The things that I wasn't as impressed with was the lack of clear direction. I'm not a person who is naturally comfortable in front of the camera, so I would have preferred it if Justine and/or her assistant Kim had a more "in-charge" personality for family shots (like: "Uncle Jim, you stand here. Put your hand like this. Grandma, you stand here.," etc.) , rather than "what are we doing next?" That said, I'm sure it's not easy to wrangle 20 family members, none of whom you know! All in all, I would recommend Justine if you want someone who is funny, easygoing but professional, and can communicate online very well.", Okay, I know you're all eagerly anticipating this announcement. I have officially chosen a winner for my DOMA contest. Well, actually, I've chosen TWO because I cannot possibly narrow it down any further! So the lucky winners are... Sarah & Allie (having a giant vow renewal celebration in Seattle) AND Alisa & Kim (saying their vows under blossoming apple trees in a New England orchard). YIPEEEE!!!!! <3, Oh, you know, just the amazing view of Katahdin from the New England Outdoor Center, where Liz & Joe's wedding took place. This was AFTER the crazy storm, when the sky opened up to show off the most amazing sunset!, Molly's Fort Williams Park senior session is up on the blog today!!! <3

Landed safely in Portland this evening - miss my family SO MUCH already, but we missed Portland like crazy, too. We're relaxing tonight with our favorite dinner (spaghetti & garlic bread) and our favorite TV show (Star Trek), but I'll be back in action temporarily tomorrow before I head off to New York City for a wild wedding weekend!!! E-mails will be answered tomorrow, so hold onto your hats.  :), I am SO EXCITED to finally announce this (I've known for several weeks but somehow kept quiet): Tracy & Mike's Plumbing Museum wedding is featured on Rock 'n Roll Bride today!!!!! AHHHH!!!

We were greeted by several of my family members at the airport, had some spicy & messy wings for lunch, and LaRosa's pizza for dinner! And it's in the 70's/80's here. Awesome vacation so far. :), Heading to Camp Wing in Duxbury, MA with Tina today for Jamie & Jon's wedding! This rain ain't gonna hold us down!!!, Forecast for today's wedding? Low 50's, 70% chance of rain, 15mph winds. Forecast for tomorrow's wedding? Low 50's, 50% chance of rain, 18mph winds. Am I upset? Nope. There's going to be just as much beauty, love, and FUN even with the crazy weather.

"They say getting a tattoo is addictive but it's actually getting your picture taken by Justine Johnson Photography that is REALLY addictive!! Justine is just...plain...awesome!! I have been an admirer of Justine's work since I liked her FB page. The COLOR she is able to get is unreal! It's like the rest of the world is plain black and white Kansas and Justine's shots take us to colorful OZ!

She's got great customer service skills and responds quickly with any questions you have! She's honest, approachable, affordable, and super cool!

I finally met Justine in March when I did a boudoir shoot. Talk about feeling like a woman! If you have ever thought about getting a boudoir shoot done- DO IT (by Justine of course!)!! She's so cool I never felt uncomfortable at all! And she's nice!! She lets you be you without attempting to awkwardly pose you but she has no problem giving you advice if you ask for it!

I enjoyed that experience so much that I actually booked a family shoot with her for this fall- even before I saw the boudoir pictures!! Yup- that's how great I think she is! Well my boudoir pictures went up on her gallery last night and WOW! So in love! You will be too- you have to let her take your picture just once and you'll be as addicted to her as I am! Just "like" her FB page for crying out loud- you'll see her amazing work for yourself!
I even joked that I hope she's still in business when my 1yr old needs her Senior pictures done!!

My sister saw my pictures last night and now she wants to get hers done and I totally plan on doing them again too!!

This was because people generally took their yearly bath in May, so they still smelled pretty good by the time June rolled around. As you can imagine, however, they were starting to smell, so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor.

"Choosing a wedding photographer was one of the most important selections of my wedding. Justine was the perfect answer to exactly what I was looking for in a photographer. She was super responsive to all of my (many...oh so many) questions and her quick answers were truly appreciated as I tried to plan the wedding. All of her emails put me in a good mood as they always started and ended with such joy and excitement...and a smiley face :)

She doesn't know this, but I showed her website to my friend (who is a professional photographer) and immediately told me that I should pick her as our wedding photographer. My friend said she captures such excellent angles and emotions, that is exactly what I will want to see in pictures, especially the candid shots.

I can't tell you how correct my friend was with his advice! Justine was so amazing on our wedding day. She caught some excellent moments that have quickly become my favorite pictures of our wedding day. I even get compliments from my family and guests on how great the photos look. To this day (nearly 6 months later!) I still here our guests praising how lovely the photographer was and asking, "how on earth did you find such a gem"?

Justine was truly the best pick! She is extremely professional and captures excellent moments of the most important day of your life.", Katie & Joel's Portland, Maine wedding is up on the blog today! <3

Two things: 1) Weekends are BY FAR the busiest time of week for me, so from now until, basically, the end of November, weekend availability is EXTREMELY limited. 2) If you're wanting to book a shoot or wedding with me, keep in mind that the sooner you book, the better!

"Justine produces truly amazing work. She seemed as excited about our wedding as I was - I liked her from the first "Yay!!" in her emails! She was personable yet professional, and melted into the background on the day itself. Though we have a complex and extra-large set of relatives and divorced parents, Justine managed to power through more than 30 family portraits in less than half an hour!

Her use of color is unparalleled - it's the first thing everyone notices when they see our photos. It makes you smile just to look at them. In fact, I've stayed subscribed to her Facebook page long after the wedding, just because I like looking at her work - even when the people in the pics are strangers! The quality of her photography far outpaces her reasonable rates, and we feel very lucky to have had her.

Justine has taken some of my all-time favorite photos of my husband and me, and I look forward to hiring her for family shoots in the future. She is someone who loves her work, and it shows.", Working on some changes to my website! :D, Heading to Silly's Restaurant shortly to get lunch with a fellow photographer!

The shoots are all awesome, and should all be insanely fun, so some of you could help me realize some of my dreams for 2013.  :), OK, ladies - everyone who contacted me about the free boudoir shoots has now received a response from me, whether you were chosen or not! <3, Who's feeling adventurous enough to do an outdoor boudoir session at Cascade Falls in Saco?

You must book the shoot by Valentine's Day, and the shoot must take place by August 31st! Contact me for pricing & other info. :), Hi, 2014 seniors!!!

Summer and fall book up VERY quickly, so contact me ASAP if you want to book your senior session.  :), I am SO behind on blogging. (How behind are you?) I'm so behind that the next wedding I post will be from... August 2011. Yep., Awesome vendors, awesome guests, an awesome assistant, a photo booth, boozy drinks, lots of dancing, cupcakes & macarons & cookies galore, espresso ice cream, a live band, a bad ass DJ, trapeze artists, belly dancers, a taco truck parked outside, and a burlesque performance... yeah, I'd say it was a pretty successful day. Fuck yeah, The Lovesick Expo!!!, LOVESICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Last day of preparing before... The Lovesick Expo!!! I am beyond excited but this is going to be a chaotic day to say the least. :), Hey, friends! Super crazy deal time... for a limited time (duh).

Pick-up only, located in Portland!, Just got an AWESOME review on WeddingWire... thank you so much, Jillian & Clay!!! <3

"Justine is wonderful, plain and simple. My husband and I wanted a small wedding (10 people!) but still wanted to have professional photography services. I found Justine by searching the Internet for hours and sending many inquiries to various photographers. Thank goodness Justine responded and I didn't book someone else. Our email correspondence was so friendly and personal...I love how she asked questions about us as a couple. It seemed like she knew us before we ever met. I hired Justine for two hours only, since our wedding ceremony and reception was so intimate I figured that was plenty of time. She sent us back a TON of amazing photos. She sent us the teasers as we were sitting on the plane about to leave for our honeymoon!! I almost cried. Sooo good.

The wedding day goes by in the blink of an eye, my only regret is that I didn't get a chance to chat with Justine more and get to know her. She is so sweet and easy to talk to. Anyone who hires Justine will probably feel the same way. I wish her all the success in the world!!", Ladies! Just so you know, if you're ever interested in booking a boudoir shoot with me and you need the photos (or an album) by a certain date (birthday, anniversary, wedding, Valentine's, etc), be sure to get in touch with me EARLY! It takes around 2-3 weeks for me to edit the photos, and another 2-3 weeks for me to design & print an album for you! It breaks my heart when people get in touch with me only a week or two from their deadline and I can't help!, Just in case you needed more reasons to attend The Lovesick Expo on Sunday... here's a quick video from the NYC/Philly expos that happened last weekend!

We're looking for one. :), Just got an awesome review on WeddingWire... thank you so much, Laurin & Phil! <3

"Justine was a wonderful photographer and a perfect choice for us and our wedding. She was flexible, friendly and very nice to work with. We were planning our wedding from abroad, and Justine always kept in contact with us via email and Skype as well as meeting us before our big day. During the wedding Justine captured every moment possible, from the pre-wedding preparations, to the church service and the reception. We were so pleased with the quality of the photos and the quick turn around to get view our pictures! Every photo embodied who were are as people and the style of our wedding. I would highly recommend Justine for future weddings and love looking at all she does on Facebook. Thank you again for capturing our special day!", Oh yes.

"We hired Justine for our Sept 29 wedding in Lincoln this past fall. We first met her for our engagement pictures the fall before. First off, SO happy we did engagement pictures, not only because they were amazing but also because it was so nice to get to know your photographer before the actual wedding. By the day of the wedding I felt like a friend of ours was doing our photography. It was so wonderful feeling totally comfortable around her (letting someone take totally sappy pictures of you can be akward at first!) and really trusting all of her judgement. All of our engagement pictures were gorgeous and our wedding pictures were even better!! She has a way of capturing these really candid genuine moments. Some of our favorite pictures were ones we weren't even posing for.

One of my concerns was having a photographer or videographer up front and center during a super intimate moment during our ceremony. I've been to too many wedding where the photographers were totally blocking the bride and groom or almost looked to be part of the ceremony. We didn't even see Justine during our ceremony!! Almost to the point where I was nervous weather she had captured good cermoney pictures....low and behold, she someohow did it!! She has a way of being right there without you even knowing!!

We had an absolutely wonderful wedding, I was SO happy with everyone single vendor we chose so it means a lot when I say hiring her was the best decision we made!! Also, by far the best value. So many of the photographers we looked into were so incredibly expensive, so we were really lucky to find her!! I've already warned Justine that as soon as we start a family she'll be one of the first people we call for "bump" pictures or family session!", My Etsy shop is officially open for business! <3

Thank you both so much!!!

"Justine's love of color & her stunning seaside photography attracted us to her work. She is a consummate professional, flexible about methods of communication & quick with detailed/friendly replies. Conversations were extremely helpful insofar as her questions prompted us to think in new ways about our ceremony. We are grateful that she took the time to understand everything usual/unusual about our weekend. Working with Justine helped us to make our event more memorable - her love of quirkiness & her knowledge of craft helped us be MORE us on our big day.

During the weekend itself, she & her assistant proved a perfect mix of friendly yet unobtrusive - our guests all noted how much they enjoyed meeting Justine, yet we hardly noticed as she got into the perfect spot at the right time to catch personal moments without making us feel self-conscious. Justine was able to capture the spirit of the weekend & managed some intimate, emotional shots we'll be forever grateful to have. Her patience as we collected our kitties for a 'family portrait' & her uncanny ability to sense a spontaneous moment are especially great qualities in a wedding photographer.

The qualities we loved in her portfolio came through in abundant glory in the shots Justine took for us - candids capture the many personalities & moods of our weekend, compositions are multifaceted artworks that shine like jewels on our walls, & the story told through her images offers a unique record that lets us experience the handfasting anew. Justine's ability to capture both minute detail & social panorama make her the consummate wedding photographer.

We cannot recommend Justine highly enough. She is an absolute professional, yet extremely personable. Her approach to her work & her packages/pricing are flexible, yet consistently top-notch. We are not merely thrilled with Justine's work - we are PROUD to be part of the Justine Johnson Photography family.", Got this amazing review today... thank you, Laura & Daniel!! <3

"Justine was fantastic to work with ... she asked a lot of clarifying questions to be sure she understood what we wanted even when I wasn't sure myself what it was we wanted. She was very friendly, approachable, flexible, kind and laid back and was able to capture the heartfelt and happy moments in the relatively short time she was at our commitment ceremony and celebration and got some beautiful photographs. She obviously is good at what she does, has very high standards and her photographs show it.", Got this awesome review on WeddingWire the other day... thank you so much, Becky & Jim! <3

"Having been in the customer-service field for quite some time, I know excellent service when I get it. Justine was an absolutely great photographer. She was timely to responding to emails and just from her text can you sense her excitement and enthusiasm; that is something I absolutely love. Justine was also flexible enough to extended the discount for the coupon I had found last minute. Justine and Kim were so cool in person and were supremely friendly and accommodating. As far as the actual photos, Justine really knows how to highlight the uniqueness in your wedding and knows how to capture moments from an interesting perspective. If you want unique, fun, meaningful photos for any occasion and great service, contact her NOW!", Hey, brides-to-be! It's not too late to buy tickets for the Lovesick Expo in Boston!

WIN., Heading downtown shortly for a sisters shoot! <3, Just received an AMAZING review on WeddingWire! Thank you, Abby & Jon, for rocking so hard!!!

"Justine was so easy going and so so flexible. She also provided something no one else had which really tipped the scales for us. In the early part of our correspondence she matched my level of enthusiasm and excitement throughout a lengthy series of email exchanges while still remaining professional. I felt like she we had connected on a personal level right away. This is something i'm pretty sure every bride wants but it kind of hard to find. You're super excited about that beginning stage of wedding planning but not all the vendors you contact will respect that. We were met with alot of neutrality and auto responses before we found Justine.

The wedding was about 6 months ago and our friends and family are still raving about our pictures. One engaged friend even asked if he could borrow our photos to show his photographer (whom he is already contracted with:(.

Justine's natural realistic style and philosophy is what sets her apart. I've never heard of a photographer who was so easy going. 'You don't like formal pictures? OK, no problem! Forgot to send me a list of important guests? Don't worry about it! You'd prefer not to stage photos of the bridal party as if we all happened to be walking in a line laughing together? me either!'

She was a pleasure to work with from the very first step, she made me feel 100% at ease, and our pictures came out better than I could have imagined!", It's only January 4th and I am already SO EXCITED for 2013. I've got some ROCKING weddings to photograph, some amazing portrait clients on the books, my very first wedding expo, and lots of family time carved out already.

"Justine was the first of many great wedding decisions. I had liked her page on facebook well before getting engaged and fell in love with her work. I contacted her as soon as we had set a date, crossing my fingers that she would be available, affordable, and willing to travel to RI. Lucky for us, she was!

We had exchanged emails for a while and I got a great sense of her personality, further confirming that we chose the right photographer. We also met via Skype soon before our wedding, which was awesome to be able to do so we could "meet" her before the big day.

At our wedding, Justine and her assistant FLEW through the formals (thank goodness!), so we had plenty of time to get nice couple shots before going into the reception to have fun with our guests. We were giggly and excited, but they were having fun and laughing too, which just added to the high energy of the day - and made for beautiful photos. Comments about Justine's "photo ninja" skills are absolutely true. I don't remember seeing her, yet her photos prove she was right in the middle of all the action. We hired her for candid shots and we got so many great ones. We loved looking through our photos to relive some moments and to look at some of the moments that we missed.

And here's a list of some other perks of hiring Justine: She posted teasers the day after that really WERE a tease! We were blown away and so looking forward to seeing more. She sent us our photos through both Dropbox and DVD. Any additional edits we requested (not for photographic error, but for removing non-family members for family books and photo cards) were taken care of immediately and the results looked flawless.

Justine is a professional memory maker and her passion for her work is what makes her art so beautiful. We look forward to having a photo shoot with her in the spring and we hope to have many more joyous occasions to photograph because we want to hire her again and again! ", Any of you Ohio peeps...

http://cheezburger.com/6783997952, On the docket today? Lots and lots and lots of hot tea with honey. Like, gallons of it. I would just have it pumped directly into my veins but that would rob it of its magical throat-healing properties., One of my all-time favorite expressions (that is vastly underused)? "On the fritz". For example: "Her house is freezing because her heater is on the fritz." What is your favorite expression? Share it with me before 5:00pm today - after that I'll pick my favorite one, and the submitter will get a $10 iTunes gift card in the mail from me.  :), Maybe got a little overzealous yesterday, since my cold symptoms are back with a vengeance today. Awesome! (Not.), Taking a good chunk of today off to work on our house! Finally putting the final coat of paint on my office (wait till you see the color!) & getting myself all settled in here, unpacking a ton of books & other things, and just generally making it feel like a HOME in here instead of a bunch of half-finished rooms.  :), I would like to nominate this for Best Wedding Photo In the History of Time PLEASE AND THANK YOU. I would also like to thank the Wedding Gods for sending me awesome couples like this.

http://whatshouldwecallweddingphoto.tumblr.com/, As of today I only have ONE wedding left in 2012, and it's not till December 29th! Feels weird., Heading down to Stratford, Connecticut, early today for Brooke & Jon's Super Mario themed wedding!!! <3, On a related note, after today I will have photographed TEN same sex ceremonies. I am looking forward to photographing many more in the future, especially now that same sex marriage is FINALLY legal in our beautiful state of Maine!!! <3, Heading to the Mariner's Church today for Kerri & Amy's wedding!!! <3, I love getting replies like this when I send couples their wedding gallery. :)

"Holy crap are you kidding me?!??! AH-MAZING! I seriously don't even know where to begin with albums, these pictures are FANTASTIC!!! Words can't describe how lucky I feel that you were our photographer. :)", If you want to see some of the cute/awesome things I find on Etsy, go check out my new blog! Just in time for Christmas shopping.  ;)
http://www.tumblr.com/blog/etsygems, Somehow I knew, months ago, that it would be bad to order 50 sheets of return address stickers for my business... and now that we're fully moved into our house, I have confirmed that it was, indeed. Oops!, This is awesome. More scientific than photographic, perhaps, but he did an awesome job of photographing them, so it qualifies!

http://anthologymag.com/blog3/2012/09/24/berndnaut-smilde/, The Boston Circus Guild will be at the Lovesick Expo, an offbeat bridal expo that I'm going to be at in January! If any of you are getting married in 2013 and beyond and still looking for wedding vendors, especially off the offbeat and quirky variety, I highly recommend you come check the Lovesick Expo out - and come say hi to me and Kim while you're at it! <3, Absolutely beaming with joy and pride. I had a good feeling about Yes on 1 this year, and I am so glad that our beautiful state decided to say YES, EVERYONE should be free to marry who they love. I have many gay friends who have been patiently -- and not so patiently -- waiting to be able to marry the love of their life in their home state, and I am so happy that they will be able to do that now, proudly and enthusiastically. YES ON 1! GO MAINE!, YES ON 1! YES ON 1! YES ON 1! So damn proud of my state., Pretty sure this voting discount is the LAST discount I'll ever offer, so grab it while it's hot. :D, Hey, friends! Voting is INSANELY IMPORTANT. So important, in fact, that if you e-mail me a photo of you with your "I Voted!" sticker (or any kind of proof that you voted today, or any day, leading up to this 2012 election), you'll receive 30% off any photo session of your choice (excluding weddings). I don't care WHO or WHAT you're voting for - I just care that you're getting out there and exercising your right to vote!!!, Greatest moment of my whole life. Yes, that's me and my husband with SIR PATRICK STEWART., I just wanted you all to know how important it is to vote YES ON 1 if you're a Maine resident. I try not to get too political on here, but honestly, I don't think this should be a political issue. I have photographed so many beautiful same-sex couples and it pains me to think that if you're a same-sex couple in Maine, your ability to marry the person you love is hindered by people who would actively vote against your happiness and your rights as a citizen of the United States, and your rights as a human being. EVERYONE in this country deserves the same rights, which is why I will be enthusiastically voting YES ON 1 tomorrow, and I hope you will, too., Heading down to Cambridge, MA EARLY this morning for Lauren & Jason's wedding! <3, Heading into Lewiston for a family shoot with a fantastic couple and their three grandkids! <3, Heading to Smiling Hill Farm to do family photos for my assistant, Kim, and her awesome family! <3, Also just booked a May 2013 wedding at a summer camp in Duxbury, MA! :D, Just booked a September 2013 wedding at Moody Mountain Farm in Wolfeboro, NH! Can't wait to go back there! <3, Hey, friends! I've got a Halloween special going on TODAY ONLY!!! It's such a good deal, it's scary... get it?!?! If you contact me TODAY and book a shoot for either November or December, you'll get 20% off. I know... pretty crazy. This could be an engagement session, a boudoir session (no need to worry about how cold it might be outside!), a family session, head shots, new baby, maternity, whatever you like!, Officially HOME!!! A little bit of settling in today and then back to normal! If you've e-mailed or messaged me in the past week, I'll be responding TODAY! :), How are y'all East Coasters? Everything okay??, Thanks to this bitch of a hurricane, we're stuck in Austin for an extra day (at least). But look at this weather! Can I really complain? :), Heading all over Austin for Rachel & Casey's engagement shoot soon!!! <3, If anyone has any ideas of places we MUST see (or places we must EAT!) while we're in Austin, let me know!!! :D, Hello, friends! My husband and I are leaving TOMORROW for our awesome week in Austin, Texas... so if there's anything you need from me, e-mail or message me on here TODAY! I'm tying up all loose ends that I possibly can before we head out, so if you have any questions/requests/etc that can't wait, get at me!!! <3, Heading to Dover, New Hampshire today for Ross & Shannon's wedding! <3, This is probably the craziest month of my life thus far, so thank you all SO MUCH for bearing with me and being patient throughout all of this!!!

We're trying to get this house looking like a bit more than just a bunch of rooms filled with boxes. ;), We're all moved in! Please bear with me as things are pretty chaotic while we live with my Mom (and out of boxes) for the next few days... but my computer is all set up (yipee!) so editing and e-mailing shall resume as normal.  :) YAY!!!, Heading down to Gloucester, MA, today with David Zwickerhill for Rebecca & Quinn's wedding at Hammond Castle!!!

http://www.hammondcastle.org, Kristen & Mat's Memorial Park wedding is up on the blog! <3

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/kristen-mat-married-08-06-11-memorial-park-wedding-maine-wedding-photographer/, Woke up to an AMAZING review today - thank you, Tiff & Dave!!! <3

"OK, I don't even know where to start with Justine. Everything about our experience with her was just perfect. I will start off by saying i met with a couple of other photographers before but they were not what I was looking for. I found her on Craigslist out of all places. I am from Rhode Island and it just so happened that she was headed down this way a couple days after talking to her so we met before her other shoot. Not even 5 minutes into our meeting I knew she was the one to shoot our wedding. She is so down to earth, easy to talk to about our wedding (and she was legitimately excited to hear about our ideas) and her portfolio speaks for itself with how talented she is. Also, her prices? Ridiculously reasonable- she doesn't believe in charging a lot, but absolutely could if she wanted to. My husband and I drove up to Portland to do our engagement pictures and they turned out absolutely gorgeous. It was more like hanging out with a friend rather than having pictures taken! The ceremony and reception were awesome. I couldn't even tell Justine was there! The sneak peaks came out within 3 days, and they are absolutely amazing!! I cannot wait to see more. I could really go on and on about Justine, she is awesome! Definitely consider her when looking for a photographer.", Heading downtown for Caroline & Silas's rainy day engagement session! <3, Truth!, Okay, so, it's official: we're buying a house! Closing date is Monday the 15th. :D WOOT., 7 out of the 11 things on my To Do list are done, so... pretty good morning so far!, Heading to Londonderry, NH today for Becky & Jim's Tupelo Music Hall wedding!!! <3

http://www.tupelohall.com/, Such an awesome e-mail from one of my September brides.  :')

"Finally a computer!  I’ve been able to obsess over our teasers via my phone but finally I can write back to you!  When friends first started sharing pictures after the wedding I thought ‘wow these are great’ but then you posted your teasers and it blew every single one of those away!  Truly, choosing you to be our photographer has been the single best decision made planning this wedding!  (which says SO much because I loved the band and the food was phenomenal!) You have a way of making our cold, drizzly day look like a beautiful fall day full of foliage and lots of LOVE!  Even our engagement shoot was an absolutely freezing day (the day before the huge snowstorm in Oct) but you would never guess from the pictures!  Thank you for these beautiful teaser, I’m so excited for what’s to come!!  Besides the photos I appreciate how organized you were and so lax, we were SO comfortable around you!", Heading to Laura & Daniel's wedding at Little Duck Pond in Windham! <3, "Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing."

"Justine is an absolutely amazing photographer and we would highly recommend her to anyone that needs photography services!! Organized, kind, professional, and totally awesome she made our wedding day fun and easy. She made the formal photos session run smoothly and quickly and faded into the background during the reception. I cant wait to see the photos that she has taken!!! She puts all edited photos on a custom DVD and sends it to you with the rights to the photos...so awesome, we are so excited to get it!! And, just a day later there were "teasers" posted on facebook that are absolutely AMAZING! They look like they could be featured on a billboard or in a magazine. And most importantly, she made us feel beautiful :) Thank you so much for everything! You have a true talent and we are so happy that you were apart of our wedding day. All in all, we HIGHLY recommend Justine...her photos ROCK! :p", I totally can't believe it's October already. WHOA. On that note... October is about 98% BOOKED at the moment.

Busy day! <3, Just so everyone knows, I'm still getting my ass kicked by this cold, so if I seem a bit spacey the past few days, it's because I am.  ;), Heading to Portsmouth for Lucy & Chris's engagement session! <3, Being self-employed means I don't often go for interviews, but I have one this morning, and I'm kiiiiinda nervous., I may have been a little overzealous with my prediction of teasers today... I have a cold brewing (thank you, lovely, contagious husband!) that is already kicking my ass. But teasers will be up TOMORROW, so just use this extra time to get even MORE excited.  ;), The soundtrack to my current editing fest is the sound of my husband watching the movie Ronin on the other side of the room. Because nothing is as inspiring as the sound of gun shots and Robert De Niro yelling. ;), Just a quick shot of one of the awesome llamas from yesterday - my new best friends!!!, Just got an awesome new review - thank you SO MUCH to Alex & Roger! I LOVED you guys, and as you can tell by my profile picture, I LOVED your wedding as well.  :)

"I hired Justine based on photos I saw of hers on the internet. Somehow, I just had a feeling...when she and I had a couple of emails back and forth, my feeling was confirmed! Justine was very enthusiastic about our wedding, and that meant as much to me as the photos. When we met with her before the wedding, she took notes, and she emailed us before the event to go over things. She was organized, professional, and FUN! During the wedding, you couldn't even see her, and yet, when you needed to ask her something, suddenly she was right by your side. She's a stealthy photographer, and that's how it should be. When we got the photos--WOW! She has quite an eye, and loves color, but she'll make a black and white photo that is spot on. She captured our day perfectly. I would recommend her for any photography assignment. She's wonderful--5 stars!", Just to get you pumped up for teasers today... I have teasers from a fantastic senior session, a Fort Williams family session, a bookstore wedding (with a rainbow cake!), AND... a wedding where I got to pet a llama (and the llama got to sniff the bride's bouquet).

http://www.justinejohnsonblog.com/, It's hard to believe that 3 years ago today (almost to the minute), my husband and I were on Long Island, Maine, saying our vows to one another. It's sunnier today than it was that day, but it was still absolutely perfect, and listening to our wedding song (I walked down the aisle to "Reckoner" by Radiohead) still makes me cry (happy tears!). Nate Johnson, you're my one in five billion! <3, We just booked our 2013 vacation with my husband's family! The down side is that I am no longer available one weekend in September 2013.

So excited -- such a gorgeous town, and brings back lots of childhood memories!, Just a random question: when you follow a photographer on Facebook, what are your favorite kinds of posts? Do you like reading about their day-to-day (updates on editing, meetings, wedding bookings)? Do you like reading their more personal posts (talking about their partner, their pets, their adventures in their personal life)? Do you like seeing photo updates (teasers, full weddings, other shoots)? Do you like seeing tips and recommendations (ideas for weddings, clothing suggestions, decor inspiration)? Other? Let me know!!!, Heading to Scarborough Grounds this morning to meet with a potential couple and talk about their June 2013 wedding at Broadturn Farm in Scarborough!

http://justinejohnsonphotography.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/julie-portrait-session-maine-lifestyle-photographer/, Alright, beauty shoot ladies... all of your head shots have been sent off to Natasha, who will have the final say in choosing everyone!!! Once the ladies are all chosen, it will be time to schedule a day and make this happen. :D, I'm about to get brutally honest for a second here. Shot lists like the one I just linked to (from The Knot, naturally) are NOT your friend. When you're looking for a photographer, make sure you find someone and connect with them on a level that allows you to TRUST them to get fantastic photos of your day. When you look back at your wedding photos, do you want to remember how the photographer posed you in front of the mirror, pretending to check yourself out? Or do you want to remember moments of pure and spontaneous joy that could never be staged or posed in a million years? Do you want your photographer to deliver every shot that The Knot says you "need" and wind up with photos that are carbon copies of a million other brides'? Or do you want your photographs to be unique to you and only you? Think about it.

http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-planning/wedding-photography-videography/articles/85-great-wedding-photo-suggestions.aspx?MsdVisit=1, I got another amazing Wedding Wire review... thank you so much, Kayla & Joe!!! 

"Justine was absolutely amazing! She showed up and for the rest of the day I barely knew she was there, but our photos came out so perfect. My husband and I are so glad we chose her for our photographer, and could not have asked for more. She is more than reasonably prices, does an amazing job and is so sweet! She genuinely cares about getting to know you, the people involved with your wedding and what you want out of her as a photographer. I can't recommend her enough to people looking for wedding/photography. She is extremely talented, artistic and I would hire here again in a heartbeat.", Heidi & Mike's family session with their 3 awesome boys is up on the blog! Lots of seaweed and sand. :)

"Justine was a dream! She has been nothing but accommodating to our needs. She posted some teaser photos to facebook already and just those 15 pics have gotten some pretty amazing comments from our friends. Now I have to wait the 4 weeks of editing to get the rest. I can't wait to see what she got! Also she was amazing at our wedding. I didn't even notice her being there, but when I did it was more like she was a guest than a vendor. Love her so much! would hire her again in a heart beat. We have our Trash the dress shoot in a couple of weeks, it will be nice to see her again. Thanks for being awesome Justine!", Alright, ladies - still accepting headshots for the beauty shoot!

Good start to the day!, Most awesome e-mail ever? Quite possibly.

"Um...WOW!  Justine...there are no words with which to communicate how much I love those STUNNING pictures!  Sorry I didn't respond right away...I'm in England teaching at the moment, so sometimes a few days go by before I get to check my email! The collection is absolutely beautiful...I just finished looking through it for the first time & I'm blown away by how well you captured not just everything I remember, but all the great moments I missed! I will be sure to write the glowingest of reviews on Wedding Wire (or anywhere else it might help you!) as soon as I get a minute out of class!

Can't I edit while I'm in there or something?, “The first step — especially for young people with energy and drive and talent, but not money — the first step to controlling your world is to control your culture. To model and demonstrate the kind of world you demand to live in. To write the books. Make the music. Shoot the films. Paint the art.”
