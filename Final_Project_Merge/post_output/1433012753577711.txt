GrandTen.com/FPD, A big thank you to The Boston Calendar for tacking up an Awesome Fire Puncher Day Post! Tom MaGuire and Tom Brady both know how to handle the Heat!

 On the night of January 24, 1887, flames erupted from the iron foundry in South Boston. Before firemen could reach the fire, local resident Tommy MaGuire climbed a ladder to the roof and, as legend has it, ‚Äúundertook to fight the flames with his fists.‚Äù JUST LIKE TAWMMY BRADY IS GONNA DO TO THE FAHKIN‚Äô SEAHAWKS. MaGuire‚Äôs heroics helped save the foundry that now houses GrandTen Distilling (I mean, firefighters with water helped, too, probably) and inspired their smoky and spicy Fire Puncher Vodka. Stop by GrandTen‚Äôs annual Fire Puncher Day event at Redbones in Davis Square to try some signature cocktails and free appetizers. 1.24. 4p. FREE

A flood of Blackstrap Molasses left a wake of destruction in the North End. Today we pour out a stream of molasses in memory of this great event., Preparing for more #Blackstrap #Molasses #fermentations to distill #GrandTens heirloom #spirit #Medford #Rum., In preparation for Fire Puncher Day 2015, GTD is creating a small batch of our special edition Fire Puncher Black Vodka! We use the same Chipotle peppers in the distillation but age the spicy spirit in used Bourbon Barrels with Taza Chocolate cocao nibs and shells! This completely changes the flavor and gives Fire Puncher Black a nose of roasted chocolate, palate of rich caramel and a finish of smokey black pepper. This 'cocktail in a bottle' is perfect for White Russians, Chocolate Martinis and heated Manhattans. Enjoy this specialty spirit with us at Redbones on January 24th, 4-7pm!, The spicy heart of GrandTen's Fire Puncher Vodka lies in the locally grown chipotle peppers. The Bars Farm in Deerfield, MA cold smokes premium jalape√±os to give them a rich and savory flavor. When these peppers are distilled with our vodka it creates a spirit with a crisp pepper bite and a smokey hickory finish.

Read the last paragraph about Thomas J. Maguire!, Join GrandTen Distilling for FIRE PUNCHER DAY 2015!
Held Saturday, Janurary 24th 4-7pm @ Redbones Restaurant Somerville, MA
Free and Open to the public!

Each year GrandTen Distilling commemorates the rich history of the iron foundry which now houses our South Boston distillery.

It was on this day in 1887 that a fierce fire nearly destroyed the South Boston iron and steel works. We believe our distillery still stands in part from the courageous efforts of one man.  

The Boston Globe recorded that Thomas Maguire fought flames with his fists and had to be removed from the blaze by firemen. 

What emerged from the embers was the legacy of Tommy Maguire‚Äôs fire punching fists and the genesis of our one of a kind Fire Puncher Vodka.
