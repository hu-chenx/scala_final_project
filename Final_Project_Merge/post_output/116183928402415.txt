· Grills must be at least 10 feet from structures or anything that will burn such as foliage, brush, trees.

· Never grill/barbecue in enclosed areas - carbon monoxide could be produced.

· Before using a gas grill, visually inspect and check the fuel line connection.

· Never leave the barbecue grill unattended

· Always have a supply of water or an appropriate portable fire extinguisher nearby.

· Do not wear loose clothing while cooking at a barbecue.

· Do not add fluid to an already lit fire. Flames will flashback up causing severe burns and fire damage.

· Supervise children around outdoor grills and keep matches and lighters away from children.

· Dispose of hot coals properly - douse them with plenty of water, preferably in a metal bucket.

· Stir them and repeat sequence to ensure that the embers have cooled.

· Never place used coals in dumpsters or trash containers.
