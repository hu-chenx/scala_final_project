"This chrome palace, wedged between a donut shop and a bank, is home to undoubtably one of the best jobs I've ever had. I feel grateful when I come through the door to start my shift and I'm greeted with the smiling faces of my co-workers. We work our buns off here, but a day never goes by without a laugh or a pun (I love working on Fridays because I get to make unlimited fry puns).

I'm so happy to have found Firebrand Saints."

It's an environment where, even when I’m busy, I feel like I can be relaxed, in control and still be doing a good job. 

I also like working for Gary. He’s smart and he knows a lot about the business. I feel like I’ve learned a lot from him."

“I’ve worked at Firebrand Saints for maybe 2 and a half years now. It’s a great place to work. Our Chef & Owner Gary Strack was the one who came to me asking if my company, Eye Design, wanted to book shows here. That’s not the type of restaurant you see every day — where the owner let’s you be creative and do what you love. With some Boston venues closing recently, it’s great to be able to support the local scene, and to add another venue to Boston.”, It's a fine day for some frizee!

“I’ve worked at Firebrand Saints for about two years. I really like working in this area, especially having the Cambridge Innovation Center above us. It’s nice to be around so much creativity all the time, and I think it definitely pushes us in the kitchen and behind the bar. It’s a very dynamic working environment compared to other restaurants.

No man can be my equal." - Freddie Mercury, Take a second to talk to the persop next to you (our patio is a great place to do that)....smart phones are both empowering and an epidemic that is drastically changing the way we interact on a moment to moment basis. Everytime there is a police office on detail you see them looking at their phone instead of directing traffic. We all look at our phones while driving. We are so concerned with being the first on to capture the moment that we don't experience the moment spontaneously.
