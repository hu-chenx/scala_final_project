Also thanks for all the little tributes to Sam on Facebook,cards,flowers and all the stories and pictures you shared with us after the funeral.  The little stories of Sam were a side of him we did not know.  We always got just the bare bones of all his trips.
It warms our hearts as well as brings comfort to know Sam had such a league of good friends.  This will help during the long days ahead and through the Holidays.
