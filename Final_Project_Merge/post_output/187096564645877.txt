Please join us as Dr. Ellen Scott, the University of Oregon, and Shauna Dyer, the University of Michigan present their research, "The High Cost of Low Wages" (see abstract below).  

Co-Sponsors: The ARM Lab, Sociology Dept, and Women's Studies Program

The High Cost of Low Wages

In this talk, Scott and Dyer present research using official government statistics on employment and wages and qualitative interviews with workers in Oregon to demonstrate the growth of low-wage work and its effects on workers. Corporations are increasingly relying on a low-wage labor force and replacing middle-income jobs with low-wage jobs, at the same time that there is staggering rise in corporate profits.  Workers, on the other hand, are forced to rely on public benefits to make ends meet, with taxpayers effectively subsidizing corporations through the provision of benefits to workers. Policy implications and changes are considered., Please join us Wed. for Dr. Rob Peralta's Rethinking Gender Talk!

Qualitative inquiries into the process of marginalization and stigma across four domains (HIV/AIDS, interpersonal violence, sexualities, and substance abuse) and the impact of gender and racial socialization on substance use, HIV-Risk, and interpersonal violence are the focus of his current research., http://www.uakron.edu/im/news/portrait-artist-kehinde-wiley-to-deliver-lecture-at-ua/, null, 'The 2016 Vagina Monologues' audition dates are set'

The Latino American Symposium on Education and Research (LASER) is a continuation of the scholarship discussed at the March 6, 2015 Ohio Latino Education Summit hosted by the University of Akron and the Ohio Commission for Hispanic and Latino Affairs. It will serve as a catalyst to discuss research done in the realm of academia regarding Hispanics in the state of Ohio and the Midwest from grade school to career exploration and attainment. The purpose of this symposium is to present cutting-edge research and other scholarship that can in turn become a springboard to develop best practices that will enhance persistence and achievement for Latinos. L.A.S.E.R. will continue to create networks and community coalitions that will pursue expanded opportunities for Latinos year-round. The vision for the Latino American Symposium on Education and Research is to foster continued dialogue about methods that will continue to keep Hispanic Americans achieving those educational milestones for success; by bridging relationships with our teachers, school administrators, higher education and career professionals, the community, policymakers and other key agencies.

, At Black Male Summit, students get life lessons
By Kelli Young
April 11. 2014 11:35PM

Canton City high school students participated for the first time in the University of Akron's Black Male Summit Friday where the group of students, which traditionally have lowest graduation and college attendance rates, learned about the importance of getting a college education and avoiding distractions.

Trajen Wood hopes to one day play in the NBA. But the freshman at Timken High School said he’s considering going to college for a business degree in case the basketball career doesn’t materialize.

Wood, who carries a 3.2 grade-point average, got his first college campus experience Friday when he visited the University of Akron for its seventh annual Black Male Summit. Friday’s agenda included keynote speakers such as comedian and game-show host Steve Harvey and panelists such as David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans. 

Johns, who has been attending similarly focused discussions all over the country, said he has been gathering information from each of the forums that will be used to identify how the federal government can support and promote effective programs as part of President Barack Obama’s national initiative My Brother’s Keeper, which is designed to help young men of color succeed in school and in life.

When Johns asked some of the high school students what additional support they needed to be more successful, their answers included: real food and more food, integrated courses, opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities that are challenging and creative and more educators who care so they don’t feel alone.

“At the end of the day, all of us want to be acknowledged, seen and heard,” Johns said. 

NEW AUDIENCE

Sarah Cupples, spokeswoman for the University of Akron, said while the summit itself is in its seventh year, this is only the second year for the high school component that is meant to get encourage participants to do well in their classes now so they will have the opportunity to go to college.

This is the first year that the Canton City School District has participated in the summit. School spokeswoman Lisa Reicosky said the district accepted the university’s invitation because many of the students, regardless of their achievements in high school, do not see college as an attainable goal.

“We hope this summit will show them that college is a real option for them, and encourages them to pursue all avenues of financial aid opportunities and career options,” Reicosky said.

Timken principal Corey Grubbs said the 49 participants from Timken, McKinley and Early College high schools were picked based on performance; each had at least a 2.5 grade-point average and a good attendance record.

“Any time we can expose students to a college campus is great. It opens their eyes to opportunities,” Grubbs said.

As part of the high school component of the summit, the Canton City students heard from current University of Akron male students through a speed mentoring format, in which each mentor talked for about five minutes to a group of 10 students before moving to the next group. Most of the mentors talked about the distractions they encountered — and the high schoolers also likely will face — as college freshmen. 

“I’ve had a different roommate each year,” said a fourth-year University of Akron student. “They dropped out, they ain’t here anymore. ... They didn’t stay focused on why they were here. They get caught up in the girls, and they get caught up in the partying and don’t get involved in school. It’s all good with the girls and everything, but you got to remember that your No. 1 focus is getting that paper, getting that degree.”

MISSED OPPORTUNITIES

The students also heard from speakers who didn’t take academics seriously at first. Joe Johnson left Milwaukee Bay View High School with a grade-point average of 1.66 and an ACT score of 13. The former high school football and basketball standout said that because of his low academic performance, a Division 1 college passed on him.

“I wish I would have did what I needed to do when I was in high school because I missed out ... because of my grades,” said Johnson, who started his collegiate sports career at a community college.

Johnson, now a recruiter and mentoring program coordinator at the University of Florida, said students need to understand the importance of what he calls the four P’s: You are a Product of the People you Place in your Presence.

“I get tired of some of my students who say they want to be on the honor roll but they only hang with folks that don’t want to go to class,” Johnson said. “I get tired of people telling me they want to be a superstar on the basketball team, but they’re too busy on the streets, hanging on the corner.” 

Adam Smith, assistant vice president of student success at the University of Akron, cited Erick Howard, former Hoover High School football standout twice named Mr. Football in Ohio who is now serving a 30-year prison sentence, as an example of how athletic performance isn’t necessarily enough. 

“In order to be on the field of life, you have to do what it takes right now,” he said.

Smith said Friday won’t be the last time that the Canton City students will hear from the mentors they met during the summit as he listed a series of events that are being planned over the next year. He said the goal is to encourage the students to go to college — even if it’s not at the University of Akron.

“This isn’t about recruiting,” he said. “This is about aspiration.”
