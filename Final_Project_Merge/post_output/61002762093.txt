© Jurate Rutkauskas | JuratePhotography 2015, pree-mie: (noun) A little bit of heaven sent down to earth early so you can witness a miracle in the making

Today is World's Prematurity Awareness day. Those that are close to me know,  that I am a mama of a preemie, a boy born at 28 weeks 2lb 2 oz and 12 inches long. While I don't wish this experience on anyone, surviving 77 long days in the NICU and months that followed, was truly watching a miracle happening in front of our own eyes. Today he is completely healthy happy thriving almost 6 year old. We are forever grateful to all the NICU nurses and doctors that saved our boy and thanking our lucky stars. Not every story ends the way ours did. We were truly lucky and will never forget how fragile life can be. My son is the reason I do what I do.

Senior sessions season has  officially begun now !, This page hasn't been updated in almost two weeks. Took few weeks easy to take care of couple health issues ( nothing too serious! ) And just in time, as the busy season sure has begun here!  In the meantime, would love to post this session I did a week ago as a volunteer for The Tiny Footprints Program. Photographers all over the US donating their time to help families capture some memories with their little ones during these stressful times at NICU. It is a gift to parents as well as extremely rewarding and healing for me, personally.

An awesome opportunity and must apply before May 1st., Week 11  is on the blog ! , Neglected my FB page for last couple weeks while being busy on the back end . First off, catching up on the blog. Here is week 10 of my project 52. Week 11 and 12 will be blogged in the next couple days. Some client sessions are being prepared for blog as well. Stay tuned! , So excited I got approved to be a volunteer photographer for TheTinyFootprintsProject. One of the main reasons I chose this organization was my now 4 year old son, who was born 11 weeks premature and spent 77 days in the NICU. I so wish there was a photographer available at that time to capture some of those memories. We are the lucky ones to leave the NICU healthy and strong and now it is time to give back. If you know moms with babies in NICU right now, please spread the word about this wonderful organization and that there are photography services available for them, absolutely free of charge  at this difficult and yet most important time of their life.

To this day Preeclampsia remains the number one cause of maternal and fetal mortality.
Most of you know that my son Rokas was born almost 3 month premature due to this scary disease. My son and I are lucky to be survivors and grateful for such good outcome but will never the ones we met who were less fortunate and never made it. 
I have hope that one day we will find a cause and a cure for preeclampsia.  Today like every year we will  come together to remember those who passed and celebrate those who survived at 
Boston Promise Walk for Preeclampsia. This year i am not only doing the walk , I am also volunteering my photography services trying to help in ways that I can., Quick sneak peek from probably one of the last beach sessions of the season. Beautiful mommy and such a handsome boy who happens to share the same name with my son :), This is what I am working on right now.  More to come ! Gearing up to editing marathon this week- many sessions to work on. Stay tuned :)
