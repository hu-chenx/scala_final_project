Earlier this year, Maine's legislature passed a law granting same sex couples the right to marry. On election day (one week!) Maine citizens will be asked to strip that right away with Proposition 1, which would overturn the marriage equality law. Luke's supports equal rights for all Mainers, so we're encouraging Maine ex-pats to vote NO on Prop 1. To bolster the cause, this Thursday we'll donate $1 for every roll we sell to the No on 1 Campaign.
