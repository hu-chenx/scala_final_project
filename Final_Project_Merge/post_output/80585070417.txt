5. They‚Äôre Generous
The dynamic duo is originally from Akron, and once launched a charity t-shirt, to raise money for the West Akron Baseball League, the baseball little league they used to play in as children.

4. They‚Äôre All About Their Fans
They were once offered a six-digit sum to put their music in a Hellman‚Äôs mayonnaise commercial, but turned it down because they didn't want to alienate their fan base. 

3. They‚Äôre Varying Heights
There is a seven inch height difference between Dan and Pat, which they both claim ‚Äústill make hugs awkward.‚Äù

2. They Should Keep Their Day Jobs
One of lead singer Dan Auerbach‚Äôs prior jobs included handing out flyers. However, that job lasted only two hours because his boss discovered 600 of those flyers thrown in a sewer.

JOHN B. RICKETTS: Nearly 220 years ago, he introduced the circus to American audiences.

HOLD YOUR HORSES: Today this means to be patient. In earlier days, before cars, spectators came on horses to see the circus parade.
