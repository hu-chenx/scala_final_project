His name is synonymous with freedom, hope and dignity. The father of today's democratic and multi-racial South Africa. He became the country's first black President in 1994. Nelson Mandela, also known as "Madiba" - who passed away in 2013 at the age of 95 - was, without a doubt, one of the world's most influential spokesmen on human rights. His name is now revered all around the world. 

Today, in collaboration with the House of Mandela foundation created by the family of the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Hublot has decided to pay tribute to him by unveiling the Classic Fusion House of Mandela. It is a homage both to his exceptional character, and to the legacy that he has left to not only his family, but humanity as a whole.

His good idea came in 2005, when he came up with the name "BIG BANG". In fact, the term "BIG BANG" is based on an idea which is central to the art of fusion: the combining of objects and materials which never appear together under normal conditions, for example rubber and gold.

The incorporation of the various production stages into the manufacture since Spring 2009 has enabled HUBLOT to produce the UNICO chronograph, which was developed exclusively by its own Research & Development Department. 

The machining workshop produces bridges, main plates and various steel components, which are assembled by watchmakers specially assigned to this task. A special feature of this flyback chronograph is the position of its mechanism and the famous ¬´column wheel¬ª on the side of the dial.

He is the only footballer to have been three-times world champion, in 1958, 1962 and 1970, with the Brazilian team. He amassed an incredible array of honours with the two professional clubs he played for (Santos FC and New York Cosmos), winning the Intercontinental Cup (1962 and 1963), the Copa Libertadores (1962 and 1963), the North American Soccer League (1977) and the S√£o Paulo championship (ten times) in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

Since his retirement from sport, Pel√© has been an ambassador for the UN and UNESCO for Education, Ecology and the Environment. He was Brazil's minister for sport from 1995 to 1998. However, he has not retired from football altogether, and still serves as a spokesman, ambassador and philanthropist. He is actively supporting his country in its preparations for the 2014 competition.

The fabulous event has been organized at the Yacht Club de Monaco in connection with the 22nd Monaco Yacht Show., Mike Tyson- Warrior!
 
Mike Tyson is one of the most spectacular champions of all times. A two-time heavyweight world champion and a 1980‚Äôs superstar, Tyson is the youngest boxer to become World Heavyweight Champion. 

A Brooklyn, New York, native, Tyson was born on June 30th, 1966. The young Tyson overcame a tough childhood, raised by his mother and joining a street gang by the age of eleven. Following several arrests, Tyson found himself at the Tryon House, a rehabilitation center in upstate New York. 

It was then that Bob Stewart entered Tyson‚Äôs life and changing it forever. A former boxer, Stewart taught him to channel his aggression and strength through boxing- a sport that helped him discover a new life. Stewart introduced him to legendary trainer Cus D‚ÄôAmato, who not only took care of the teenager as his manager and mentor, but became his legal guardian. 

The reformed Tyson began his professional debut on March 6, 1985 against Puerto Rican fighter, "The Tank." Hector Mercedes. Tyson rapidly Knocked Out the Puerto Rican hero, showing his strength with the first punch. In his first two years as a professional, Mike Tyson won all 27 fights of which 25 ended by knockout and 15 of them in the first round!

On November 22, 1986, Mike got his first world title shot, when facing to Trevor Berbick. That night, Tyson, becoming a knock out king, was crowned the new monarch by knocking out his opponent in the second round. At just 20 years and 4 months, Tyson became the youngest heavyweight world champion in the history of boxing. On March 16, 1996 Mike Tyson knocked out Frank Bruno in the third round to recover his WBC heavyweight title. In 2005, the legendary Tyson announced his retirement from boxing after more than 20 years of thrilling the world with through extraordinary bouts. 

Since his retirement from boxing, Mike has become an actor, appearing on television and in multiple movies. Most recently, he has presented his own refreshingly honest and innovative show in Las Vegas, which will soon debut on Broadway under the direction of Spike Lee. 

Happy, contented and an adored family man, Mike Tyson is a Legendary Boxer, Champion, and the ultimate Warrior.

This partnership is a story of friendship, real friendship; a human story. It is about mutual loyalty based on the shared passion for the sea and sailing, love of sport, the quest for performance and for cutting-edge technological innovation both in terms of materials and original technical developments. It is also about a powerful tie to Swiss Made and the Swiss colours. The two bosses, Ernesto Bertarelli and Jean-Claude Biver, have a shared set of values, as well as a shared concept of team spirit, hard work and effort, and the value of respect.

The second boat ‚Äì the D√©cision 35 Alinghi - will be in action on Lake Geneva. It sets sail from Geneva the first weekend in May ‚Äì from the 3rd to 6th ‚Äì in the Grand Prix Les Ambassadeurs.

Ernesto Bertarelli remarked: "It is a great pleasure to welcome Hublot back on board Alinghi, and an honour to have it as a partner given its track record supporting the world's biggest sporting events, from FIFA to Formula 1 to mention but a few!".
Jean-Claude Biver, Chairman of Hublot, added: "Hublot is yet again demonstrating through this partnership its commitment to promoting Swiss values and Swiss technology; the fundamental values of Swiss Made, to which watchmaking as a whole is privileged to refer.", APRIL 18-20th 13:30 CET EACH DAY - LIVE replay sessions from Qingdao in China, with a special Hublot announcement tomorrow...!
