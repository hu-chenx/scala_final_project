http://bostoncommon-magazine.com/frozen-cocktails-to-drink-in-the-summer, null, We hope this doesn't come across as insincere for an alcohol producing company to raise the alarm over an addiction crisis not involving the product we make. Alcoholism is a serious disease worthy of our attention and support. But today, we'd like to take a moment away from our PR and address a community issue that is not garnering the attention it deserves and requires. The Northeast is in the midst of the ravages of a heroin epidemic. Our own little bucolic town of Ipswich is not immune to this evolving scourge. In fact, we are finding ourselves more and more in the middle of the storm. We don't profess to have the answers but we believe that, as a town, we haven't even started asking the right questions. Social stigma and the moralizing attitude we have used in addressing drug addiction in the past now stands in the way of a true understanding of the depth of the problem at hand. Perhaps we are not the best forum for this discussion. But as a local business that's not only from this community, but invested in this community, we feel it's our responsibility to, at the very least, illuminate this crisis in the hopes of ending the cycle of addiction and deaths. If this post comes as a surprise to you. Please read the linked article for a glimpse into the changing face of heroin addiction. We look forward to your thoughts and suggestions.

http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/food/2013/11/26/boozy-holiday-gift-guide/LJBHV6av1aZDXXz8OJKiYJ/pictures.html, Had the pleasure of finally meeting Ned from New England Distilling this past Friday. Great guy making great spirits up in Portland, ME. His wonderful spirits are available here in MA too in limited quantities. , From our great friends at Slumbrew:
The funny thing about holiday beer is that you have to start planning in the spring. We had requests from our retailers for a Christmas Beer. If you aren't familiar, “Yankee Swap” is an age-old game played in New England by families and businesses. (Jeff once got an almanac, Caitlin got salted peanuts and Adam gave a Justin Timberlake action figure. Anyhoo...) For the past two years we’ve been working with our pals at Turkey Shore Distilleries. We use the “tails” of their rum to disinfect our roasted cocoa nibs that go in Porter Square Porter. When 40 of their rum barrels became available to we happily purchased them for a barrel-aging project. This is a high ABV holiday sipper meant to give, collect and cellar. We love to collect beers that age well and series beers. Stone Vertical Epic is an example. Yankee Swap will be an annual series with slight changes to each year's edition. It was actually difficult to procure enough grade-B Local maple syrup. We actually asked our Slumbrew fan nation on Facebook and found North Hadley Sugar Shack.Our pals at Cuisine en Locale of Somerville hauled it all back from Hadley when purchasing their own syrup, so suddenly there was quite a team effort to get the ingredients to the brew day. Our goal was to create the item in the Yankee Swap that you would certainly think twice about before passing to the left. So now you have the the story behind Yankee Swap. We hope you enjoy. Slainte!, Is this the line for the Old Ipswich rum tasting? ;-), You had me at rum! "Snow blows off the harbor at Newburyport, Massachusetts, carrying whispers of clipper ships. They glide in from the Atlantic, these ghosts from the past, weary from the West Indies, laden with molasses destined to become rum."

Turkey Shore Distilleries Wins Awards for Old Ipswich Tavern Style & Old Ipswich Golden Marsh Spiced Rum
New England Spirits Gain High Marks in Nationwide Industry Event

Ipswich, MA, Nov. 15, 2012 –Turkey Shore Distilleries, maker of Old Ipswich Rum, was awarded two medals at the Ministry of Rum (http://www.ministryofrum.com) event held recently in Chicago in October. The event was organized by Ed Hamilton and was judged by industry professionals, writers, consultants and mixologists. Hamilton is regarded as the world’s foremost expert on sugarcane spirits and the author of two books: Rums of the Eastern Caribbean and The Complete Guide to Rum: An Authoritative Guide to Rums of the World. 

Sugar cane spirits were judged for their aroma, initial taste, body and finish.
 
Turkey Shore Distilleries won a Silver Medal in the Flavored Rum category for its new limited edition spirit, Old Ipswich Golden Marsh Spiced Rum. The judges noted that Golden Marsh is “a light brown, spiced rum distilled from fermented molasses. Blended from aged and fresh rums, spices and natural flavors, the orange background label pumpkin is the first aroma to be identified when the bottle is opened. The second sniff reveals the baking spices used to flavor this rum - cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Hints of citrus peel are evident in the initial taste, while the fresh rum component of this spiced rum can't be ignored in the finish.”

Old Ipswich Tavern Style Rum won a Gold Medal in the Dark Rum category. The judges remarked that “Opening the bottle for the first time, [we noted] aromas of ripe citrus and cinnamon bark. The initial taste is fairly lean with notes of stewed apricot and a slightly viscous mouth feel. The body yields to warm, dry spice tones of cardamon in the finish.” Old Ipswich Tavern Style Rum also was named Best of Class Rum at the 2012 American Distilling Institute annual conference earlier this year.

Consumers can find Old Ipswich Rum for sale at liquor stores and served in select restaurants in the greater Boston area and throughout Massachusetts. 

“By using table-grade molasses in a custom copper pot still and focusing on small batches, we are crafting premium products. We are honored to gain this acclaim from our peers and those in the know in the spirits industry,” said Mathew Perry, President and Founder of Turkey Shore Distilleries. 

Perry and Distiller Evan Parker have a personal connection to the history of rum in Ipswich. They grew up on Turkey Shore Road, where a distillery operated from 1770-1836. Barrels of molasses that originated in the West Indies were unloaded at an old wharf located in Mat’s back yard along the Ipswich River. The barrels were then rolled back and forth across the street from Hunt’s Wharf to the distillery. Now, more than 175 years later, Turkey Shore Distilleries once again sits along the banks of the Ipswich River, ready to revive the ancient tradition of producing New England rum.

About Turkey Shore Distilleries
Turkey Shore Distilleries LLC is the maker of Old Ipswich Rum, a line of award-winning, artisanal spirits. Old Ipswich Tavern-Style Rum won Gold Medals for Amber Rum and Best of Class Rum, and the Old Ipswich White Cap Rum won a Bronze Medal in the Clear Rum category at the 2012 American Distilling Institute’s Craft Distilling Conference. Formed in 2010 by Mat Perry and Evan Parker in the historic coastal town of Ipswich, MA, Turkey Shore Distilleries aims to reconnect New Englanders to a significant part of their past. They use table-grade sweet molasses from the sugarcane fields of Louisiana and a 250-gallon copper pot still built in Kentucky to create a true American product to awaken the New England spirit in all of us. Old Ipswich Rum is available at bars, restaurants and liquor stores. In addition, Turkey Shore Distilleries is open from 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. for tours and tastings at 23 Hayward St. in Ipswich.

RUM CHRISTMAS CAKE

Once again this year, I’ve had requests for my Rum Christmas Cake recipe so here goes. Please keep in your files as I am beginning to get tired of typing this up every year! (Made mine this morning!!!!) 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 cup water, 1 tsp. salt , 1 cup brown sugar, Lemon juice, 4 large eggs, Nuts, 1 bottle of Rum and 2 cups dried fruit.

Sample a cup of Rum to check quality. Take a large bowl, check the Rum again to be sure it is of the highest quality then Repeat. Turn on the electric mixer. Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar. Beat again. At this point, it is best to make sure the Rum is still OK. Try another cup just in case. Turn off the mixerer thingy. Break 2 eegs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried fruit. Pick the fruit up off the floor, wash it and put it in the bowl a piece at a time trying to count it. Mix on the turner. If the fried druit getas stuck in the beaterers, just pry it loose with a drewscriver Sample the Rum to test for tonsisticity. Next, sift 2 cups of salt, or something. Check the Rum. Now shit shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts. Add one table. Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can find. Greash the oven. Turn the cake tin 360 degrees and try not to fall over. Don't forget to beat off the turner. Finally, throw the bowl through the window. Finish the Rum and wipe the counter with the dog . ♥ A winning christmas cake I am sure, hee hee! xoxo, Our fellow Americans who were in the path of Sandy still need our help.

Turkey Shore Distilleries Launches Limited Edition Old Ipswich Golden Marsh Spiced Rum
New Spirit Perfect for Fall & Winter Cocktails

Ipswich, MA, Oct. 4, 2012 – North Shore micro-distiller Turkey Shore Distilleries, whose Old Ipswich Tavern-Style Rum was named Best of Class Rum at the 2012 American Distilling Institute annual conference,  has released a new limited edition spirit, Old Ipswich Golden Marsh Spiced Rum. Golden Marsh Spiced Rum is handcrafted with a blend of aged and unaged rums that is steeped with 10 different spices to achieve a delicious, smooth rum bursting with the flavors of the season. Consumers can find it for sale at liquor stores and served in select restaurants in the greater Boston area and throughout Massachusetts. 

“We took a page from the handbook of microbrewers that issue special, limited beers and larger distillers that are capitalizing on the popularity of flavored spirits, such as vodka. Consumers like to explore new tastes so we are responding with a seasonal twist on our award-winning Old Ipswich Rum,” said Mathew Perry, President and Founder of Turkey Shore Distilleries. “We believe in using premium, locally sourced ingredients to create our spirits.” 

Distilled from molasses in a custom copper pot still, Old Ipswich rum uses small batch process to produce a sophisticated rum worthy of its New England heritage. “With the cooler weather, we created a flavor profile that is perfect for those crisp days out and about or for those cold nights by the fire. For a simple, tasty cocktail, you can pair Golden Marsh Spiced Rum with ginger beer or hot cider,” said Master Distiller Evan Parker. 

Perry and Parker have a personal connection to the history of rum in Ipswich. They grew up on Turkey Shore Road, where a distillery operated from 1770-1836. Barrels of molasses that originated in the West Indies were unloaded at an old wharf located in Mat’s back yard along the Ipswich River. The barrels were then rolled back and forth across the street from Hunt’s Wharf to the distillery. Now, more than 175 years later, Turkey Shore Distilleries once again sits along the banks of the Ipswich River, ready to revive the ancient tradition of producing New England rum.

About Turkey Shore Distilleries
Turkey Shore Distilleries LLC is the maker of Old Ipswich Rum, a line of award-winning, artisanal spirits. Old Ipswich Tavern-Style Rum won Gold Medals for Amber Rum and Best of Class Rum, and the Old Ipswich White Cap Rum won a Bronze Medal in the Clear Rum category at the 2012 American Distilling Institute’s Craft Distilling Conference. Formed in 2010 by Mat Perry and Evan Parker in the historic coastal town of Ipswich, MA, Turkey Shore Distilleries aims to reconnect New Englanders to a significant part of their past. They use table-grade sweet molasses from the sugarcane fields of Louisiana and a 250-gallon copper pot still built in Kentucky to create a true American product to awaken the New England spirit in all of us. Old Ipswich Rum is available at bars, restaurants and liquor stores. In addition, Turkey Shore Distilleries is open from 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. for tours and tastings at 23 Hayward St. in Ipswich.
