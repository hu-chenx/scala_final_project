Charlotte Radiology will have their Mobile Breast Center on-site at Bank of America stadium to provide the screenings and the participants will be taken care of further if an issue is identified at the event that day and additional exams or a biopsy is necessary.
 
DeAngelo Williams chose to sponsor 53 women annually when his mother, Sandra Hill, passed away in May from metastatic breast cancer, breast cancer that ultimately traveled to her liver and became terminal. Prior to his mother passing, Williams had four aunts that lost their battles with breast cancer, all before the age of 50. Sandra had just turned 53 years old the week before losing her battle and had stated that she felt like she had stolen three years of life. Williams saw 53 as a significant number to commemorate the legacy of his mother’s life.
 
Simultaneous to the sponsored screenings, The DeAngelo Williams Foundation will also have a fundraiser at Bank of America stadium. The Wine Palette will host three painting sessions for registered individuals to paint a specially designed PINK Christmas portrait.  The cost of the event is $50 and individuals can register at The Wine Palette website or at http://www.thewinepalettenc.com/calendar/december/299-53-strong-for-sandra-the-deangelo-williams-foundation-paint-panther-stadium Fifty percent of the ticket price will benefit The DeAngelo Williams Foundation., 100% of the proceeds (from the sales of this GREAT holiday gift) go directly to The DeAngelo Williams Foundation!!!, Here's a long TD run from my memphis days (in honor of anticipating today being one of the best days in recent memory for my tigers!) http://www.sqor.com/posts/e33bf481-ab0f-4df2-bc80-67468d6e3e53/uid/31031, Recently read this to the kiddos and highly recommend it!, A true prankster is able to embrace the rare times when he becomes the prank victim! lol, This one was personally "delivered" by me (if u know what i mean lol), All gone now obviously but yea u want to come to the williams household on thanksgiving next yr dont u?!! lol, My little batwoman loves corn on the cob!!, Anyone want dessert?!?, Panther Pride!, Ever put your child to work around the house not because work needed to be done but because u wanted to tire them out so they'd sleep through the night?? not saying i have or haven't just wondering if u have! lol, Me when that field goal sailed through the uprights lol, null, I see you steve!!!

Why, you ask? Well, I think the fact that I only recently heard about metastatic breast cancer (while learning that it's what took the lives of my mom & 4 aunties) speaks volumes about the need to raise awareness of the terminal disease.

I am on a mission to do just that and hope you'll help spread the word so that we can soon live in a world where no one will have to hear the word "hospice" associated with this disease ever again..., So wait is it ok that i kind of just celebrated? #awkwardmoment lol, No matter what happens (we're gonna win) i couldn't be more proud of my teammates for the way they've fought all day!, #yeswecam, Let's go d we got this!!! #panthernation, TOUCHDOWN!!!, I dressed up my cat & dog...now it's your turn. upload your panther-ized pet pic here Tostitos #sp:  http://tostitospartychallenge.com
