Courtside Karaoke happens every Thursday, Friday and Saturday in the sprawling back room of a dingy dive where wizened drinkers hold court at the bar. This is karaoke as it was meant to be sung. The master of ceremonies takes his job seriously, making sure that no show-boater hogs more than his fair share of the mic, and affably brusque waitresses serve up pitchers of cheap beer and cheaper bar snacks to long folding tables of singers and attentive listeners. In short: perfection.

This über-dive is home to Boston’s most famous karaoke regular, Mark Hoffman, a.k.a. Mark the Shark, who gets the crowd going with his intense renditions. While waiting to take the stage (and given its popularity/infamy, you will have to wait), take advantage of the cheap drinks (think $12 pitchers of beer) and waffle fries.  Thu–Sat 9pm–1am. Free.
