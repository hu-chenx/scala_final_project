We are checking out some new space today not that far away, stay tuned for updates!, The Cafe Quattro Crew, To our valued customers and friends:
As you may have heard, we have lost our lease at Cafe Quattro.  On August 1 we were given 30 days to vacate by our landlord, Divco West.  We gave them 7 years, they gave us 30 days.  We have never been late on the rent, and we have an excellent relationship with everyone in our building.  This is happening because they want to build a large upscale restaurant and bar that would take up the entire first floor of our building.  Over the past month, we have done everything we could to extend our time, but over the past week it has escalated to the point that we have to go.  Monday will be our last day of full operation and we hope many of you will stop in.  We are trying very hard to find a new location.  This is a very difficult situation to be in, but we are not going away, we are going to do it somewhere else bigger and better!  Please stay tuned for any updates and thank you so much for your support!
