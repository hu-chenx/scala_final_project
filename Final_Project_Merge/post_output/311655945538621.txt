Trick or Treaters welcome starting at 4pm., This Halloween weekend, mix holiday fun with history and explore the Hancock Cemetery. Across the street from our neighbor, the United First Parish Church, Quincy's Hancock Cemetery dates from the earliest years of European settlement and was the community’s main burial ground until 1854. Early Puritans took a pragmatic attitude towards death and burial: grave markers were often impermanent or non-existent and the cattle roamed freely here. Consequently, many more people are buried there than there are existing markers. Learn more by clicking on the numbers in the map (link below) for grave descriptions.
