Tasty addition to the neighborhood #coppersmithcafe, Jenna, so glad you had a good time, thank you for sharing this on Boston Chic Party!

My first order of business was picking a venue. I looked around at a few venues in Boston before settling on the perfect one, Coppersmith. The exposed brick inside, amazing beer list and tons of natural light pouring through the windows made it a winner for me. It‚Äôs the perfect place for a guy‚Äôs party in Boston. Courtney who is charge of events there was so nice throughout the entire process- I really can‚Äôt recommend working with her enough. Besides the awesome vibe of the venue and the beer selection, food was important to me and with her help, we created a snack menu all the party guests were raving about. My personal favorite was the chicken & waffles- adorable pieces of fried chicken on a yummy waffle and drizzled with syrup, all on a skewer to eat hands free., Spring plans including St. Patrick's Day & Parade Day...Roof Deck + Patio Launch...Easter...Derby Day are all in the works, among other upcoming sporting events as well.

Why It's Hot: You can't really call this South Boston newcomer that's housed inside a former copper foundry "just a bar." It's the Swiss Army knife of local venues, a massive, multifaceted operation with a 350-seat dining room (with two fixed food trucks serving separate menus), coffee bar and cafe, ground-level patio and rooftop deck. But there's no doubt that the 100-ft. bar, made of reclaimed wood and ship hull, is the centerpiece of the space., We'll be cooking alongside great local restaurants at the Chefs Cooking for Hope 2016 on Thursday March 3rd. Tickets are still available, get them before they run out!, null, This week's "Don't you wish you were on vacation!" Food truck specials include Caribbean inspired items like: Jamaican jerk wings- ginger spices, and herbs $9

Hahahah those of you who know me well.....know this is amazing...on multiple fronts...., Thank you to all who came out for this past weekend's #SundayFundayTailgate 
with dueling food truck menus! Stay tuned for news about the upcoming weekend as well as holiday updates and menu changes!, Urban Foodie Finds Coppersmith:
We're so happy you found us and enjoyed your visit Kerrie!

Coppersmith is one of Southie‚Äôs newest additions, so I decided to check them out for an early Birthday celebration this weekend. It‚Äôs a bar and restaurant with food trucks inside, so you can order traditional entrees from the kitchen or tapas style dishes from the food truck menu. The space is big and open, and if you order from the food trucks you can watch your dishes being prepared from the dining room.

When we sat down, we were greeted immediately with a basket of BBQ popcorn. The flavor was subtle, and I loved the idea!  We started with a couple of appetizers including the beef carpaccio made with aged ribeye, parmesan vinaigrette, and fried capers and a few of each of the oysters for the evening. Both were excellent, especially the combination of the parmesan and fried capers with the carpaccio. I ordered the scallops for my main course, which were presented beautifully and tasted even better with sides of grapefruit, quinoa, and cauliflower puree. I stole a few bites of the fiance‚Äôs roasted chicken with braised onions and kale, and it was also delicious. The skin was perfectly crisp which is exactly how I like it. The duck fat potatoes were big enough to be an entree on their own; we barely made a dent in these despite how good they were!

My favorite part was the dessert menu; almost every choice had chocolate which is always my favorite. I went for the candy bar with chocolate, toasted fluff, dulce de leche, and hazelnuts. It was just as good as it looked, although I enjoyed the fiance‚Äôs bread pudding with whiskey, caramel, and bacon just as much! We didn‚Äôt try any of the options from the food trucks, so I‚Äôll definitely have to make a trip back just for those in the near future!, null, #sundayfundaytailgate lunchtime!

Today we're tapping a Harpoon Brewery Winter Warmer keg as our newest monthly "Social Impact Tap." For each beer that is sold, $1 will be donated to The South Boston Athletic Association, with Coppersmith matching each $1 donation!

Coppersmith is proud to be working together with Bob Ferrara and all those working with and for these organizations that help South Boston's youth. Thank you in advance all those who choose to drink from this tap for this cause!

It'd be impossible to open a bakery cafe space in #boston without acknowledging @flourbakeryandcafe and all the amazing things they have done. Joanne with her team single handedly changed the image of what a cafe bakery in Boston could be. One of the countless things they did is create what many consider to be the benchmark for a Boston bakery space with their pecan sticky bun. I would be remiss to open without a version of this now Boston staple. This recipe is a culmination of many tips and individual recipes of many of my culinary role models. Either through working with them or through their published recipes. Here is the middle stages of the @coppersmithbos #bacon pecan sticky bun. Due to the amount of love and energy that goes into this process we will only be offering this two days a week to start and selling them until they sell out. Stay tuned for more details! #pastry #pastrychef #southiefoodie, Previewing as a special today: Steak Salad with Charred Tomatoes, Olives & Feta. A bunch of new specials and items rolling out in the coming weeks - stay tuned! #southiefoodie #southboston #eatinsouthie #bostonfoodies, Switching things up starting this weekend:

Dining with a conscience

South Boston, especially the Seaport, has become a hub for new restaurants, such as Babbo Pizzeria e Enoteca, which opened last week on Fan Pier and marked celebrity chef Mario Batali‚Äôs Boston debut. Now another Southie restaurant is in the works, this one with a socially conscious twist.

Called Coppersmith, it will train and employ Boston Public Schools students with disabilities. About six students will have paid jobs at the restaurant doing food prep and working in its grab-and-go cafe, and another four will have custodial positions.

The training will be done in partnership with Bunker Hill Community College‚Äôs culinary arts program and Triangle, a Malden nonprofit that helps people with disabilities. Funding for the training comes in part from the State Street Foundation.

‚ÄúWe want to be a model for other hospitality establishments to follow,‚Äù said co-owner John Childs, who runs Building Restoration Services.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not charity jobs,‚Äù added Jeff Gentry of Triangle. ‚ÄúThe idea is more inclusion and getting people involved in the workforce in a supportive way.‚Äù

Coppersmith is scheduled to open next month.

In-the-Moment Ingredients, Globally Inspired Flavors, and ‚ÄòSocial-Ability‚Äô Define the Offerings for the Newest Addition to Southie‚Äôs Booming Culinary Landscape

BOSTON (April 29th, 2015) ‚Äì ‚ÄúAfter years in fine dining, it‚Äôs been invigorating to be able to take such an adventurous and cheeky approach to cooking again.‚Äù says former Barbara Lynch Gruppo alumnus and freshly appointed Coppersmith Executive Chef Chris Henry. He quips, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm literally playing with food again - focusing on flavors while challenging the idea of what is considered mainstream dining.‚Äù Coppersmith‚Äôs dynamic concept includes a rooftop raw bar, dueling kitchens, urban agriculture, and casual dining providing Henry with a wide gastronomic berth to showcase his talent and originality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a foodie playground!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a deliciously entertaining process to be a part of‚Äù says Red Door Hospitality consultant and restaurant developer Travis ‚ÄòTbone‚Äô Talbot. ‚ÄúChris has an impressive range of skills. In addition to being included in Coppersmith‚Äôs menu evolution, I have been fortunate to have worked with Chris on a number of charity events and continue to be impressed with how he uses classical techniques to create approachable comfort foods.‚Äù Recent events like the brunch for the Boston Firefighters Burn Foundation, St. Baldrick‚Äôs Foundation Fundraiser, and Benefit for Minds that Matter impressed the crowds with dishes like Nutella stuffed French Toast, Sambal and citrus confit chicken wings, and pressed duck Cubanos.

For the inaugural menu and spring opening, Chef Henry is focused on sticking with Coppersmith‚Äôs ‚Äòlocalvore‚Äô agenda of working with local purveyors to highlight seasonal ingredients. Farmer‚Äôs market salads, daily hand-crafted Agnolotti, soft shell crab BLT sandwiches, organic ¬Ω chicken done 3 ways, and seafood boils on the patios complement local New England favorites like grass-fed steak tip frites and Lobster Rolls. Chef Henry is also a supporter of the ‚Äòsample and share‚Äô approach to eating, encouraging diners to let loose and, ‚Äúeat their way through the menu not just read it.‚Äù From bar snacks like house cured beef jerky, to shared appetizers like his signature Bloomin‚Äô Tempura Oyster Mushroom, to family style dinners like the Moroccan lamb and couscous ‚ÄòButcher Blocks‚Äô, the entire menu encourages exploration. Chef Henry refers to the spirit of his menu by saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about the social-ability which refers to our efforts to source sustainable products and creating dishes that encourage social interaction.‚Äù

Chef Henry continues to develop his menu including hosting tastings at venues like Tavern Road and participating in local community events like the Food Fight series against Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar held at Lincoln in support of No Kid Hungry where his next dish is a crispy pork belly taco braised in duck fat and pineapple juice, with pickled radish, queso fresco, salsa verde, shaved fresh jalape√±os, and avocado crema.

 New South Boston Caf√© / Restaurant Promoting Community and Accessible Careers

BOSTON (April 6th, 2015) ‚Äì A team of restaurateurs and social innovators are working zealously to become a facilitator of opportunity in the heart of the South Boston. ‚ÄúWe named the restaurant Coppersmith,‚Äù says co-owner John Childs, ‚Äúin part, as a tribute to a time when this industrial building was teeming with craftsmen and an anchor of the community.‚Äù When the repurposed, spacious, and rustic restaurant opens later this spring; it will be known both for its globally inspired, hand-crafted fare, and for being a social foundry forging bright new careers. 

Coppersmith‚Äôs mission is to make a difference and inspire smiles. The ‚ÄòCommunity Impact Partnership‚Äô with Triangle ‚Äì a leading nonprofit that offers inventive career and life development opportunities for people with disabilities ‚Äì fits the mission perfectly. When professionals in the Seaport or Fort Channel districts pick up chef inspired grab-and-go lunches, or meet with colleagues for a George Howell Flat Black, they will appreciate smiling service by a caf√© team that includes Bostonians with disabilities. 

General Manager Paul Bruno notes, ‚ÄúHospitality is about great food, a social atmosphere, and genuine connections, but it‚Äôs also about helping and sustainable giving. By eating at Coppersmith, you won‚Äôt just be supporting an organization (‚ÄòDining It Forward‚Äô), you‚Äôll be helping to jump-start the career of a neighbor who will be contributing to our communities for years to come.‚Äù

Every member of the Coppersmith-Triangle caf√© team will have completed a newly developed culinary training program at Bunker Hill Community College. They will continue to be supported by the likes of Joel Costanzo, former manager of the award-winning Atomic Caf√© on the North Shore who currently works at Triangle empowering dozens of youth with disabilities to become valued members of the workforce. Costanzo notes, ‚ÄúIt will be exciting to see graduates of this pioneering program build careers with a focus on serving their neighbors.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCoppersmith is a uniquely accessible space.‚Äù says Michael Rodrigues, Triangle‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer. The construction build, including custom fabrication of furniture by BRS Corp. and Fast Track Fabrication, has been done with the intention of making all dining areas, caf√© spaces, and offerings accessible to all.

Coppersmith is opening in early spring. The Coppersmith-Triangle Caf√© team is preparing for their culinary arts classes at Bunker Hill Community College and are on-track to start serving customers in early July.

BOSTON (March 26th, 2015) ‚Äì one week after the announcement of his appointment as head of culinary operations for Coppersmith, Executive Chef Chris Henry is giving Boston foodies a sneak peek of his opening menu. ‚ÄúIt will definitely be an eclectic menu as I draw inspiration mainly from what I like to eat. Although we will use techniques and philosophies similar to those in fine dining environments, I want the food to be as approachable, friendly, and fun as the space and concept itself.‚Äù With a background in classic French techniques, and applauded for his modern bar food creations during his tenure with the Barbara Lynch Gruppo (9 at Home and Drink), Chef Chris definitely possesses the chops to dish out elevated and innovative offerings. 

On his approach to crafting the menu, Chef Chris continues to reinforce the idea of simplicity; presenting familiar and traditional dishes with adventurous ‚Äòupdates‚Äô. ‚ÄúWe are not reinventing the culinary wheel; exceptional seasonal ingredients, a focus on flavor, easy to understand dishes, but executed with precision and attention to detail. Just great food without pretense.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs great about the Coppersmith is how dynamic the venue is and the spectrum of offerings that we can share with guests.‚Äù Between the food trucks, a grab ‚Äòn‚Äô go focused caf√©, communal seating, plenty of ‚Äòelbow dining‚Äô space at the bar, and a soon to be rooftop raw bar‚Ä¶there are no shortages of opportunities to be creative and offer our guests value and variety. ‚ÄúWalking through the restaurant you might grab a beet salad with pistachios and verjus to-go from the caf√©, swing by the food trucks for a thin patty burger or tacos and street corn. Hit the patio for a dozen Wellfleets, park at a table inside with friends and order a round of snacks like roasted Sparrow Arc Farms carrots with whipped ricotta, or lobster fritters with pimenton aioli.  For bigger parties dive into one of our family style meals like roasted pig, a clam bake, or fried chicken dinner. And for a little sweet indulgence, try a homemade dessert like a blueberry oat tart with buttermilk glaze, or our rhubarb graham cracker shortcake‚Äù.

The Coppersmith experience is a bold celebration of the culinary diversity compelled by a desire to craft the ideal neighborhood menu. ‚ÄúOur goal is to feed the community and offer value through great food and genuine hospitality.‚Äù The menu offers bar snacks like homemade beef jerky or spiced Marcona almonds at the $6 to $8 range, appetizers like confit chicken wings with sambal and lime or grilled local asparagus with a poached farm egg and Pecorino in the $8 to $16 range, food truck offerings always under $10, and main dishes in the $18-$24 range. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day we want everything to be accessible and we want people to want to eat!‚Äù

      Southie Restaurant, Caf√©, and 3rd Space Set To Open Doors This Spring

BOSTON (March 16th, 2015) ‚Äì ideally situated on the cusp of the Seaport/Fort Point Channel district‚Äôs, and nestled between the West Broadway and St. Vincent‚Äôs communities, Coppersmith boasts echoes of an industrial past, retaining rustic and vintage characteristics of its former life as the Dahlquist Manufacturing Co., which specialized in copper fabrication. With dueling competition kitchens (exceptional for chef challenges and restaurant pop ups), a caf√© (and Boston‚Äôs most expansive 3rd space), chef-inspired grab n‚Äô go offerings, multiple patios, rooftop agriculture, and social impact programming; Coppersmith is breaking the mold in crafting a dynamically matchless neighborhood offering. 

‚ÄúThe whole concept has proudly become so much more than just another restaurant on the scene‚Äù, says co-owner and entrepreneur (Building Restoration Services Corp., Fast Track Fabrication) John Childs. ‚ÄúOur genuine intent for Coppersmith is to raise the bar in terms of what we can offer to Southie and to Boston. Whether it means providing healthier family friendly menus, or job creation for local communities, the mission is - To Make a Difference, Inspire Smiles, and Have Fun while doing it. That is how our teams are working together to define hospitality.‚Äù

Coppersmith management is designed as a SWAT team of culinary pioneers and respected industry personalities. At the core, it is supported by the professionals from Red Door Hospitality, including popular New York restaurateurs Franklin Ferguson / Leyla Marchetto, and international restaurant developer Travis ‚ÄòTbone‚Äô Talbot, complemented by a Red Door Hospitality lineup support crew of industry experts. Coppersmith‚Äôs most recent talent acquisitions include Paul Bruno from the iconic Glynn Hospitality Group, who is championed as Coppersmith‚Äôs General Manager. Spearheading culinary operations is Executive Chef Chris Henry who has excelled in prominent venues like Black Salt (Washington, D.C.), and locally with South End Buttery, 9 at Home and Drink from the Barbara Lynch Gruppo. 

In defining Coppersmith‚Äôs menu, Executive Chef Chris says, ‚ÄúOur menu can best be described as global, hand-crafted, social fare. It consists of familiar staples, as well as exciting interpretations of classic dishes with influences from all points on the map. We love the Julia Child approach of from-scratch, prepared slowly, and served simply‚Ä¶and whole-heartedly embrace the ‚Äòlocalvore‚Äô philosophy.‚Äù On the beverage side, Bruno describes a program that is original and unpretentious, featuring a deep roster of bottled micro-brews, eclectic and classic wines, diverse tap handles, and cocktails highlighting in-the-moment seasonal ingredients.

Coppersmith is on track (even with a record snow year) for the doors to swing open late April / early May. ‚ÄòHiring Now‚Äô announcements will be posted via Facebook / Twitter (coppersmithbos + @coppersmithbos) and in local community papers in upcoming weeks. In addition, open house events and applications will be announced at beginning of April.

Among some pretty good company here! ;), Some great recipes if one of your New Year's resolutions was moderation., Not saying that we are 'winos' or anything like that...but a good hack is a good hack., Interesting new trend. Has anyone tried a coffee tonic before?, For all of you hardcore foodies...a little light reading., Great meeting this morning with the team working on the finalization of the Coffee Shop/Cafe/3rd Space part of Coppersmith 1894. Some  of the great conversations were about our partnerships with Triangle Inc and working towards making all spaces 'all-accessible'., Thank you Rachel and the good folks at Eater Boston for following along and tracking our progress!

We are officially under way and looking to bring BIG things to the community and hospitality/charitable landscapes., Add Coppersmith 1894 to the list in 2015!
