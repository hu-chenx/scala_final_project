Use #ThriveChat to post your questions & comments. #blizzard2016, I propose a 21-day challenge to inspire you to thrive in 2016! No more resolutions!

-Set a start date & use your calendar to record and assess
-Did you know that writing down your actions & intentions make them more likely to actually happen?
-21 days is a proven amount of time to create new habits that will stick
-The more you can joyful integrate new healthy habits the more likely you are to keep them as part of your everyday life

Who is with me?, Hope you are having a spicy day
What are some of your faves?, This year, don't just make a resolution! Let’s create a plan to thrive together! 

-Consider your resolution a beginning rather than a goal
-Reframe your resolution, ex: instead of losing weight perhaps you are gaining health, energy & confidence
-Instead of being overwhelmed by starting a whole new exercise regime, break it down into smaller steps with a defined timeline
-Assess what you are doing now & how you can improve, not necessarily change
-Keep it positive & bring joy to the process
#ThriveIn2016, When it comes to plans to change ourselves, many times we frame our resolutions in the negative, when they should be uplifting.
For example:
-You want to LOSE weight or QUIT a habit

By using these terms, we are bringing focus to something we dislike about ourselves. Negative terminology is never a good starting point for success! #ThriveIn2016, Did you know that today is called "National Ditch your New Year Resolution Day?"

Typically only 8% of people stick to their New Year’s Resolutions each year. But what if this year, instead of setting a resolution, you take a no-excuses approach & actually create a plan to thrive all year long?

-Making a wish does not set you up for success.
-A resolution like “I will lose weight,” doesn’t provide the tools you need to achieve your goal
-Fail to plan, plan to fail

For the next few days, Thrive Naturally will be helping you create a plan that you won't quit in a matter of weeks! Check back in tomorrow for our next post. #ThriveIn2016, null, Perhaps the secret to thriving is based in ancient medicine that actually cures vs. masking symptoms.

Frank Lipman MD does a great job explaining why.

I see a lot of people who chew gum either as a way to ‘trick’ themselves to NOT eat or to freshen their breath. Most gum contains artificial sweeteners, which actually increase your appetite and the chewing stimulates the production of digestive enzymes and signals the brain that it’s time to eat—so basically, it works against you if your goal was to suppress hunger. The sugar alcohols can also cause bloating and digestive discomfort. So, if you’re hungry, have some real food and quit the gum habit once and for all., Had a great day making chia pudding with the ladies of the Lean on Me Breast Cancer Network today at their Summer Serenity event.

Spending time outside with the beauty, sounds & smells of Nature has been shown to lower blood pressure & heart rates, reduce stress hormones, boost immunity & improve overall mood. When you’re most tempted to hibernate, shift your approach with a brisk walk in the woods. Bundle up and take in the glittering, frost-filled splendor of winter. Do a quick gratitude meditation, or just breathe deeply & mindfully, observing Nature in her dormant cycle before the rebirth in spring. The more sensory your experience (shut off your phone & relish in the silence), the greater the health benefits will be.

I am thinking about what I am eating. I had meat last night for the first time (since the cleanse) - chicken as a slide dish & my veggies as my meal. So far so good. I have a sweet tooth and LOVE chocolate. So far I am making the better choices - an orange instead of a brownie, 5 almonds and 1 square of dark chocolate instead of a piece of cake. I have always enjoyed eating fruit, but they taste much sweeter now! Thank you MaryAnn!

To help create and execute long-term plans outside the office, more doctors are turning to health coaches who work closely with them (some even sit in on physicals) to develop specific regimens and goals. Using physical exams, tests, blood work, and medication orders, health coaches then keep in touch regularly to ensure patients hit those targets.", Some good news on Friday the 13th., Still shopping?

#manhasset #portwashington #roslyn #longisland #yoga #wellness #healthcoach #thrive, Thrive Rant—Below are the ingredients in a doctor recommended weight loss program:

Soy protein isolate, fructose, dextrin, cocoa (processed with alkali), whey protein concentrate, modified food starch, chicory root extract (inulin), soy lecithin, salt, cellulose gum, natural and artificial flavor, acesulfame potassium, corn syrup, xanthan gum, carrageenan, caramel color.

The client who was using these products was actually gaining weight, has "horrific" PMS & constipation. I am sure the amount of processed soy & artificial sweeteners has greatly contributed to her current health issues. She had no idea that processed ingredients could be causing her symptoms. I am hopeful that the small changes she is making with real food will remedy all & help her reach her health & weight loss goals., Email from a client

I will speaking in the morning on You Are What You Drink—how beverages can sabotage health & weight loss. Sponsored by Manhasset Women's Coalition Against Breast Cancer (MWCABC) with funds from the LI2day Walk, What would it take to motivate you out of a state of passive acceptance or active denial into engaged, life-affirming action to THRIVE?, Be Nice To Yourself! 
If you think that the key to greater willpower is being harder on yourself, you are not alone. But you are wrong. Study after study shows that self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power. In contrast, self-compassion—being supportive and kind to yourself, especially in the face of stress and failure—is associated with more motivation and better self-control. Consider, for example, a study at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, that tracked the procrastination of students over an entire semester. Lots of students put off studying for the first exam, but not every student made it a habit. Students who were harder on themselves for procrastinating on their first exam were more likely to procrastinate on later exams than students who forgave themselves. The harder they were on themselves about procrastinating the first time, the longer they procrastinated for the next exam! Forgiveness—not guilt—helped them get back on track. ~ Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D. from The Willpower Instinct

Well there’s a Big Idea, eh?!

It’s important that we hold high standards AND it’s really important that we’re nice to ourselves when we fall short. That constant self-criticism is a great way to make sure we continue doing the very things we want to change!

Remember: “Everybody makes mistakes and experiences setbacks. How we handle these setbacks matters more than the fact that they happened.”

Here’s another powerful idea to keep in mind: “We all have the tendency to believe self-doubt and self-criticism, but listening to this voice never gets us closer to our goals. Instead, try on the point of view of a mentor or good friend who believes in you, wants the best for you, and will encourage you when you feel discouraged.”, Shift your thinking—Look at healthy changes as a way to increase your capacity to experience or create what you love most about life, My daughters were positively influenced by Ashton Kutcher's speech about opportunity & what sexy really looks like. We all have a chance to influence & inspire others to dream & believe. How can you make that happen today?, Citrus essential oils are a great way to boost mood & suppress appetite! Thank you Rikki for sharing this. xoxo/m, One common problem with a Spent digestive system is that the lining of the gut (your digestive system) is damaged. The gut's lining is extremely thin, often just one cell thick. This damage can be extremely problematic because 70 to 80 percent of your immune system is found in your digestive tract. When this delicate lining is damaged or worn down by a poor diet or large food particles, bacteria and toxins that should normally stay in your gut's inner tube pass through it into the bloodstream, where the immune system must deal with them. These leaking particles tax your immune system. Thus, with a poorly functioning digestive system, you don't just get digestive symptoms, you also get an exhausted immune system. To add insult to injury, you can also get pain. An overactive immune system can lead to inflammation in the body. Your immune system creates swelling to fight hurt and unhealthy cells inside your body. This is one of the reasons why your body feels so cranky and achy when you are spent." ~ Frank Lipman, M.D. from Revive Be Well by Dr. Frank Lipman, Makes my water taste so yummy.

Move. The best way to burn off the stress hormones without having to change your thinking is to move and sweat.

Breathe. Most of us hold our breath often or breathe swallow, anxious breaths. Deep, slow, full breaths have a profound affect on resetting the stress response. Take 5 deep breaths & observe how differently you feel after.

Bathe. UltraBath is a secret weapon against stress. Add 2 cups of Epsom salt (which contains magnesium, the relaxation mineral), a half-cup of baking soda, & 10 drops of lavender oil (which lowers cortisol) to a very hot bath. Then, add one stressed human and soak for 20 minutes. 

Sleep. Lack of sleep increases stress hormones. Prioritize sleep.

Think Differently. Practice the art of noticing stress, noticing how your thinking makes you stressed., Officially registered for my first 10K race!

I recently had some blood work done during a routine GYN visit. The nurse from the doctor's office called me to inform me that a few of my numbers were "out of range" & that I should see my GP as soon as possible. She noted that my HDL was 2.2 & that this was way too low. This did not make sense to me. I told her that I believe that meant that my HDL was actually quite high which would then make my ration lower than the range indicated on the lab work. She patronizingly then explained to me that low HDL was not healthy & that I might need to make some changes to my diet & that my GP would probably suggest statin medications. I took a deep breath & asked her to send me a copy of the lab report. I received it today & my HDL is actually 104—which would of course bring my ration down under the range. So I offer this up as an example of how we all need to understand what these numbers mean, take ownership of our health & Thrive with awareness & knowledge. xoxo/m, Easter veggie week continues: Couscous with Green & White Asparagus.

DAY 20-----20 TIPS

 Prepping & Planning
1. Tune out. Put that phone on airplane mode (the cell service is off, but those apps and tunes are still accessible) and plug in the headphones to avoid responding to texts or chatting with other gym-bodies. Time saved: 3-5 minutes

2. Turn it up. Prep a workout playlist appropriate to the length and type of workout in advance to avoid messing with an iPod mid-workout. Time saved: 1 minute

3. Map it out. Learn the lay of the land to skip searching for your favorite machines and equipment (where the heck do they hide those BOSU balls again?!). New to the gym? Ask a trainer to show you around. Time saved: 3-5 minutes

4. Head in during off-hours. Not having to work-in to someone else’s sets can save precious minutes. Off-peak hours may also mean plenty of available free weights and more cardio machine options (hooray for not being squeezed between the two super-sweaters on the treadmills!). Time saved: 3-5 minutes

5. Don’t be picky. Instead of showing up to classes 10 minutes early to snag your usual spot, choose classes that are routinely less full. Or just suck it up: Show up at start time and don’t worry about where you stand (someone will probably show up late and block your “window” anyway). Time saved: 5-10 minutes

Strength Training

6. Superset. Decreasing the rest time between sets may burn more calories and work muscles smarter— not to mention shave off precious seconds[1][2]. And at 3 sets of 7 exercises, those 30 seconds saved per set really add up. (Go hard or go home, right?) Time saved: 10 minutes

7. Join a class. It’s like having a personal trainer— but with 25 of your closest pals. With their definite start and end times, full-body focus, and central stash of gear, organized strength training sessions may be just the ticket for a quicker workout. Time saved: 5-10 minutes

8. Keep it moving. When moving from one weight rack to another, try lunges or bicep curls instead of doing them as a separate set later (just be sure to return everything to its rightful home at the end). Time saved: 30 seconds

9. Gotta Tabata. High-intensity interval training, like Tabata, can trim a workout down to as little as 4 minutes. Give it a shot, but go easy at first to avoid collapsing into a hot, sweaty ball of emotion on the floor (never a good look). Time saved: 15-30 minutes

10. Go full-body. Make the most of lifting time: Choose compound lifts (like deadlifts and lunges) over isolation exercises to work multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Time saved: 15-20 minutes

Cardio

11. Run intervals. Slow and steady doesn’t always win the race. Instead of running at a steady pace, try interval training, which alternates bursts of high and low intensity cardio. Time saved: 10-20 minutes

12. Go solo. Or work out with a pal who doesn’t mind a silent run. When aiming to get in, get out, and get on with life, a higher intensity workout is a must. And being able to chat means that goal isn’t being met (it’s called the “talk test”). Time saved: 5 minutes

13. Avoid distractions. Know what will get in the way of an effective workout before hopping on the treadmill. So if reading a book or watching TV interferes with keeping pace, nix it. Time saved: 5 minutes

In the Locker Room

14. Walk it out. While heading out to the gym floor, rotate the arms front, back, and across the chest to kick-start a warm-up— just don’t forget to stretch out the rest of those muscles before getting started! Time saved: 1 minute

15. Shower stretch. Try post-workout stretches in the shower (to avoid slipping, it might be a good idea to limit it to the upper body) or locker room while prepping to leave. (Just make sure no one’s looking… awkward!) Time saved: 3 minutes

16. Don’t change out. Work out before or after work instead of mid-day and just wear gym clothes on the way in or out (one less changing sesh!). Time saved: 3-5 minutes

17. Take a quickie. Shower, that is. Stick hair in a shower cap and use dry shampoo (if necessary) after toweling off. No need to dry and style! Time saved: 5-20 minutes

18. Skip the sink. Instead of scrubbing away at the sink (and washing away a face of makeup, ladies), use a pre-moistened face cloth to wipe away sweat and grime. This will also leave eye makeup intact— just reapply what’s needed. Time saved: 1-4 minutes

19. Stay organized. Instead of dumping gym gear into a bag, keep things organized to save precious time wrangling toiletries and unknotting headphones. Time saved: 1-2 minutes

20. Don’t clean up after yourself. Wiping down equipment is for losers! Just kidding— always be courteous to other gym-goers, even if it takes a few minutes., Thrive for through the holidays DAY 19: SELF REFLECTION: As the new year approaches I hear from people what they want for the upcoming year. I hear over and over " I wanna be like so and so and that actress etcetc. Be careful who you idiolize-most people who seem to be "all that and a bag of chips" suffer somewhere in their lives on some level that the public never gets to see. The grass is always greener is never truer than when it comes to body image. 2013 worry about YOU!. Be a better YOU and stop comapring yourself to other people. We are all different-some better than others and some worse. I'm not saying you can't look at some Facebook model and use that for inspiration (hell I do), just don't expect to become THAT person. Understand that using them as inspiration is what you will do to achieve YOUR goals. YOU ROCK! PS  In case your off track  - it's 100 squats today xoxo-mike, THRIVE through the holidays DAY 18

8 Reasons Why We Fall Off The Workout Wagon During The Holidays

 
Reason #1: You have a perceived lack of time

This is probably the most common complaint. You have your career, a girlfriend or wife and possibly kids to attend to, not to mention your buddies who are always tempting you to go over and watch the game. Life's demands just don't stop, and often, they crowd out your gym time.

What you can do:
Schedule your workout time. Start scheduling your workout time into your day just like you would a doctor's appointment. Once it's written, view it as a commitment, something you will have to schedule other things around.

Maximize your workout time. The second thing you can do is make sure you are making the most out of your workouts at the gym. Instead of doing a whole bunch of exercises that isolate one muscle, such as tricep kickbacks, do compound exercises that will work many muscles all at once (e.g. chest press).

Consider supersets. You can either alternate between agonist and antagonist muscle groups like biceps and triceps, or between upper and lower body exercises. This way, you can work one muscle group while the other is resting and cut that "dead" time out of your workout.

Schedule shorter sessions. If you only have 30 minutes, you can still get a great workout, so long as you push yourself hard. You don't really need to dedicate an hour or more to see results. Many times, people in the gym are actually overtraining, and cutting down your workout time might actually provide you with better results.

Have easy access to your gym. Finally, when choosing a gym, make sure it's easily accessible. Find one on the way to or from work and you will be much more likely to make a stop.

Reason #2: You don't see results

You've been working out for three months and have yet to see results. This makes you question why you even bother and sends your motivation out the window. If this is the case, it's time to re-evaluate your workout routine.

What you can do:
Hire a personal trainer or nutritionist. Enlist the help of a professional  who might be able to quickly pick up exactly what to change to achieve your desired results.

Set realistic goals. If you started working out a month ago weighing 200 pounds with 25% body fat, you won't be able to get down to a cut, 10% body fat frame in a few weeks. If your goal is a large one, break it down into smaller mini-goals so that you are continuously making small achievements.

Eat healthy. Finally, have a look at your diet; if you are grabbing a handful of nuts while watching the game or have been knocking back an extra beer after work lately, these will all add up and slow your progress. When your diet is on track, your efforts in the gym will be much more noticeable.

 
Reason #3: You injured yourself
If you've suffered an injury recently, this will no doubt be a setback for you. But don't become depressed about it and completely avoid the gym.

What you can do:
Shift the focus of your workouts. Take the time to focus on other aspects of your workout that you have been neglecting. If you've been really hammering the weights hard, try emphasizing your cardio training a little more.

Emphasize other body parts. If you injured a smaller body part, such as your shoulder, you can still perform strength exercises for your legs. Just make sure you allow yourself enough time to recover and seek professional treatment if need be, otherwise you will only increase the amount of time you are sidelined.

Reason #4: You go to the gym, but don't get enough done
This may be the case if you socialize at the gym. Your rest periods turn into rest sessions and a trip to the water fountain usually involves a detour to chat with the girl on the bike. If this sounds like you, it's time to focus on why you're there.

What you can do:
Set an amount of time to train. Try to perform your entire workout within a set period of time. Once you get it out of the way, take a few minutes to socialize and relax. 

 
Reason #5: You are self-conscious or intimidated
If it's been a while since you last worked out, you may feel slightly embarrassed by your current shape when you're in the gym amongst all the other guys who seem like they've been there for years.

Or, if you're a newbie and don't understand many of the basic concepts, you might feel intimidated by all the different equipment and machines.

What you can do:
Talk to a personal trainer. Make an appointment with a personal trainer who will show you all the basics and get you started on a program you feel comfortable with.

Train during slow times. If your appearance makes you feel uneasy, head to the gym at non-peak hours so there will be fewer people around. It would also help to remind yourself that it's a matter of time before you see improvements.

Train with a buddy. Find a friend who's also interested in getting in shape. Your workouts will be more enjoyable and you'll have a spotter.


Reason #6: You don't like your gym
If you got your gym membership years ago, various factors might have changed. If it's the gym that's keeping you out of the gym, then it's time to look at taking out a new membership.

What you can do:
Get a membership at a new gym. When looking for a new gym, take advantage of many of the free offers out there allowing you to be a "member" for a week before making a commitment to ensure you like it. Also, make sure you read up on all their policies and guidelines before signing any sort of contract.

Subscribe to a large chain of gyms. Become a member of a larger chain that allows you to train at any location in your city and drop in as a guest when you travel. 

Reason #7: No one supports your efforts
Your better half may be angry that you're cutting into the time he/she gets to spend with you by going to the gym, and your friends may become slightly resentful of your rapidly-improving body and the fact that you're making them look bad.

What you can do:
Invite them to train with you. Invite your significant other to the gym and try to pique their interest in fitness. If their not the fitness type, then make it clear that you are working out to feel better about yourself. 

If your buddies are the problem, invite them as well. Otherwise, you may want to avoid mentioning your workouts around them. 

Reason #8: You don't like going anymore
If you are just finding it hard to go, for no particular reason, you may just need a break. Everyone experiences a bit of a burnout or a psychological barrier from time to time.

What you can do:
Visualize the results. Envision the results you hope to see as a way of motivating yourself to go again.

Update your routine. Change your workout routine. Try some new exercises or maybe even a whole new form of workout such as boot camp or a kickboxing class. Often, a change of pace is enough to get you going again.

Reward yourself. Buy yourself something you really want after a given amount of successful sessions. Set a goal you can work toward.
training hard... or hardly training?
Try not to stress too much if you find yourself losing interest in working out. There are so many reasons why this could be happening and most men will experience one or the other at some point in their lives.

Just stop and take a good look at what underlying factors are pushing you away and come up with a way that works for you to beat these factors out and re-motivate yourself to continue on your path to better health and a better body., DAY #17: 2013 GOALS: Start thinking big for 2013, plan big, reach for the stars....we are!, Thrive Through the Holidays DAY 17: Stop Wishing & Start Thriving. You are capable of making positive changes any time you choose. If you continue to think that now is not a good time, well, then it isn't. Change your mind & change your life., Thrive Though the Holidays DAY 16: QUITTERS! We are all guilty of starting and stopping a workout program. It's especially easy to slack off during the holidays-remember the amount of weeks you skip exercising it can take upto 2x that to regain what you lost (i.e. take 2 weeks off it'll take 4 to get that level of fitness back that you had before you stopped.) So, its it worth it to stop and start? You tell me.......it's always better to keep THRIVING!, Thrive Though the Holidays DAY 16: EGGS! Nutrish + Delish, eggs pack protein & nutrients to help you thrive. Keep some frozen spinach & goat cheese on hand & you have a meal in 5 minutes.

Spread the Thrive message-very few shirts are left and make a great holiday gift! Message us if your interested. Thanks to Carrie N Mike Hawkins for modeling and supporting Thrive Naturally xo, Thrive Through the Holidays DAY 13. IMMUNITY BOOSTING "Super Immunity" is a great, easy to follow book that literally spells out how to use everyday foods to keep your body strong against cold, flu AND disease. (greens, onions, mushrooms, berries, beans & seeds/nuts), Thrive through the holidays DAY 13: PERSISTENCE!  Changing your body takes time but with the right plan and determination it will happen. Individuals vary in the rate at which they gain and lose muscle. Genetics, gender, age, physical condition, training program, and diet all have an effect. Under the best circumstances, the average male can build about .5 to 3 pounds of muscle per month and a woman will gain less. The rate of muscle breakdown also varies depending on diet, activity level, fitness level, and whether an acute illness is involved. In a state of complete inactivity, a significant amount of muscle is lost in the first three days, but it slows down after that. The answer is to just do the best YOU can and let mother nature do the rest-good luck!, Thrive for the holidays DAY 12: LEARN from our mistakes!

Let's make a list of all the real excuses you use during the holidays to not workout.

1. You burn calories even at rest. Muscles, unlike fat, are metabolically active, and so you burn weight even at rest. Yes, you might be able to sweat hard during a 30-minute cardio session, but by pumping iron you get the added benefit of losing weight with little effort. It's like your body is transformed into a fat busting machine that is in action 24/7.

2. You reduce risk of osteoporosis. Women are far more susceptible to developing osteoporosis which results from the lowering of bone density. Resistance or strength training is a woman's best defence to counteract this issue, which leads to brittle bones. Bone mass generally starts to decline after age 40, but strength training will help to keep bones stronger even through menopause.

3. You will become stronger and more defined. Despite popular belief, women don't generally bulk up by lifting weights because of their low testosterone levels. You also get the added benefit of defining your figure by toning your arms and you glutes and lifting your butt.

4. It lowers risk of heart disease. Your risk of heart disease is lowered when your body is lean. That's because resistance training helps to stabilise blood pressure levels and helps you lose visceral fat which is the most dangerous type of fat when it comes to cardiovascular health.

5. You will feel empowered. Being able to pump iron that weighs almost the same amount as yourself will help to give you an ego boost like nothing else, especially if you are the one the males at your gym look to for tips on weight lifting.

6. Your clothes will fit better. One pound of fat takes up 18 per cent more space than one pound of muscle. So as someone who is muscular, you would be able to fit into your clothes much better than someone who weighs probably less than you, but has a lot of body fat., True....so true!, Stay strong thrivenation!, THRIVE hopes everyone is fairing well from the storm and is safe and sound tonight.

Stretch, see athletes are smart!, My favorite couple THRIVE'ng together!, The many sides of the new THRIVE shirt!, I've always thought that if I waited for conditions to be perfect...days where I am not busy...times when nothing hurts...I may only workout a couple of days a week at best! We will always be busy or have aches and pains. We will have days that we don't feel as mentally strong as we'd like or where we simply don't feel like getting up and going to the gym. It's normal. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be normal...average...like anybody else. Don't you feel the same? I want to be extraordinary in my own way, and for that to happen...we have to get up when we don't want to. We have to keep going when it hurts. We have to MAKE TIME to workout. Make choices today that will lead you towards being extraordinary! Consistency that's the  magic pill.

Thank you Mike for your inspiration. I know you inspire me to push myself. It is so easy to make the same choices we always make, but, surrounding yourself with people who encourage you is vital for success. xoxo/mj, RANT ALERT: I do not post this picture in vanity ( believe it or not) I post it because this is the leanest I have been in 20 years. People expect things of me physically 'cause I'm a trainer, but the reality is its just as hard for me day in and day out to diet right and workout hard. It just isn't given to me,I bust my ass for it. So with that said- I am the leanest I have been in years because I have been marathon training for over 5 months! I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone ( waaaay out) and I challenge you to do the same. Stop complaining you don't look like fitness models if you don't put the work in that they do... just because you do cardio 5x per week and lift weights 3x per week and eat really well doesn't mean you get to have that body you always wanted. You must push and push yourself out of that comfort zone to achieve those kind of results, period...that simple. So ask yourself after your next run/bike/ lifting session " did I push myself out of my comfort zone?" If you didn't that's OK as long as your OK with average results - so what's it gonna be? - mike, The route of death lol, Technically 21.5 miles / 11 min/mile avrg ( stopped the watch by mistake for .5mile)...emotionally and physically drained but happy I THRIVED for the last time before the big race .

I run because Mike runs and that got me started. It all started with Mike and made it's way to a 12 year old girl who is soooo proud of herself!!! Never underestimate how far your influence can go!" ...

SO EVERYONE OUT THERE LISTEN UP- YOUR ACTIONS CAN BE MOTIVATING SOMEONE ELSE RIGHT NOW AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF YOUR ACTIONS!-mike, Health Coach art. Keep beautiful foods displayed in your kitchen to inspire you to Thrive., This " unedited rant" is for a new client of mine who sent me pictures of supermodels..............I feel bad for my female clients, I really do. The world you women live in that distorts what is sexy and strong can't be easy to live with every day. The odd thing is that you have to realize that EVERYONE has something that's not "acceptable" on them. Supermodels have cellulite, bad breath, have gas, bad skin (makeup and lighting makeup and lighting), they take drugs, they don't eat for days, they workout obsessively, they can't hold a relationship for more than a month, they can't manage money, their feet smell and on and on and on. I think its ok to use those girls in magazines (and even some I post from time to time) as motivation-that's ok BUT remember YOU CAN ONLY BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE- you can't get taller, shorter, bigger bones, smaller bones, (i guess you can change your hair color and length so I'll skip that one) etc etc. Just keep working hard to be your REALISTIC YOU. Working out and eating right is not and never will be a guarantee for the perfect human being. It will never give you back that perceived effort your putting in. If you are someone that goes to the gym work hard (or at least thinks they work hard) and then can't lose the weight or tone your arms that's because this is a lifestyle, a lifelong effort. The day to day workouts add up they don't deliver a 1:1 reward. You workout you lose weight the next day-doesn't happen that way. As soon as you forget that and just workout for the feeling you get and your overall health the body change will come-I promise. So for now let those models motivate you but don't compare. Just use YOU as your best benchmark for improvement.. Here's the letter I got and to that person never forget where you came from!

Mike,  .I know im not the same as them...But this is what i look at everydayThese women work so hard and look amazing...i tell myself dont give up one day ull get there...its my life goal to get there and keep going...Just so u know what goes through my head everyday i see myself in the mirror...i dont see weakness, i dont see uglyI see flaws, jigglies (hate it so much), stretch marks, scars & fatSome will go away and it will cause im thriving and pushing everyday to get there and those things that are there forever...reminds me of the battles i have overcome and gone thru...remind me of those that stand by, believe in me when noone else did...and especially that one person (aka You)

Met with a client today who recently left her doctor's office with prescriptions to "manage" her type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure & high cholesterol. What she did NOT receive was one shred of information about any of her conditions, not one referral, resource or word of encouragement. She has been "managing" by merely following the directions on her RX labels. She didn't know what a glucose monitor was, how to get one, how to use one or what the numbers meant. She didn't know how much sodium is in deli ham or that potassium is the un-salt. She didn't know there was hydrogenated oils in her "doctor recommended" Centrum Vitamins.

I know there are great doctors out there doing amazing work, FIND ONE!!!!

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?
What if, what if, if today was your last day?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are

So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?

> Thrive without complaining. If you truly want something, you find a way to get it. If you have an obstacle in front of you, you will either find a way to get through it, or find a way around it!

> Thrive through priorities. Find time for what you think is important. Manage your schedule.

> Thrive with real food all the time. If you can't find it, bring it. You take the time to prepare your food, because you are aware how bad food choices reflect your health & performance!

> Thrive by always giving your best. You strive to move past "fine" to "amazing".

> Thrive by eating mindfully. Enjoy your food by preparing it with care & eating with intention.

 > Thrive with water. You know how much more energy you have without the liquid, sweetened, caffeinated beverages.

> Thrive with support. You can excel when you
have somebody to teach you what you don't
know; inspired you to reach your goals; and hold you accountable for your actions. xoxo/m, A group of clients were recently asking if there was plate that would remind them to keep their portions in check.

Diet soda, low-calorie desserts, & low-carb frozen lasagna offer little satisfying substance & lots of processed, genetically modified, hydrogenated, sugar coated or worse artificially sweetened chemicals. This is not how we Thrive. It's a model for a big business & profits.

2. It's Not About Quantity. It's About Quality.
Processed food is highly addictive. The more salt, fat & sugar added to your meal, the more of it you'll eat. Food companies know this & count on it to help boost their sales. Most of the foods recommended by mainstream diet companies are really nothing more than low-nutrient, flavor filled food-like substances that make you fat, sick & lethargic. You can not overeat real food!
