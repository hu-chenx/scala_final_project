Q. Where do you love to eat off the beaten track?
A. My latest go-to place, that I go to once a week, is Gourmet Dumpling House. The best dumplings in Chinatown. For soup dumplings, vegetarian dumplings, and their Sandong Pan Fried Dumplings, which are Taiwanese style. They are handmade to order, so it takes 15 minutes and they are just freaking delicious. The pièce de résistance is a Schezuan fish soup that is the spiciest fish soup that you’ll ever eat in your life. It will blow your head off, but it’s delicious.

As always, Our new restaurant in Cambridge will continually offer our customers the Best Authentic Chinese cuisine, Thanks for your patience and support all the time. Grand opening is Coming soon!, null, null)
