Focused on East Coast Revival, Loyal Nine is home grown talent and 100% owner-operated. Hand Craft is truly at the core of our movement. We believe something that carries the mark of the hands that made it is of greatest value. The wine list celebrates the true vigneron while Chef/Owner Marc Sheehan engages our regional farmers and artisans. Plates and mugs made by one of our owners, house ferments and a true connection to sourcing have us set to create a vibrant, personality-driven environment.

We are calling out for spirited individuals and dedicated restaurant professionals willing to learn but also collaborate. Those yearning to receive education, while delivering sincere and spontaneous hospitality, not contrived.

Bartender candidates should be more concerned with anticipating guest needs and making people smile than perfecting their Japanese Hard Shake. 

Server applicants should be excited for the opportunity to lead and contribute to a team that provides naturally joyful and engaging service on a nightly basis.

Potential Baristas can expect to push boundaries while tending to critical elements of traditional coffee preparations. Please bring your passion for the bean.

All inquiries will be kept confidential. Applicants that are interested in adding their touch to the fabric are encouraged to submit a cover letter and resume to loyalninecambridge@gmail.com, We are hiring all positions.
