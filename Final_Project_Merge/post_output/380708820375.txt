#behindthescenes #redjacketny, Happy Super Bowl Sunday! Who's ready for the big game? #SuperBowl50 #redjacketny, Did you know? Once the apples begin to grow we actually begin to thin them! Every season an apple tree produces too many apples, if you do not thin them the fruit will grow too small. This could cause the tree to become stressed and only produce fruit biannually! #TheMoreYouKnow #redjacketny, Getting our trees ready for the spring time takes a lot of work, next week we head out into the fields to prune the branches! This will allow more sunlight to enter the tree and more fruit will grow! #TheMoreYouKnow #tgif #redjacketny, Yup, those are a bunch of honeybees! 

In 2012, RJO installed bee boxes around our orchards. These bee boxes help attract and establish populations of native pollinators to augment the activities of traditional honeybees! #redjacketorchards, Did you know? Red Jacket uses high-tech high tunnels to grow our tree fruit, nearly two whole acres of our crops are grown in these tunnels!  We are one of the very few orchards on the east coast to grow fruit this way! #TheMoreYouKnow, By delicately managing soil fertility, RJO avoids excessive weed growth and maintains the balance of the orchard's ecosystem. RJO's fertility practices increasingly rely on natural fertility and organic-based inputs such as seaweed-based foliar materials. #TheMoreYouKnow #redjacketny, February 1st marks the first day we head back into the orchards to prepare our crops for the harvest season to come! Follow along this week to see what it takes to get a 600 acre orchard up and running after a long winter season! #redjacketny, null, Our newest juice, Joe's Clean Half & Half revolutionized the beverage industry!

In the Spring of 2009, Philip Seymour Hoffman stopped by our Abingdon Square market and bought some apples.

When he walked away from the stand he took a bite and yelled out: "this is the best apple ever!" Such a great compliment. 

Philip Seymour Hoffman's presence will be missed by so many, including all of us who enjoyed his weekly support at the market., Check it out!
