Endangered Speeches, the creative brainchild of Greek MC /singer/ composer/ arranger Mariletta Konstantara, aims to restore a meaningful message and forward direction to hip-hop music. Rooted equally in hip-hop and reggae, the Endangered Speeches sound is characterized chiefly by the unique global view brought by each of its 13 members. While Mariletta’s love for Rebetika (traditional Greek music) and Drum n’ Bass contribute toward a diverse repertoire, the cemented rhythm section, airtight horns, and four-part vocal harmonies build a sound both unbreakable and unmistakable.

Founded in 2008, it took a year until the band’s lineup solidified. Now, under the direction of the native Athenian, the group is equipped to bring their signature sound, style, and statement back to all the corners of the world that members call “home.” Endangered Speeches formed at Berklee College of Music and currently call Boston their collective home, but members hail from places as wide-ranging as Canada, Norway, Greece, India, Mexico and across United States, each with vast musical experience.

Now, with the forthcoming release of the debut album, The City is Rough, the band moves determinedly forward, poised to bring the music “home.”, Special Beer & Cheese Event at Bella Luna Restaurant & Milky Way Lounge http://conta.cc/IqVjrg, null, It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is .  . playing Trivia at 8:00 pm, with 50 cent wings from 7 to 9., Join us this Wednesday in our Movement to Stop the Injustice!!
