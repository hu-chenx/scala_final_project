I am so excited to work with you both! #617weddings #johnlophoto, "Classy, professional, knowledgeable, and FUN - my four favorite words to describe John! From the moment I booked our wedding photography with John LoConte Photographer - 617 Weddings, I knew we were in good hands and could trust him with all of our major decisions whole heartedly. We had the absolute pleasure of John capturing both our engagement session and wedding day! Both special life events were captured in the most beautiful way (perfect lighting/editing, posing, backdrops) and I received an unbelievable amount of compliments on how John unobtrusively captured “all the most beautiful moments.” To add to his allure, John’s prompt editing and turn around time (under one week both times) made the process so exciting - he gets the photos to you when you are still in the euphoria of reliving the event! But, most importantly to Paul and I, John was a friend throughout the entire process. He listened, made suggestions, and truly cared about our day. When time came for our final meeting, I literally trusted him so implicitly that I simply said, “Do your thing!” - and he did! I couldn’t be happier with the final products and with our future friendship with John! I HIGHLY recommend John and the entire 617 Weddings staff!"

Amanda & Paul, I seriously cannot thank you both enough for such an incredible review on The Knot & WeddingWire! It has been so amazing documenting your most special moments! What an amazing wedding you both had at The Commons 1854! I hope to see you both in the near future! Thank you! SO! MUCH! #617weddings #johnlophoto #fivestarreview #raisethebar, Thank you all for an AMAZING 2015! So excited to bring on 2016 as it looks to be our best year yet! Have a safe and wonderful evening!

Cannot wait to capture all of the memories! #617weddings #johnlophoto, "I booked my DJ (who was someone I knew through a friend) through 617 weddings. I mentioned to him that I did not yet have a photographer and he didn't hesitate in recommending John LoConte to us. I booked John without meeting with him first, because I trusted my DJ and I fell in love with the photos that John had online. We met with him just under a month before our wedding and I felt like I had known him for years. He made us very comfortable with our decision in choosing him as our photographer. On my wedding day, I was a little anxious and at times quite nervous, but John made sure to calm me down and remind me of how beautiful I looked and of how amazing my day was going to be. I really appreciated that. My wedding was held at Spinelli's in Lynnfield and was fall themed. He suggested taking some pictures by a tree with the most beautiful colored fall leaves and these photos are my favorites. They go perfectly with the whole theme of the wedding. All of my photos came out amazing and will make wonderful memories for years to come. I highly recommend John LoConte. He went above and beyond my expectations."

Can't wait to share some samples! #617weddings #johnlophoto, "I first met John LoConte at a wedding expo and was immediately in love with his work. I went home and told so many people about him, but thought he was going to be a little out of my league. When I picked my DJ (from 617 Weddings) he told me that there were a few photographers that worked within that business. After describing the style of photography I wanted he said "I have the perfect photographer in mind for your style." So I went back a week later for this meeting and I was SHOCKED to find out that it was John LoConte! IT WAS FATE!! I booked my wedding with him immediately and have been happy ever since! I can't say enough about how amazing John is. I expected the day of my wedding to be crazy and chaotic, but that was never the case. He was on time and kept everything and everyone right on track. He made sure to capture images I had in mind and then added many of his own visions, leaving us with so many breathtaking photos. I never felt rushed and we were ahead of schedule for everything we did. His personality, demeanor, and organization really set a fun and stress-free environment from beginning to end. John is truly an artist in every sense of the word. You can't go wrong!"

Working alongside 617 Weddings Filmmaker Russell Smithe! Going to be an awesome time! :) #617weddings #johnlophoto, "I can't say enough great things about John LoConte Photographer - 617 Weddings! We didn't have to think twice about hiring John from 617 Weddings for our September 2015 wedding at The Hellenic Center in Ipswich, MA. The moment I knew I wanted to hire him was when my friend got married a year before, and her wedding pictures stood out to me among the many weddings we had been to. Upon picking our date, I emailed John for his pricing and availability and he got back to me within minutes. I was so impressed with the quick response and affordable rates. Staying within an affordable budget was important to us, so we knew John was our guy. His enthusiasm and passion was evident even through email. We chose to do an engagement session and we were so happy that we did! It gave us the opportunity to work with John prior to the wedding, and his easygoing, funny personality made us relax and have a good time. When we saw John again on our wedding day, we felt even more at ease with him. He was creative, efficient, and knew exactly how we should pose and where. Most importantly, he made it fun! Our families and bridal party kept approaching us saying how great he was. We absolutely LOVED our engagement and wedding pictures and are SO HAPPY we had John photograph both occasions. I would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone!!"

"We worked with photographer John LoConte from 617 Weddings. He was AMAZING!!!!! He showed up and started shooting right away. We had spoke in detail earlier that week about what we wanted from our pictures and he took note and delivered!!!!!! He was easy going, flexible, helpful, calming and very professional. We couldn't have asked for anyone better! Things for me (the bride) were running a little behind as we were getting ready to leave to go th the ceremony site and I was worried we wouldnt have enough time for photos, but John assured me that we had plenty of time and that all was right on track. It was nice to have his calming words since I know he's shot many weddings! We would definitely recommend John and 617 weddings to anyone looking for wedding vendors. Our experience with them has been terrific from start to finish!!!!", Another amazing Groveland Fairways Bride & Groom working with 617 Weddings! Lauren & Matthew!

What makes 617 Weddings a great vendor?

Regardless of the type of service or the number of services our company provides, our goal is to ensure that each and every couple feel as though their wedding is the only wedding we have.

Let's do it! #617weddings #johnlophoto, "I first met John at a wedding show at Spinelli's and knew immediately that his work stood out to me, more than any other photographer. He had some of his work displayed and I remember thinking "Wow! I hope when my day comes, my pictures will be just as beautiful!" I didn't even need to look at anyone else, I knew right away that I wanted to book John LoConte to capture our big day. I guess you could call it instint...and I'm so glad that I went with my gut. I've only seen one picture so far that John captured from our wedding on Saturday, June 6th at the Smith Barn at Brooksby Farm, and it speaks volumes. If I hadn't already felt beyond blessed and beautiful that day, he sure made me feel it! My now husband and I have already decided we will be ordering a large canvas to place it in our home. John captured every detail and moment perfectly before our wedding even began, and continued to do so throughout the night. His talent is impeccable and I can't say enough great things about him. John is one of the most professional, friendly, courteous, and genuine people I've ever met and my husband and I are so happy that we chose him to capture our day. We'd now like to say we've gained a friend through our experience with him. His talent to capture even the finest and sentimental details is amazing & truly a work of art. We would highly recommend John to anyone & cannot wait to utilize his services for any needs in the future!"

Krystine & Michael, I can't thank you enough for this AMAZING review on WeddingWire and The Knot! So amazing working with you both!, "Choosing John to capture our wedding day was a great move! We met John when we got engaged. We decided to do an engagement shoot with him. That was where we decided we made the best choice! John is a great guy with a big heart. What made us feel good is that he is a regular guy! He made us feel like we were his friends for a long time! John captured my our love during our enagagement shoot so nicely. We then we're SO excited to have him at our wedding. During our planning John remained kind, professional and dependable at all times. On our wedding day I felt so comfortable having him there. It was like I had known him forever. His presence is barely noticed. But he somehow captures the most breath taking images possible. I would recommend JohnLo to everyone! He is simply the best!"

Here we go! #617weddings #johnlophoto, "When looking for a wedding photographer, my husband and I wanted someone who would be able to capture each element of our special day beautifully. As soon as I came across John LoConte’s work from 617 Weddings, I knew we just had to have him for our wedding at The Barn at Gibbet Hill. John was very quick to get back to me, and within just one afternoon I had gone from admiring his work online to having him booked for our wedding! All of our interactions and meetings with John were extremely professional, insightful, and fun. John asked us what our style was and what we were looking for to be captured on our special day, which he really took into consideration when shooting our ceremony and reception. John was able to beautifully capture all the elements of our ceremony, reception, guests, and surroundings, all the while remaining unobtrusive. During dinner John politely came up to my husband and I to let us know there was a gorgeous sunset going on outside and asked if we would want to take some more photos. Of course we jumped at the opportunity, and those photos ended up being some of the most beautiful from the evening. John is extremely professional, experienced, and engaged throughout the entire evening (and planning process!). We couldn’t be happier with the final photos or with our choice as John for our photographer. We also booked our DJ and videographer through 617 Weddings, which will be in a separate review, but I just can’t say enough good things about 617 Weddings and they work they do to make sure you have the best night of your life. If you’re still looking for your perfect wedding photographer, look no further than John LoConte – he will not disappoint. Thank you, John, for brilliantly capturing our moments from the most special day of our lives."

Cannot believe that our little guy turns 1 tomorrow  Birthday week has commenced!, Meeting another fantastic couple this morning!, Praying that everyone at Lakeview Pavilion in Foxboro, MA is safe. Big fire happening there right now :(, This is an amazing statement from Jimmie Espo. The owner of 617 Weddings and Move It Music DJ and Lighting. This is why I am so proud to be part of 617 Weddings. A truly amazing team of Boston's ELITE Wedding Vendors!

"Roland Silva really nails it with his comment, "I can't put into words how excited I am at what is happening at 617 Weddings. I am so excited to be part of something that is going to be so huge for the Brides, Venues and everyone in the Wedding Industry. Soon a whole new standard will be set as to how dreams come true."

That is what we are doing here, Setting a NEW STANDARD! It's no more "How much can you sell to the bride", or "Look at her venue, she has money let's charge her extra!" I am sick of the horror stories my clients are telling me about how they are being treated! Every Wedding Vendor online post I read is about how to make more money off of each event, and how to raise your prices and work less!

What happened to working harder, having a superior product and offering it at a great Value???

I am building 617 Weddings to offer a higher level of service that has been lost in the past 10 years. It's a shame what has happened to our industry and it is time for that to change. Every Bride and Groom should be able to have the BEST Wedding vendors and shouldn't have to fear being ripped off by greedy and unethical salesmen who are out to make as much as possible. Every couple should be able to relax during the planning process with the confidence that their vendors are working together, over-delivering on every promise as if this was the only Wedding they were working on!

If this sounds good to you then you have arrived, Welcome to #617weddings!! www.617weddings.com, Another awesome day @ 617 Weddings, Meeting a fantastic couple this morning alongside DJ Chuck Uglietta of Move It Music DJ and Lighting, I'd like to welcome Krystine & Michael to the family!

This review means so much to me! Now over 100 FIVE STAR REVIEWS on Wedding Wire! 102 and still going strong :)

"John shot my wedding on 5/25/2013. This review is long overdue! 

I decided to contact John because 1) I was interested in a photojournalistic style of photography 2) he had an overwhelming number of positive reviews on Wedding Wire, each stating how wonderful he was to work with and how affordable he was compared to other photographers with similar styles. He responded to my initial inquiry so quickly, and after our first meeting with him, we knew we wanted to book him! He was well prepared with plenty of albums for us to look through, asked us questions about we wanted, and was also such a nice guy! 

What amazed me on the day of the wedding was that (formal shots aside) I never even knew he was there. He was very unobtrusive, but at the same time was able to get amazing shots. We got a great mix of formals, candid shots, shots that really captured emotion, and “artsy” shots. I like them more and more every time I look at them! The turnaround on the images was super fast. We had our pictures within a couple of weeks – I couldn’t believe it! It was raining on the day of our wedding and we were pretty sure we would be unable to take outdoor photos, which was a little disappointing. Towards the end of the wedding reception, John approached us, informed us that the rain had stopped briefly, and asked us if we wanted to run outside for a few pictures. We were really impressed and appreciative that this was even on his mind. We got some beautiful shots outside at dusk that are some of my favorites! 

As we all know, weddings can get very expensive, and we had a strict budget that we could not exceed. I was afraid we would have to sacrifice quality, but I am happy to say that with John, we were able to stay within budget and still get high quality photos.", An awesome sparkler exit mixed with alcohol. Always a fun combination! Love this :), Amazing FIVE STAR review on Wedding Wire! Thank you so much Alyssa & Patrick! Now over 100 FIVE STAR reviews. Simply awesome!

"If I could give John 10 stars I would! My husband and I used him for our 6/28/13 wedding and couldn't be more thrilled. I stumbled across his site when hunting for a good but still reasonably priced photographer and couldn't be more happy that I decided to contact him. We did an initial meeting with John and we both immediately at ease, he answered all of our questions and we both left on the same page that he was absolutely the person we wanted to hire. Now, after the fact I'm still 110% sure we made the right choice. John did such an AMAZING job not only with our formals but with completely blending into the crowd and really capturing our wedding day as it truly was. He had a speedy turn around and had our pictures ready just days after we returned from our honeymoon and got our print sent to us right away. We couldn't be more thrilled with every single aspect of working with John. Thank you so much John!", Finally got around to taking pictures of my wife's ring!

"We used John for our June 15, 2013 Boxborough, MA wedding and are so happy we did. He did a great job and was sooo sooo easy to work with. He always has such a quick response and the pictures came out great. I had so many compliments from guests saying they barely saw the photographer and they were happy he was not in everyone's face as they have experienced with other photographers. My friends and family were really happy the way the pictures came out as well. 

Lets face it...a wedding day is stressful and John was so calm and really helped keep the mood light. My husband keeps talking about how he is such a cool guy and so happy I choose him. 

We got some really great pictures that some of my family took the same shots of, but John's came out wayyyy better. I am so happy we decided to go with a professional photographer and that it was JohnLo Photography! 

There were of course a couple of pics I wished we got, but there were so many others that I wouldn't even of thought of getting and I am so happy he was able to capture them. I highly recommended using John for your wedding and hope you are as happy as I am with his work.", Cannot get enough of Lorri & Scott's wedding!, Love this shot I did of The Margate on Winnipesaukee Resort during Lorri & Scott's rocking dance party!, What an amazing week this has been!

"John was great to work with. Quick responding to emails answering questions. It poured the day of the wedding and John found great indoor spaces to save the day! He captured the more formal photos as well as the great candid moments through the night that the groom and I missed saying hello to others.

This was from a wedding this past February on the day of the blizzard! I got stuck overnight at the actual wedding venue and pretty much all of the following day. My good friend Russell from Mavid Productions Videography was with me as well and he also did one hell of a job. The bride didn't miss a beat and never let the weather get in her way. We had an absolute blast :) It is fantastic to be recognized for hard work. Amie & Michael... Thank you both so much for a fantastic review!

"John was the first photographer that I was really impressed with. I kept looking cause I’m indecisive like that, but I kept going back to John’s work. What made him stand out against the dozens and dozens of photographers I looked at was his creativity, attention to detail, and distinct style. 

When we first met John we both liked him right away. I felt comfortable and knew that he would make me feel at ease on our wedding day. The best part is he is such a nice guy; so down to earth and easy-going. It’s nice to know that we were working with not just a great photographer, but a good person too. 

On the day of the wedding we got a blizzard. John still traveled over an hour without questioning us and why we weren’t just postponing the wedding. He very graciously put up with all the traveling and the driving ban the next day. We are so very appreciative of that. We realize he took more time out of his weekend for us than he typically would. 

We got our disk of pictures in about a couple weeks. They are amazing. John far exceeded our expectations. We love to show them off and brag about our awesome photographer. I recommend John as often as I can. We can’t wait to work with him again someday.", The newly renovated room at Hillview Country Club makes for great photographs!

"John! What can I say! You are absolutely amazing. From the time I first met you at my sister’s wedding, I knew I wanted to use you as my photographer at my wedding. Your enthusiastic personality and passion for photography, spills out all over your pictures. I bet there aren't many brides out there that plan their wedding date around their photographer’s availability! Thank you for providing many great laughs, and being extremely patient with Ryan and I in our not so serious moments! 

If anyone is looking for a fabulous photographer, John is it! His attention to detail is impeccable. I especially loved his “sneak preview” pictures within hours of our engagement session/wedding, and quickness in the delivery of my pictures (about 3 week’s turnaround).", Hey everyone!

So great :) Thanks so much Stephanie & Jesse! This review proves that we have packages for just about every budget. You will ALWAYS get the best quality wedding photographs we offer! It doesn't matter if you choose a small package or a larger package! We offer the best value in the area!

"Being a bride on a tighter budget than most I was very anxious about finding a high quality wedding photographer in my price range. After much searching I found John's website and knew immediately that he was the one I wanted. My husband and I couldn't be more thrilled with our photographs and to be honest John's work is equal to or superior than any of the other photographers I looked into and his packages are much more reasonable. 

From the very first email John was extremely professional and friendly and quickly put my mind at ease. He kept in touch with us in the months leading up to our wedding and called a couple of weeks out to go over the entire day start to finish. On my wedding day my bridal party and I were late arriving at our house but John didn't waste a second! He took lovely pictures of my dress, jewelry, shoes, etc until I arrived and still managed to take all of the "before" photographs of my bridal party that I wanted and had us in the limo ahead of schedule! 

John's style is really artistic and I love that I have so many natural, candid shots. He managed to capture all of the most important moments but I hardly noticed he was there! I have been to weddings before where the photographer was very intrusive but John just fades into the background all the while taking beautiful photographs. 

After receiving and sharing our photographs with friends and family the compliments just kept coming! I've had several people ask for John's name when it is their turn to plan a wedding and I feel 100% confident recommending John to anyone. 

The only problem we have encountered is choosing which photos to put into an album and which to frame because I love every single one of them! We can't thank John enough for capturing the most important day of our lives in such a beautiful way and he comes with our highest of recommendations! 

Stephanie and Jesse Finley", Another simply amazing FIVE STAR review on Wedding Wire! Ashley & Nick... Thank you both so much! :) I am thrilled that you were so happy with JohnLo Photography!

"We hired John to do our engagement photos and our wedding photos. From the start he was easy to communicate with, and met up with us in Newburyport for our engagement shoot. John is very friendly and made us feel at ease while shooting pictures of us in this public setting. Our photos came out great and he captured many natural moments of us walking, and laughing, along with more traditional portraits. We were so pleased with the photos that we couldn't wait for our wedding. John didn't disappoint. He covered the entire day and used multiple cameras to get different angles of the ceremony which came out great. We had seen some inspiring and creative shots online that we shared with John that we wanted to emulate. We didn't want to step on his toes creatively but we wanted to try some ideas. John was very receptive and put his own touch on our ideas. He captured some stunning shots of us using some very creative lighting. Many of our friends and relatives were wowed by how some of the unique photos came out. In fact, some of those photos grace his facebook cover page and he featured us as one of his portfolio galleries on his website. We were thrilled and honored by this. John was also hard at work at our reception. Although he records the big highlight moments front and center, he's not in your face or anything. In fact he sometimes blends in with guests so you almost don't know he's capturing very natural interactions of everyone having fun. 

We are so happy with our photos. We recommend John to anyone who's looking for affordable and quality wedding photos. His rates are reasonable and he gives you full rights to your photos. John is a joy to work with, he's very down to earth, and a true professional. Thank You John for helping us preserve memories for a lifetime! - Nick & Ashley Miller", So excited to be working with Elly & Ricardhy!

I feel blessed to have had you in our life. As I'm sure others feel as well. Your photo's adorn our walls and tabletops throughout our home. Love.
I am so glad that you have made a healthy business out of what you have obviously been born to do. I wish I could have met your lovely bride on the day of our wedding. She couldn't make it that day for some reason. And now you are expecting! My best to you both.
You are a special person. And my memories of you on our special day add to the grace and love that was that day.

This is the exact reason why I do what I do :) Up to 92 FIVE STAR REVIEWS on Wedding Wire! Thank you so so so much Michelle!

"We had looked at many, many photographers for our April '12 wedding. It was a part of our wedding budget that we really wanted to splurge on, as the photos are the only items left after the day is over. We wanted to go with a photographer who was creative, reliable, professional, and most of all, "got" us. We didn't want cookie cutter shots, and we didn't want someone who only knew how to do formal, stilted photos. We aren't that kind of couple, and we wanted someone who could capture the little moments throughout the day. John LoConte turned out to be that guy! We met him, loved his work, and really liked his personality. He's low key, takes his work seriously but doesn't take himself seriously. We had met with a few diva photographers, and John was the exact opposite of that. He showed up early, set up, got some great getting ready shots, and was everywhere that day but totally unobtrusive. He had sneak peek shots uploaded that night, and our entire collection of photos were online in a few weeks. It was incredibly fast and professional. John captured our day and us as a couple perfectly. He's incredibly affordable, and seriously one of the nicest guys in the business. If you book with him, you won't regret your decision. I have some of his prints hanging in our apartment, and they're a wonderful reminder of our wedding and our love as a couple. The photos are lasting memories of the day, and they are an investment. John was the person to make the investment with for us, and we were completely happy with our decision.", Two client meetings today!

Thank you so much Dawn & Stacy! http://www.yelp.com/biz/johnlo-photography-haverhill

"John photographed our wedding and we couldn't be more pleased. He was such a pleasure to work with before, during and after! People even mentioned how wonderful they thought he was during the wedding as he blended in so well and no one felt like they were "having their picture taken" constantly. John has an awesome demeanor and he was very kind to come up with a great package that worked with our lower than average budget. I wish I could give him 10 stars as he just made the day so much easier...no worries at all. Hire John,  you will not regret it."

"I hired John to photograph my wedding in September of 2011. Needless to say we were so happy we went with John. Our photos came out beautiful and I was so impressed with our album once it came in. John is a really great guy and he is willing to help anyway he can, I even asked for some referrals of other wedding vendors and he gave me a great list.", We won the 2013 Bride's Choice Awards from Wedding Wire!

"John is such a great photographer! He was the only photographer we had met with and we just had such a good feeling about him! He is very professional and takes incredible pictures! We decided to take engagement photos and our wedding photos with him. The day of our wedding I didn't even notice he was there most of the time! He is very responsive and listens to any details you may want. We were so surprised when we got back from our honeymoon because our pictures were done about a week later. I will reccomend John to anyone looking for a photographer and I cannot wait for another reason to use John again myself! :)", Wedding today at The Commons 1854 !!, Congratulations to Ashley & Nick!, Awesome wedding weekend ahead!

"Based on our research and all of the rave reviews we found online about John's photography, we chose John to shoot photos for our engagement and wedding. We were so pleased that we did so! John is so pleasant in nature, easy to talk to, has reasonable prices and has just an amazing talent. He is also unobtrusive as there were many times during the day of our wedding that I didn't even know he was there. He respected our wishes and preferences, while capturing all of the best parts of the day. John's responsiveness is also great. He always responds almost immediately after any type of email or means of contact that I've had to make with him and has always been adaptive and flexible to our needs(ie. editing a photo or tweaking one here and there). It was also great to receive our photos just over 2 weeks after the wedding! We have gotten so many compliments about our photos and are so grateful that we decided to choose John as our wedding photographer... and would highly recommend him to any other future bride/grooms out there!"

"John came recommended to us through friends of ours that used him for their wedding. The pictures were amazing, so we went with their recommendation. We are so glad we did. John was SO easy to work with. He was VERY responsive and flexible. He listened to us and really wanted to capture the style that we were looking for. We provided him with a list of all the pictures we wanted beforehand and it really sped up the process after the ceremony. He is quick, but very efficient and the quality of the pictures is amazing. We had the pictures back before we even got back from our honeymoon. He sent us an email about 1.5 weeks after the wedding with the link to view all our photos. I've never heard of such quick turn-around time with such quality photos. I would definitely recommend using him as a photographer.", Congratulations to Kristen & Thomas for reserving their May 2013 wedding date in Sandown, NH with JohnLo Photography!, Julie & Bobby!

Up to 85 Five Star Reviews on Wedding Wire alone!

After much research, I found John through a recommendation on Weddingbee. We absolutely have no regrets having John as our photographer. He was very professional and unobtrusive during the wedding (a big plus!). We loved that he had that photo-journalistic approach which lead to some very beautiful candid photos. The husband and I are not keen on posed photos; we can't keep to hold it for long before we end up with a photo-bomb. (Very true! lol) 

John was very quick with responding to emails and easy to communicate with. (I wished all the other vendors were like him!) And, we received our photos exactly a month after our wedding.

"To say it was a pleasure to work with John would be an understatement! We were married this August in Cambridge, but planned our wedding from New Orleans - so we actually didn't even get to meet John until the week before our wedding! His website and portfolio were so professional, beautiful, and just the photojournalistic look we were going for that we took the leap and booked him purely off his great work and thoughtful email responses. It also helped that his prices were actually affordable and we didn't have to take out a loan for great wedding photos! John was so sweet and professional and did a great job the day of our wedding - he managed to get all the shots we wanted even though trying to get our family members together for pictures was like trying to herd cats! My husband commented afterward that he loved that John wasn't in-your-face with the camera, but capturing moments without being intrusive - some of the time we forgot he was even there! We have the most beautiful photos from our wedding day and the best part is that we get to keep all the beautiful retouched photos as well as every single photo he took! Hurry up and book him before he fills up for the next wedding season!", What a fantastic wedding tonight at Oakley Country Club in Watertown, MA!

"I cannot say enough to describe how incredibly happy we are that we decided to use John for our wedding day! His work is absolutely beautiful! From the initial meeting all the way through receiving our photos, John was so kind, professional and helpful. We couldn't have asked for a better person to photograph our special day. I would highly recommend doing an engagement shoot with John as well. It was so great to get to know each other before the wedding day. John made us feel 100% comfortable during our engagement shoot and on our wedding day. We got our pictures back very quickly and they exceeded our expectations.

"John was recommended to us from the Wychmere and I am so glad we picked him. He took the time to sit down with us and go through everything we wanted. He stayed in contact with us through email, and would always email us back the same day. He made us feel like we were his number one priority. On our wedding day he captured amazing photos. I didn't even notice he was there. I never felt like I was being attacked by the papparazi. Our photos were posted on the website within two weeks and they look amazing. He captured beautiful moments of both the ceremony and reception. John has a great personality and his photography style is exactly what we were looking for. He has a variety of wedding packages and all are very reasonbly priced. I highly recommend JohnLo Photography!", Fantastic client meeting tonight! :), Another great shot from tonight!

"John was so amazing to work with! Our pictures were done and perfect within 30 days of our wedding and we received our disk in the mail with rights to our pictures, also within 30 days! This service was unheard of when I was speaking with other photo vendors (most were 6 months to a year). This is one of the main reasons I chose John (I believe his contract states 60 days, but I was super impressed to receive them 30 days early)! John is so nice, and just so great to work with. He was super attentive to me and the bridal party on the day of the wedding, it completely put me at ease. His packages are so reasonable and worth every penny (if not more)! It was so nice to work with someone that was a normal, everyday person. He talked sports with my husband during our engagement shoot which helped put my husband at ease and was not over forceful with posed pictures, which I really appreciated! He got every shot I requested and so much more! I would hire him again and would recommend him and his work to anyone!", Great engagement session tonight in Boston! Only two weeks until the big day!

Kelly & Alex I cannot wait for your wedding! :), Worcester here I come! Engagement shoot time :), Truly blessed to have 80! Five Star reviews on Wedding Wire. Here is #80:

"I truly can not say enough about JohnLo. His packages are incredibly reasonable in price and the quality of his work is outstanding. In addition to this, John is a true pleasure to work with. He is full of knowledge, extremely helpful and at the same time he is fun and down to earth. 
My husband does NOT like to take pictures and I think JohnLo is one of the only people that could have successfully gotten him to enjoy the process of formal shots. During our ceremony and reception, I didn't even notice John was there most of the time. Other than the formals, he didn’t set me or my guests up for poses which left us able to just enjoy the day! We got our pictures back VERY quickly and they exceeded my exceptions. They are truly beautiful! John and I have continued to email to discuss logistics of ordering pictures and making an album. He is always quick to respond and beyond helpful! I will be recommend JohnLo to EVERYONE I know. I couldn’t be happier!", Just a GORGEOUS day at Granite Links for Francesca & David!, Great wedding at Granite Links!

"Cannot say enough about John! Not only does he offer an incredible value but his photographs are stunning. I can't believe he made us look so photogenic! He was so easy going and was very comfortable to be with on the wedding day. He was aware of where he needed to be and when and I didn't have to worry about making sure he was there to catch "the perfect shot". His pictures were artistically styled without being too much. He was very prompt in getting our proofs to us, about 3 weeks in the middle of wedding season. He was also very prompt with his responses which was a lifesaver because we were planning a NH wedding while living in Philadelphia. John absolutely captured the magic of the day and we can't thank him enough!", Congratulations to Bethaney & Adam for reserving their September 2013 wedding at the beautiful Regatta Place right on the water in Newport, RI with JohnLo Photography!, BLOG UPDATE!

John was an absolute pleasure to work with from my very first email to him asking about his availability. He was always responded to my emails right away and was so easy to work with! He photographed my friends wedding a few years ago and we are both so so happy with him and our photographs. John is also one of the nicest guys out there - he made us all very comfortable while taking photos and he was always professional. He is very passionate about his work and it shows! We woke up the morning after our wedding and he had already posted some of his favorite photos from the wedding online - it was so great to see them the next day! He also had retouched photos online in less than a month and we received all of our photos about a month after the wedding! We really believe that the photographer is one of the most important vendors you'll hire - they will be with you all day so you need to find someone you click with and someone who is going to give you great service and great photos. John is exactly this! He really is such a great photographer and person and we highly recommend him!, Just a beautiful wedding at Atkinson Resort & Country Club yesterday!, Methuen Music Hall = Amazing.

I picked John because a good friend recommended him. He was great to work with. I didn't need him for as long as his standard packages ran for, and he was very flexible with me in changing the packages. I met with him ahead of time and let him know what I wanted. He was very flexible the day of as I changed a lot of the groupings around. He really took the time to get good shots. What was important to me was that I didn't feel like I was being harassed by the paparazzi during the dancing at the reception. John was present and taking pictures, but I never felt like he was getting in peoples way. He was always near by when I decided I wanted to pose a group shot randomly. He also gives you the rights to all the photos, which many photographers don't. His fee was a little more than I wanted to spend, but he was worth it, The Taj roof deck offers such an amazing view of Boston!, Gorgeous wedding at the Taj in Boston tonight!, Wedding at the Taj Boston today!

John was absolutely amazing! We have worked with him before, and we are so happy that we picked him to Photograph Our Wedding Day! He was so prompt with getting us some teasers to hold us over until we returned from our Honeymoon! He had our pictures up on his website within 2.5 weeks of our Wedding, and our CD's are on there way! Our pictures are absolutely GORGEOUS so far! I believe Photography is one of the most important parts of a wedding, because those will always hold our memories, to show our kids one day! We are so lucky to have beautiful pictures that write a story about our Wedding Day! John was also very prompt with answering any questions we had, and fulfilling our requests about certain pictures that were a "must have"!

We couldn't possibly be happier with JohnLo Photography. Once the time and place was determined, he was the first vendor we hired. I looked at a lot of online portfolios and just really loved the viewpoint of John's images. He didn't disappoint. I can't decide which of hundreds of photographs to display, they are all just so fantastic. I think I'm going to have to rotate them on a monthly basis just so that I can see them all regularly. 


In addition to producing so many wonderful images of our wedding day, John was great to work with. He fit right into our day seamlessly and he had all the images ready when we returned from our honeymoon. 


Great experience, beautiful images, wonderful to work with, we couldn't be happier. We will definitely be recommending John to anyone we know, and will be using him for my sister's wedding (whenever that may be). 


Thanks John!
