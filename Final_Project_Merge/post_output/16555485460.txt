On Thursday afternoon at Philips Arena, Dominique Wilkins was immortalized in bronze and granite. He got emotional as he recounted his era of Atlanta Hawks basketball of the 1980s, a golden age when small forwards like Wilkins ran wild in an isolation-heavy NBA.

Wilkins never reached the conference finals with the Hawks in eleven-plus seasons, but he was an iconic presence in Atlanta, the city’s most charismatic sports hero since pro sports arrived to the city a few years after the passage of the Civil Right Act of 1964.

As large as ‘Nique’s presence was, he *never* appeared in a regular season game as big as the one the Hawks will play on Friday night in Atlanta against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Yeah, there were marquee matchups against Michael Jordan when the pair reigned as No. 1 and No. 2 in scoring. But Friday night’s showdown speaks to a much larger question:

Can a Hawks team that thrives not on the highlight reel of any one player compete with a Cavs team that features multiple name superstars, the likes of which Wilkins was during his heydey?

This season’s Hawks are a cinch to lock up the No. 1 seed in the East, but as winter approaches spring, there’s a stubborn skepticism everywhere from Vegas to locker rooms around the league that Atlanta has the juice to compete with the lethal version of the Cavs that’s been on display for the better part of a month.

A win for the Hawks won’t necessarily convince those skeptics, but a loss will definitely embolden them.
