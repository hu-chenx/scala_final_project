From the brewer: 
"We at CBC are never ones to shy away from a challenge, as demonstrated by this most recent offering. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride is brewed in the Grodziskie style. Grodziskie, or more commonly called Gr√§tzer, originated in Poland and is a sessional ale brewed with 100% smoked wheat malt, has firm hop bitterness, and (depending on who you talk to) is slightly sour.

Mr. Toad's Wild Ride has a thick white head and a very hazy golden color thanks to the wheat malt and 150lbs of sugar pumpkin. You'll get a soft aroma of wood smoke along with fruity notes of pineapple and orange. Smoke flavors are also mild and in balance with fruitiness. The beer is light on the palate and finished with a mild tartness and firm bitterness."

aka TRY ONE ASAP.
