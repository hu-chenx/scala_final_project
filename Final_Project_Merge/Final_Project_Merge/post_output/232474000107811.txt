This organization is another charity that offers FREE photo shoots to cancer patients.  

As many of you know, cancer has hit my family HARD. My Mom has been battling for three years, my Dad had prostate cancer last Fall, and my Father in Law had bladder & esophageal over the past two years.  Also my Memere, cousins and uncles, my Pepere Keith, and even some friends have had to fight the good fight.  Way too many to count!

I often feel so helpless.  But this is a way for me to give back.  I am so honored to be able to capture timeless memories for families battling this disease.  If you have cancer or know someone who does, please have them check out this free service.  <3

https://www.facebook.com/nicolelopezseniors, Hey, you! :) Yeah, YOU!  Do you want to win a FREE family session?

Sadly my family is plagued by the awful disease that is Alzheimer's. Every year we walk to raise money to find a cure. This year I've raised my goal to $1500 and REALLY need your help. TWO MORE of my relatives (another Aunt, and one of my Uncle's) were diagnosed with this awful disease in the past 6ish months. That means it hit my Gram, her siblings, 2 of my Aunts and an Uncle. And it's not too far off that it will start showing up in my generation because those who have a parent with this disease has a 50% chance of getting it. THAT IS A SCARY STATISTIC! If you have read the book or seen the movie, Still Alice, that is what my family goes through with this disease. Sad, sad, SAD!

WE NEED TO FIND A CURE!

Anyone who donates $50 will be entered to win a FREE family session with me. Why? Because family photos are SO IMPORTANT!! Donate $100 or more and enter to win a free family session with all final edited digital images. That's a $1649 value!!

Please consider donating. THANK YOU! <3

Phone: 508.241.0321, Yesterday I photographed 3 out of 5 of my class of 2016 senior models.  My heart is so full looking through these images. I have a true love for helping make a teen, or any woman for that matter, feel the most beautiful they ever have.  I think it's so important to capture who teens are in their senior portraits. Hence my motto #justbeYOU.  I don't include hair & makeup because I want to change these girls - I do it because I know how much it can make them feel BEAUTIFUL. And feeling good about yourself and having self-confidence is so necessary at such a fragile time in your life!  I believe that this self-confidence can help you do extraordinary things. To help you in your transition from high school to college life.  

So with that said.. thank you to all of my models, Kylie, Julia, Kayleigh, Emily, and Skyler for choosing to represent me and my business.  I am thrilled to work with all of you this year! <3

Hair & Makeup: Maryjo at MS Beauty By Design, So sorry to be asking for donations on my business page but this one is pretty important. My father in law has cancer of the esophagus and a few weeks ago had surgery to remove the tumor. He is out of work for a couple of months and is getting a measly $25 a day on short term disability. Yes, you read that right. $25 a day. So please, if you're willing and able, donate if you can. He needs and very much deserves any help you're willing to give. This is a hard working man who would never ask for a penny. But I will ask on his behalf ;)  Thank you <3 , Well I had my last senior session of the year tonight and it was nothing short of amazing!

At NLP I truly believe in a few things.  Getting the images right in camera with flattering poses, good exposure and good lighting. This takes knowledge and lots of practice!  I also believe in a high quality edit that enhances the subject's features, and brings life to the image.  

The first image below is great right out of the camera, but to me it's boring.  The final edit is what makes it pop!  I personally hand edit every image to give your photos that wow factor.

#engagementsession #nlpweddings #nicolelopezphotography #Boston #harborwalk #backofcamera, Checked in with a client today on her print order and here's what she had to say!  Music to my ears!!

"The quality is above and beyond what I ever expected and words cannot begin to express how happy I am!", Have you seen this yet?!  If not, you need to.  You're welcome. , Received this awesome review today!

"Nicole is amazing! We could not have picked a better photographer, her photos are amazing! My husband and I were not from Newport and did not know anyone in the area but we were lucky enough to find Nicole and hired her based on her work online!!! She was super flexible and drove in to meet us in Newport over a holiday weekend! Could not have had a better person create our memories!!"

Thank you so much Danielle, it was truly my honor to capture your wedding day! XO <3, null, Simply stunning gown and bride! <3 
www.nicolelopezphotography.com, They may or may not have had to take an elevator ride a few times to get this ;) 
www.nicolelopezphotography.com, So happy the rain stopped just in time for portraits on the beach!  It really was the perfect day <3 
www.nicolelopezphotography.com, Decided yesterday that I actually love photographing full day weddings!  My feet may hate me by the end of the day, but it's so great not being rushed, and it allows for so many more photo opportunities at a relaxed and easy going pace.  I highly recommend it!, Happy wedding day Liz & Dave!  Can't wait to capture your day, see you guys soon! <3

, Here's a super sneak peek from Kelly & Pete's fairy tale wedding last night!  <3 
www.nicolelopezphotography.com, Happy wedding day Kelly & Pete!!  See you guys later XO, Just wanted to let everyone know that my Mom is having major surgery tomorrow so my replies to email may be slower than normal.  Please bare with me over the next couple of weeks. Thank you!, Kelly & Mike's beautiful Cape Cod wedding is on Society Bride today!, Bride & Grooms -  What's the number one thing you would do differently on your wedding day if you had the chance to do it again?, Another amazing review today! Gosh I <3 my job and my clients!  

"I couldn't be more happy that we chose Nicole for our wedding photographer. I literally have over 1k gorgeous shots to choose from! She captured things that no one else has ever caught on camera (for instance, my husband's grandfather smiling), and split second actions that are now forever sealed in our memories and our photographs, such as my 2 year old nephew playing with my wedding dress at our ceremony. She also was able to wrangle our very large, very unruly families and friends to get us the formals we wanted. On top of that, she took the most flattering shots we've ever had. None of our insecurities are even the slightest problem looking through our pictures. The only problem I have now is trying to figure out how to fit get all our favorites on our limited wall space!", <3.
www.nicolelopezphotography.com, Kayla Salustio & Chris' engagement session is on Borrowed & Blue today! One of my all time favorite sessions <3 , Blown away by this awesome review that Kelly & Mike left last night!  Thank you so much for you kind words guys, it was such a pleasure working with you both! XO

"Cannot recommend Nicole Lopez enough!! Of all the vendors we worked with, Nicole was by far the most easy to work with and produced the most spectacular result. Nicole answered all of my crazy emails right away and always made me feel at ease. I also appreciated Nicole taking command on our wedding day in order to get the right shots. 

Before our engagement shoot, My husband and I were nervous that the whole process would be awkward and the pictures would come out looking too pose-y. But Nicole immediately made us feel comfortable and at ease. We ended up getting a great variety of great shots and were extremely pleased. Nicole's attention to detail leads her to create beautifully artistic photographs. 

On our wedding day, Nicole captured all of our special moments and so much more! We could not have been happier with the end result. Wedding photographs are such an important keepsake from your special day that you really want to have a photographer you can trust to do an excellent job. I was completely confident that Nicole had my best interest in mind and trusted that her skills would produce a fantastic result. 

I highly recommend Nicole Lopez Photography to capture moments from any special occasion. Nicole is the only vendors I would even bother to spend time writing an online recommendation for because I believe so much in her work. We will definitely be calling Nicole again when we start a family and need someone we trust to capture those special family moments. Cannot say enough wonderful things about Nicole's photography skills and personal character. 

Kelly and Michael Hannon"

Here at NLP we offer a one-of-a-kind senior experience that you won't find anywhere else. Our seniors are pampered from start to finish!

Here's what one Mom had to say " You have done something for her that no one has been able to do for her before. She now has confidence about how she looks."

We take your senior session to heart - it is our goal to make our seniors feel the best they have ever felt about themselves.

These are likely the last professional images you're going to get until they someday get married.. shouldn't they get the ultimate experience?!

<3 <3 <3, Gift certificates available in all denominations! Message me if interested!, Wedding Consultation this afternoon :), Came across this wonderful blog post today that was shared by another photographer.  I wanted to share with all of you as the holiday season is upon us, and many inquiries are rolling in for family photos. Myself and my peers hear repeatedly that we're too expensive, and that they can get photos done for $25 at Target,etc.  We understand that custom photography is a luxury, not a necessity, and that everyone has their own budgets to adhere to.  But I think it's also important for the consumer to have the knowledge about what goes into custom photography and all that is behind the cost. It's much more than just a digital file.  Enjoy the read! xoxo http://blog.hayleyjuliet.com/2012/11/27/the-truth/, tehehee!, So if YOU won $550 Million tonight.. what would YOU do?!, Nothing better than a fun, playful family :), seriously could have shot these two love birds all afternoon!  <3, And look at their little cutie!

Can't wait to see how much he has grown :), As I sit here and type this, I have tears streaming down my face.  I had a session scheduled for today for a beautiful woman and her family.  This beautiful woman, wife, mother of two - has cancer. The cancer is taking a toll on her, and instead of capturing beautiful memories this afternoon, she's back in the hospital. My heart is aching. 

I HATE CANCER.  I hate that so many beautiful people spend so much time being sick, and sad, and dreading the day they leave their children. The thought of leaving my two boys is gut-wrenching, and I can only imagine how those who are faced with this head on must feel.  I have lost loved ones to cancer, my friends have lost loved ones - it never gets easier.   

My prayers go out to you, you know who you are.  I pray for your strength, and God's hand to help you get well and fight this evil thing that is cancer. Please friends, keep this woman and her family in your prayers.  <3 <3 <3 <3, Photographer friends - help spread the word about The Gold Hope Project!, Do you know a family with a child battling cancer?
