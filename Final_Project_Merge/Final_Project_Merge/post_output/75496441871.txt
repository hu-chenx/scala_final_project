I think he would have liked it., 今日のランチは#牛丼 。, Feeling so super #Japanese . I love this. Having my mom's this year's  #umeboshi , the salty sour intense floral goodness that every bite seems like some sort of a punishment that you can't help but get addicted to. Then I have deliciously stinky, slimy, bitter sweet natto on rice. Of course miso soup with dashi, aka dried ocean goods steeped in water. And last but not least, tukudani with powerful mushroom flavor made with kelp and shiitake after they were used for dashi. This #lunch is not for everybody., It's wonky like me., I woke up this morning and cracked an #egg open... And found this perfect little bite of rice with tare soaked egg yolk. #frozen egg yolk, oh creamy you. It's an easy way to make the onsen egg yolk texture. (Yes, I washed the eggshells.), It's cold.

Yes, I love Hakata ramen!!!!! And !!!!!ing. But there is none where I live...! Ippudo is in NYC and can't always go in. Hide chan is in NYC, too... Hummmmm... I should move to NYC!!!! Nooool....! That's a crazy talk. 

Soooo, I decided to try making my own... And share my passion for my hometown noodle. I have so much learning to do but I can promise I make my bowl of noodle with love and passion. I'm trying to bring bit of my childhood home to where I live, home I chose. 

I hope someday, I can say I am home, Fukuoka, while having my noodle and I hope you will take the little trip with me.
