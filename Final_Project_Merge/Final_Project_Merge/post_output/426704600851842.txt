The Dungeness is waiting üî•, Spring doesn‚Äôt truly begin for the residents of Louisiana until the spicy smell of boiling crawfish wafts through the community to ring in the festivities.  Coincidentally, our bipolar New England weather decided to warm up just as Shaking Crab is opening the season by spreading the alluring smell of live crawfish throughout the streets of Newton.

Typically beginning in mid-January, the mild winter in the gulf has gifted us an earlier peak to the crawfish season, as well as some of the plumpest and most flavorful crawfish we have ever tasted!  These freshwater crustaceans are shipped live from Louisiana and boast a healthy r√©sum√© with high-quality protein, plenty of vitamins and low in fat.  

Whether you call ‚Äòem crawfish, crawdads, crayfish, or just baby-lobsters, come #shake with us before the crawfish season draws to a close in July!, How spicy do you like your shrimp with Shakin' Sauce?, Hello Shakers! 

Crawfish season has arrived and we are ringing it in with a live crawfish boil all weekend!  Enjoy juicier heads and softer tails distinct to live crawfish while supply lasts!  

Bring the whole crew and ask about our multi-pound special to share and save. Don't forget to party with our rum-soaked Swedish Fish in our Fisherman's Punch Bowl and embrace the community experience at Shaking Crab that you've all had a part in cultivating.
