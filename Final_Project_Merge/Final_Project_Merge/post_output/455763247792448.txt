http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qZvjGsPpL0, we're brunch, we're brunch...we're in your head!, ‚ÄúCenturies ago, sailors on long voyages used to leave a pair of pigs on every deserted island. Or they'd leave a pair of goats. Either way, on any future visit, the island would be a source of meat. These islands, they were pristine. These were home to breeds of birds with no natural predators. Breeds of birds that lived nowhere else on earth. The plants there, without enemies they evolved without thorns or poisons. Without predators and enemies, these islands, they were paradise. The sailors, the next time they visited these islands, the only things still there would be herds of goats or pigs. ....

Let us hope that we have won against the Franklin Cafe in the first round of Munch Madness.  We are within 300 votes of each other.  If we do not win, we will not be sad. For the Franklin Cafe is an institution in Boston with three locations and we are but one brand new restaurant.  We hope that tomorrow we can encourage you to vote for us in round two.

With consideration,
The Salty Pig, Hey Pig Fans ! Get on down to this link and vote for ALL of these great restaurants but most importantly vote for us. We are up against the excellent Franklin Cafe (boo! hiss!) and as a low seed a big upset would be nice! 

Vote often! Vote Early! Vote Salty!
