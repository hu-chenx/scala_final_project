We will proudly feature Extraomnes Zest.
Birrificio Extraomnes was recognized for remarkable consistency and excellent quality by the Slow Food Guide 2015 “Guida alla Birre D’Italia 2015”.
Head brewer Luigi “Schigi” d’Amelio is a well-known sommelier in Italy. His brewing philosophy is to make beers that he likes, but with the deepest respect for the history and traditions of the great brewing regions and their beer styles. After just three years of making excellent craft Italian beer, “Schigi” was appointed 2013 Brewer of the Year (“BIRRAIO DELL’ANNO 2013") by Associazione Culturale UNIONBIRRAI.
