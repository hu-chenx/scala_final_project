Repost from @jjamison1973 - While practicing lighting for an upcoming food shoot I decided to grab some vegetables from the fridge. This is obviously not my normal style but I enjoy playing with different styles as is often required when doing different assignments. The inspiration came from Revolution Juice where I've been going for a few days now. Highly recommended. I'm still able to have some fun with it.

This satisfying salad is full of flavor, fiber and textures that are just perfect together!  I didn't end up eating my Date Truffles on the way home simply because I wasn't hungry for them, I know it sounds crazy but it's true 🙊 I drank the juice and was happy with that.  I wasn't that hungry for this meal either, so I only had a half of the serving I was planning. That means my body just isn't calling for food, because it's busy cleansing! 👌🏼 I'm eating just enough to nourish myself and will have a big water before bed.  Also did a quick workout before dinner to spark my metabolism, only 10 minutes and it did the trick. 💪🏼 This will also help me digest my dinner and sure did set my mind right too!

Fiber for the win!, Day 2 #livecleanseboston : HYDRATE hydrate hydrate 💦 

Starting the day with lemon, ginger, pure maple syrup, cayenne and warm water. Creating daily healthy habits (like this one) is what keeps me most disciplined in my cleansing, health and wellness goals. If I don't have any lemon ginger booster, I drink the warm water anyways and squeeze half a lemon in it. You can put a few slices of fresh ginger in the water too! 

Cleansing is all about giving your body what it needs to do what it already knows how to do, clean you up!  With everything we put in our mouths we are either helping or halting our bodies natural cleansing process. 
Make today a day full of helpful and healthy choices ✌🏼️❤️🌱, Day 1 #livecleanseboston : It may look like a sinner DINNER but this veggie burger is sent straight from heaven 😇 !

#juice #smoothie #cleanse  #boston #gmofree #organic #nochemicals #nopreservatives #nopesticides  #ever, This afternoon, the House of Representatives will vote on H.R. 1599 - Monsanto's Poison Pill - to make it illegal for states to pass common sense bills to label GMO foods, prohibit state or county GMO bans or regulate GMOs in any way. While the bill's author, Congressman Mike Pompeo (R-KS) calls it the “Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act” , it's really a poison pill for democracy, our Constitution, our health, and the planet.

After spending more than $100 million in the past 3 years to kill GMO labeling in the U.S., Monsanto is getting desperate because the American public is catching on and now they've struck a backroom deal with Congress from ever having to label their genetically engineered foods in America.

Just juiced some lemon, ginger and lemongrass to add to my afternoon liter of water. I drink 3 a day minimum! Works wonders for digestion, skin, energy, mental clarity ... and more! 

If you know you will be enjoying some tasty treats this weekend (food and drink) don't forget to always drink your water first.  It's my #1 rule. Don't start partying it up till you are fully hydrated, it makes ALL the difference... So start NOW by going and getting some water or naturally caffeine free tea so by tonight you will be in the clear (clear urine I mean-cuz that's how you know you're hydrated). 

Please party smart friends!
