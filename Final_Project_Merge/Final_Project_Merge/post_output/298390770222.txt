The tourbillon counteracts the effect of gravity on the movement’s most delicate components. The assembly of its exceptionally light and complex elements is a formidable challenge that takes a master watchmaker three days to execute entirely by hand.

However even at this micro scale, the arms of the cage are chamfered and polished. The spirit of Audemars Piguet expressed in every detail.

Ref. 26172SO.OO.D202CR.01, Classical purity is the defining aesthetic of the Jules Audemars Extra-Thin. For centuries the artisan has known that it is easier to add than to subtract – to indulge rather than to rationalise. Here however the mastery of the essential has produced a watch of rare presence and understated inner confidence.

At its heart lies one of the world’s thinnest selfwinding calibres; a tour de force of mechanical precision, powered by the oscillating mass, in 22 carat gold. The edges of this intricate piece are polished, while its surface is satinbrushed, all by human hand and eye.
Exceptional craftsmanship revealed through the sapphire caseback – the inner soul of a modern classic.

This iconic piece celebrates the purposeful Royal Oak strongbox architecture, and the artisanal finesse and elegance of the engine-turned “grande tapisserie” dial.

The daring use of stainless steel signifies a distinct confidence, which is offset with a crown of diamonds of ultimate pedigree. Each stone is internally flawless and perfectly matched, an alluring mastery of both watchmaker’s and jeweller’s art, and signature Audemars Piguet.

The Fall/Winter 2013 collection presentation held at FOCUS: Café Rouge was the perfect occasion to showcase the latest timepieces unveiled at SIHH including the Royal Oak Offshore Chronograph and Royal Oak Offshore Diver – for the first time both models crafted in ceramic.

“It is our honor and privilege to work with Audemars Piguet for a 3rd straight season in a row for our runway watches,” said designer Michael Bastian.  “I have a favorite story about them that I always like to share.  Very few people know that Audemars Piguet was the first watchmaker to develop a luxury sports watch in stainless steel when to the rest of the world, luxury only meant gold, diamonds and flash.  It is this special, subtle understanding of true luxury – one that does not take the obvious route or rely on stereotypical ideas of what makes something rare and precious – that makes me admire them so much.”, May your Love be as Flawless & Transparent as Diamonds can be

Happy Valentine's Day.

Ref. 26153PT.OO.D028CR.01, Sergio and Wilma Barathier started in 2006 what has now established as a tradition. On December 8th, the owners of F.B. Aurum invited their customers to Courmayeur in order to share a diner co-hosted by Audemars Piguet Italy. A wonderful opportunity to celebrate the opening of the winter season and convey Christmas wishes.

A path lit by hundreds of torches led more than 200 guests in a fairytale setting to a chalet lost in the woods. The cottage covered with fresh snow and heated by a chimney fire was the setting in which a traditional menu composed of Val d’Aosta delicacies was served with “vin brulé”, the typical wine from the region.

At the end of the evening, fireworks lit up the forest in the Val Ferret and the mountain peaks of the Monte Bianco massif. A panel made of torches with the inscription “Royal Oak 40” made the connection with the Royal Oak 40th anniversary exhibition celebrated throughout the year., The Royal Oak Offshore End of Days was the 1st commemorative timepiece between Arnold Schwarzenegger & Audemars Piguet, released in 1999 in a limited series of 500 pieces.

It all began in 1967 with the creation of self-winding Calibre 2120 in the company’s Le Brassus workshops. 
This movement was a mere 2.45 mm thick and a new world-first achievement for Audemars Piguet. Produced on the basis of this magnificent and now legendary movement, these new timepieces inspired by historical models radiate an impressive aura of elegance stemming from their contemporary lines and ultra-thin profile that endow them with an inimitable classical yet modern style.
