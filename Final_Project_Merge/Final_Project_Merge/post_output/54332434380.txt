For those who are warming up their Birds today, here are some unofficial suggestions for warming with best results: 1. Don't disturb the special placement of the meat within the pan while warming. 2. For crispy skin: warm without a cover on the pan. Use a temperature that will not burn the skin but dry it out and produce crisping., Represent: St. Ann's Bay!!, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTISKUGwKYk, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW7frSW7chM&feature=related, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv294dmi50s, OK People, Fort Hill Jerk Chicken Saturdays is now taking orders for Saturday, November 12, 2011!
