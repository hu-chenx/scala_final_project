Новогодний стол (New Year’s feast) – Russian holiday spreads are rightly famous for their закуски (appetizers). New Year celebration is the time of plenty when столы ломятся (tables are breaking) under all the delicious dishes. Whatever you decide to serve at your Russian New Year, make sure to have a bowl of салат Оливье (Olivier salad). Sparkling wine is usually reserved for the first toast of the New Year just as the clock strikes midnight. The traditional first toast is simple:

С Новым Годом, с новым счастьем! – To the New Year, to the new happiness!

Happy Happy New Year to Everyone! We wish you all the Best!

Love,
