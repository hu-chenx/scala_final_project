It's 1984, and a young businessman showed up at Doyle's Cafe, so angry that his face was busting out red, because the posh Ritz-Carlton told him his beer "wasn't up to their standards." Mainly Bud drinkers at the time, Doyle's owner Mr. Burke, put it on tap anyway. In 10 minutes, everyone loved it! The beer was Samuel Adams Boston Lager. So who was that anxious, persistent sales rep, you ask? He was none other than Jim Koch, the founder and chairman of the Boston Beer Co.
