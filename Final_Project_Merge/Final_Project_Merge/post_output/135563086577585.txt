Here's an Open Table review from October 10th: "What a wonderful first experience at Farmstead Table! Had heard good things about it and took an out-of-town friend for dinner during a visit. It was a delightful meal from start to finish - hard to choose among the tantalizing things on the menu, and nothing disappointed. Lovely to have a variety of small plates to share, each made carefully with complementary flavors. Good selection of things for the gluten-challenged. Excellent execution on everything and we both appreciated the effort placed on local ingredients. Nice wine list, quiet enough for easy conversation; all in all a great meal. Will definitely return."
