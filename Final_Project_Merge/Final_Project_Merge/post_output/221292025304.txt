Each student presented the case of their six year-old client to a jury comprised of experienced trial lawyers, esteemed Judges from the Court of Common Pleas, in Cuyahoga County, media representatives, and child advocates.  This year taking home first place was Ian Chaves, from University of Akron School of Law, David Walters, from Case Western Reserve University School of Law finished second, while Brandi Roberts, from University of Akron School of Law, finished third. These top three finishers received scholarship awards in the amount of $750, $500, and $200 respectively.

"Last week, I was fortunate and honored to have been selected to represent Akron Law at the Marine Corps Officer Educators’ and Key Leaders’ Workshop aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.

The purpose of the workshop was to provide educators from across the country with an opportunity to see first-hand how intelligent and qualified college and law students are recruited, screened, and developed into Marine Officers. 

During my week, we visited Officer Candidate School, witnessed training and drills, and participated in a leadership reaction course. We engaged in a martial arts demonstration and attending various briefings. We also attended the Sunset Parade at the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia and took a flight on an osprey from HMX-1.

Having no prior military experience myself, this experience was insightful and memorable. I have a much better understanding of the process and the caliber of men and women who are Marine Corps Officers, and will be better able to assist our students who desire to explore this career option. I am most grateful to the Marine Corps and our Officer Selection Officer hosts who ensured our safety, comfort and enjoyment throughout the entire week, but most importantly for their service to our country.", Thanks to Akron Law’s Law & Leadership program, local high school students from underserved communities are one step closer to reaching their goals.

The University of Akron trial program is National Champion once again! In a four day competition lasting from April 10-13, 2014, the Akron team consisting of advocates Joseph Darwal and Justin Workman, along with their witnesses Elizabeth Emanuel and C. Adam Carro took on the top trial programs in the country in the American Association for Justice’s Student Trial Advocacy Competition in Santa Monica, California.  When all was said and done, Akron brought home the School’s 4th national title in 11 years.

The Akron team’s climb to the top began several weeks ago on March 20-23, when they bested a field of teams from Case Western, Michigan State, Cleveland State, Thomas Cooley, University of Cincinnati, Capital University, and University of Toledo in a hard fought regional competition that, across the nation, narrowed the field from 224 teams down to the top 14.  

Over the first two days of the national competition, the Akron team lost its first two trials to the eventual #1 and #3 seeded teams, New York University and Duquesne University, in 2-1 decisions that were decided by the narrowest of margins.  The disappointing early results meant that, in order to make the cut to the final 8, the Akron team would need to sweep all three judges in its round against South Texas College of Law, a perennial top 5 trial advocacy program in the country; and that is exactly what they did.

From that point on, the Akron team could not be stopped.  Joseph Darwal and Justin Workman consistently won the jury over during opening statement, witness examination and closing argument, while witnesses Elizabeth Emanuel and C. Adam Carro laid out Akron’s case on direct examination and confounded opposing counsel on cross.  Regardless of which side of the case Akron presented – Plaintiff or Defense - the results were the same.  Together, the team swept through the Quarterfinal and Semi-Final rounds against the Charlotte School of Law and Stetson University setting up a championship round against Syracuse University on Sunday afternoon. In the end, Akron won over every member of the championship round jury panel, consisting of Los Angeles’s most prominent trial attorneys, in a 3-0 decision that capped off an unprecedented comeback from the preliminary rounds.

The victory was the well earned by all four members of the competition team. The team was coached by Akron Law graduates Larry Sutter (’89) and Kevin Kita (’11) with the law firm of Sutter O’Connell, and Tony Wise (’13), with the Stark County Public Defender’s Office., Akron Law’s Mock Trial Team is National Champion once again!

Adam Carro. The latter team took the regional title and will travel to Santa Monica, California on April 10-13 with the opportunity to bring home Akron's ninth national title. Both teams were coached by Larry Sutter (’89), Kevin Kita (’11) and Tony Wise (’13).

This program is a way to build understanding.”

Read the entire article here http://ow.ly/so2hv, In his recent essay, The Behavior of Federal Judges: A View from the D.C. Circuit, 97 Judicature 109 (2013), D.C. Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg refers extensively to Associate Dean William Jordan’s 2001 article Judges, Ideology, and Policy in the Administrative State: Lessons from a Decade of Hard Look Remands of EPA Rules, 53 Admin. L. Rev. 45  (2001). Dean Jordan’s article is an empirical study examining the effects of political ideology on decisions by judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Jordan concludes that, on balance, “we have a picture of careful judging, without the strong ideological influences that have been predicted in other studies.”

Judge Ginsburg notes in his essay, that Professor Jordan’s approach to examining circuit court decisions “would capture the complexity of such a case by examining each issue,” and concludes that, “It is no small consolation to see the D.C. Circuit absolved-yet again-of the charge, so often levied in the vacuous but vociferous political debates over the confirmation of a new judge, that the court is a political partisan.”

At the annual conference, legal experts discussed the controversy surrounding whether requirements for disclosing ingredients are considered regulating speech or regulating conduct.

Remember to take care of yourself – plenty of sleep and some exercise along with all that studying. Go for it!" William S. Jordan, III, Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, “Remember that each student has his or her own manner of learning. If you have a technique that works well for you, stick with it. Do not abandon it at the last minute because your peers are doing something differently. Always study “smart,” not “hard,” meaning you should study when you are rested, fed and have exercised.  Neglecting yourself will mean that you retain less of what you study and that you will not be able to access it as well or as quickly when you really need it. And try to get up and stretch, perhaps do a quick 5 minute walk, at least once an hour.  If you need to talk, please come and see me.  I will be happy to lend an ear and some advice!” Donna Palmer-Schmitz, Esq., Assistant Dean of Academic Success & Institutional Assessment, Latoya Peterson, a UA law student, is working to help collect 9,200 signatures needed in the Akron-Canton area as part of a statewide petition drive to place the issue of Medicaid expansion on the ballot.

“I think the most amazing experience of any legal internship is always the people you have the opportunity to meet, like my supervising attorney, Pierce J. Reed.

Every case I analyzed for discretionary review presented a novel legal question and a broad policy standpoint that showed me not only how different, yet equally strong, opposing arguments on issues can really be, but also how far-reaching the scope of a Supreme Court decision truly is. In addition, these legal arguments are being presented by the finest attorneys in the State of Ohio, which gave me an opportunity to observe and learn from the best.”, Join Maria Klutinoty Edwards and Collin Wise, from Tzangas Plakas Mannos Ltd., as they discuss how to distinguish yourself as a law student seeking a job in today’s legal market on Wednesday, October 9 at 5:15 p.m. in Room 133., Zippy traveled to Barcelona, Spain this past July with alumnus Ben Carro (’12) and 3L Adam Carro.

Great job James!, It's exam eve! Best of luck to all of our students on their exams! And to help ease the stress, here are some very wise words from Prof. Cook: "Identify and understand the big, broad areas of each subject first. Then, identify any important tests and learn the relevant elements of the test. Next, makes sure you can spot the big issues in hypos and facts that support the various elements of the tests, pro and con. Many essays are written so that the facts can be argued both ways. Just because you have answered the question one way (pro), doesn't mean it can't be answered another way (con). Don't be a slave to your outline. Many things on your outline are not important, relatively speaking, and you will waste time memorizing them. This will be a trying time for you. There's lots of unknowns. But, you will get through - just like thousands of UA lawyers before you. If you are freaking out, you can always email me at scook@uakron.edu and we can talk.", Our annual Alumni Awards and Class Reunion Dinner is just around the corner on May 17.

This may sound obvious, but it is a common area of failure.", It's exam eve! Here's some advice from Prof. Steve Cook: "Identify and understand the big, broad areas of each subject first. Then, identify any important tests and learn the relevant elements of the test. Next, makes sure you can spot the big issues in hypos and facts that support the various elements of the tests, pro and con. Many essay are written so that the facts can be argued both ways. Just because you have answered the question one way (pro), doesn't mean it can't be answered another way (con). Don't be a slave to your outline. Many things on your outline are not important, relatively speaking, and you will waste time memorizing them. This will be a trying time for you. There's lots of unknowns. But, you will get through - just like thousands of U of A lawyers before you. If you are freaking out, you can always email me at scook@uakron.edu and we can talk.", Exams begin tomorrow and we know how stressful it can be, especially for our 1Ls.

Try to keep some balance in your life (health, family - then law). 2. You will be called upon in class and sometimes you will get it right, sometimes not. Don't fret over it - learn from it. 3. Keep up with your reading. 4. Outlines should be that - outlines. Forty page outlines are not outlines, they are novels. 5. One size does not fit all - each of your professors is different, with a different approach and different expectations. Get used to it. 6. Don't let frustrations, concerns, uncertainties grow - talk to someone. The Sounding Board is a great, confidential resource for advice and counsel. You'll hear about it during Orientation week.", Professor Carro is leading the Akron Bar Association's effort to remove dirty politics from local judicial campaigns. Check out this Akron Beacon Journal story at bit.ly/NksTxZ, Advice for 1Ls from College Program Specialist Anthony Colucci: "I overheard an upper-division student talking with a small group of entering students yesterday, and she gave them some sound advice that I think would be worth sharing. They had asked her what was appropriate to wear to school, and she said 'Someone once told me, if it’s something you wouldn’t want a prospective employer to see you wearing, don’t wear it to school.' ”, Advice for 1Ls from Lia Evans, Class of 2012, and our director of alumni and annual fund: "Work hard, study hard, and always be prepared for class. It sounds obvious, but sometimes it is easier said than done. Develop a weekly schedule, and stick to it… just don’t forget to schedule in some time for yourself, your family, and friends. You’re going to be busy, but you’ll get into a routine and it will all get easier with time. I promise, you can still have a life while you’re in law school – just stay focused and work hard and efficiently during your study time. Good luck to all of you!", It's orientation week - welcome 1Ls! We'll be sharing advice from our faculty and staff all week. Alumni - please share your advice below. From Professor Marge Koosed: "Congratulations! You will soon be immersed in preparing for the best profession in the world, one that can help heal the world - pursuing justice.

Thousands have passed the exam before you. Have confidence in yourself!”, Some words of encouragement from Assistant Dean Lauri Thorpe:
Exercise.   Go for a run or take a brisk walk.  Do sit-ups.  Use the exercise machines at your hotel.  Eat Properly.   Feed your brain with protein.   Take in some carbs for energy.   Don’t over-eat.  Drink plenty of H20.  Avoid too much caffeine.  Avoid alcohol.  Positive Vision and Self-Talk.   Have confidence in your ability.   If you have a tendency to think negative thoughts or borrow trouble by rehearsing “What If” scenarios in your mind, stop.   Remember your academic achievements and how much you have prepared for the bar exam.   Now put that preparation to work for you.   You are ready for this challenge!   Believe in yourself!  Remain calm.   Breathe deeply.    Slow down.    Give yourself plenty of time in the morning to get up and start your day.   Set 2 alarms.  Ask a friend to call you to be sure you get up in time and wish you well.   Stretch.    Close your eyes and visualize yourself in a happy place after the bar exam.   Don’t talk about the exam at the end of the day.   Enjoy a nice dinner and relax each evening., Sage advice from Professor Will Huhn:
"1. Life is not lived in a vacuum. Besides the task in front of me I am lucky to have other obligations to friends and family that I must also fulfill. 
2. I can only do my best in preparation for the task. In this setting I could not control what questions were asked or what the passing grade was. Whatever I cannot control I must not spend any time or energy worrying about.
3. Many thousands of persons have stood for the bar, almost all of whom experienced the same frustrations and fears. We endured, and so can you.", Some Bar Exam Words of Wisdom from Professor Steve Cook:
"Try your best to get rest Monday evening. Study if it makes you feel better. No heavy meal Monday evening and not too much alcohol, if any. Plan your route to Veteran's Hall. Have a wake-up call and some form of backup in your room. Make a checklist of things to take to the exam - and don't forget to take your watch. Morning of bar, don't eat a heavy breakfast - but eat something. Meditate, pray, deep breathe, exercise - some or all of the above on Monday. After the exam resist the urge to talk to anyone about the exam. There's no upside to that and there is plenty of downside. You can't change what's in the bag. Focus on passing and the fact that it will all be over by Thursday at the noon hour. Plan something for the weekend to treat yourself. Friday will be a weird day - you won't know what to do with yourself. But, you will soon be a lawyer - trust me on this.", Akron Law is quoted in a Plain Dealer story on class size, as well as the job market in today's economy.

Don’t discuss the exam with anyone. If you do, someone will mention an issue or argument that you didn’t see, and it will make you crazy. The truth is, that issue may not have even been on the exam, but it will still make you crazy. I’m a firm believer that discussing exams before you receive your grade is a huge cause of stress and serves almost no constructive purpose.", Exam Advice from Professor Will Huhn: By definition lawyers lose half their cases, but that does not mean that a lawyer has failed in any particular case.  If the dispute was justly, professionally, and peacefully resolved, it means that the lawyers on both sides did their duty.   Keep in mind that every lawyer who has ever practiced was in your place at one time, and we all worried that we would fail to meet our own expectations or that we would disappoint others.  It is important to put that fear aside, in school, in practice, and in life.  We can only do our best, and our best is always enough., Exam Advice from Professor Stewart Moritz: "Don’t study the night before an exam.  Finish studying in the afternoon, then take the night off.  Catch a movie; go to a ball game; have a nice dinner.  Keep that brain fresh, because law exams are not only about what you know, but are also (even more) about having the ability to recognize what you’re being asked.  Cramming doesn’t help, and wearing yourself out can really hurt your performance.  Also, after the exam, don’t take the night off—start right in studying for the next exam.  Don’t dwell on what you just finished doing.  You can’t do any better on that test you just took, but you can do better on the one that’s coming up.", "Organize your study schedule, abide by it and build in time for sleep and exercise. There will always be challenges of one sort or another. This is the time to learn to deal with those challenges. They only become more serious as a lawyer, for then you are not only responsible for yourself but for your clients as well." - Exam Advice from Professor J. Dean Carro, Hey students - need a study break? The Academic Success Office is hosting a stress-relief day today. Feel free to stop by their office for snacks, drinks, and stress-relieving activities., "Pace yourself. Take study breaks when you need them. Get some fresh air/exercise to clear your head. Go back to your studying refreshed and you will be more productive." - Exam Advice from Professor Alan Newman, Exam Advice from Professor Sarah Cravens: "On writing essay answers: When you think you are at the end of a sentence, erase the period, write the word "because" and then finish the sentence." What advice do you have for our students?, Exams begin tomorrow. Best of luck to all our students!!, Have you come out of your food coma yet? "I am grateful for the support and friendship of such wonderful colleagues, students and Akron Law alums." - Barbara Weinzierl, director of Career Planning and Placement #akronlawgivesthanks, A very happy Thanksgiving to everyone!

Dean Carro #akronlawgivesthanks, "I’m grateful for the Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice of the American Bar Association, through which I meet the most intelligent, exciting, and challenging administrative law experts in the country and am able to contribute to the continuing development of administrative law, which affects everyone in  more ways than we can know." - Bill Jordan, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs #akronlawgivesthanks, "I am thankful for our students. They inspire me and give me hope for the future of the country." - Professor Richard Aynes #akronlawgivesthanks, "I am thankful that, in a time of economic unrest, I not only have a job, but I get to work with excellent colleagues and students." - Anthony Colucci, College Program Specialist #akronlawgivesthanks, In the spirit of Thanksgiving, we asked our faculty and staff to share what they are thankful for and will be sharing those answers throughout the week beginning with Professor Steve Cook who shared "I am thankful for my students, from whom I learn so much."
