#Waffles #Belgium #Boston #Foodtruck, The Zinneken's truck will hit the road the first week of January! Exact locations and times to be announced.
We wanted before all thank the Chicken & Rice Guys for all their precious advice and tips. These guys are on top of everything and never hesitate to help others. There is a reason why they are the most successful food truck in Boston!

Happy holidays everyone!, Zinnetruck by night
#Belgium #waffles #foodtruck #Boston, Stickers next!
#zinnetruck #bostonfoodtrucks, Fresh paint #zinnetruck #bostonfoodtrucks, Zinnetruck is one of the few food trucks whose kitchen is all electric. It was a challenge to find a solution to power all the machines we had (around 9,000 watts!). 

We wanted to use propane as it's much cleaner and quieter than diesel or gas generators. We ended up putting 2 propane generators using 2 different circuit breakers. We re-worked the suspension and raised the truck a few inches as the equipment was really heavy and would have been a challenge to climb over curbs during the winter. Waffle irons, coffee machines, chocolate melter, water boiler (for tea) are equipment that get really hot and are difficult to put away before driving. We are glad we found a solution to have everything clipped down and we thank our builder for that. 

We are very excited to be on the roads soon, brave the cold winter to offer you the best fresh warm waffles in the world. It took longer than we thought to build Zinnetruck. But we feel the time spent to look at every details was very important to give you the best service from day 1. 

We hope you all a happy Thanksgiving!
