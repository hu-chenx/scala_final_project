Choose your favorite sauce: soy-garlic or spicy. On the side you get slaw and pickled daikon; the sweet-puckery flavors pair perfectly with the spicy chicken."

According to our kick-ass waiter, DK, Allston's restaurant has a larger variety of items on their menu compared to New York's. Even though Bon Chon is known for its fried chicken, there is also sushi, korean bbq, lunch boxes, as well as other many other foods." ..oh yea DK~~, Guys, let us know what songs you want us to play during lunch/dinner :), "....our waitor was not only attentive, but attractive too ; )"

"The coleslaw they have is the BEST. COLESLAW. EVER!! Just had to put that out there."
I agree. :), Joe M.'s quote from Yelp.com
"Fantastic food. Went with some co workers. Sushi was top notch to say the least. Their chicken is bomb. We had the spicy chicken which was a different kind of spicy, almost an annoying spicy. Wouldn't recommend for the faint of heart. I haven't had a chance to try their Sake selection but I wouldn't doubt it would be nothing but superb. This place will be getting my business often."
YAY!, Hilarious quote from Brian D. at Yelp.com:
"Bon Chon. How do you do it? I swear you must put a little crack in your chicken because I know I will be coming back."
