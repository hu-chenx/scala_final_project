The Precursors - A Brief Cocktail History

When we think of the ubiquitous classic cocktails which have stood the test of time, the originals tend to stand out, the cocktails which spawned all that we know today; the Manhattan, the Martini, the Margarita, the Sidecar…but if these are the Greek Gods in the Pantheon of classic cocktails mustn't there be Titans from which they spawned?  Let us explore the original conception of the drinks we know and love today and see how their evolution came about.  Perhaps by the end of the day we will have created the next great classic (or at least the next fad…)
