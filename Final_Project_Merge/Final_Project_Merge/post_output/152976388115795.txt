Newfane, NY
Paul Strobel has been raising natural beef for over 20 years on his family's farm which has been in operation for 45 years. His parents chose to begin raising beef in order to provide beef without added hormones. Paul maintains a cow herd of around 90 head and raises about 40 head annually for beef. All stock which are raised on the farm are rotationally grazed.  His farm is located on 350 acres in Newfane, NY. Paul and his wife, Marjorie have two children: Emily (2 years) and Sara (8 months).

Forty-five years ago, Paul Strobel's dad wanted to give his family meat that was not injected with hormones, so he began farming with one lone beef cow. Today, Paul and his family tend as many as 80 brood cows and 225 additional animals on their 300 acre farm. Paul's herd is entirely Angus, after 15 years of breeding only to Angus bulls. Following in his father's footsteps, Paul has never fed any of their cattle antibiotics or animal byproducts, and he has never used hormones.

The Strobel family farm is located about 40 minutes from the roar of Niagara Falls in upstate New York. The family grows all of their hay for the animals themselves, and they purchase only New York grown, whole grains for feeding when finishing the beef. To the Strobel family this ensures that their beef is the finest it can be., It's back!!
