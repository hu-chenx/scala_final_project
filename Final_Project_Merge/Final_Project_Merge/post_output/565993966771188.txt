#pho #yelpboston, Dearest family, friends and patrons of Xinh Xinh,

It is with profound sadness that we announce our closing of this location at the end of May 2015. 
Due to irreconcilable differences with the landlord, we have been forced to move out of our current location in Chinatown and relocate.
Over the last decade, we have been fortunate enough to meet and make some great friends and acquaintances while serving up your favorite Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.
We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to you all for the support, friendship and patronage through the years.
You all have made this an unforgettable experience!
Please stay tuned on Facebook for an announcement on our new location!!!

Until May 26th, please don't hesitate to stop in and get your Xinh Xinh fix while you still can!

Thank you and may we meet again soon!
