617-661-0009, We asked Chef-Owner Jason Bond why the new five-course menu (which starts 9-9-15 at Bondir Cambridge) is well suited to Chef Brendan Joy's cooking style and sensibility?  Here's what he said.

"Brendan has a very creative personal style developed over many years working with some of the best chefs in the country.  He has a lot of ideas and cool technique to share, and this is a great way for a diner to get the most out of his abundant talents." 

http://www.bondircambridge.com/new-five-course-menu, Before you start your weekend, we just have 
a little announcement to make! ;)

"Setting The Table For A New Chapter: Announcing The New Five Course Menu At Bondir Cambridge" 

http://tinyurl.com/q98hl4s, Had a great staff meeting yesterday. We may have brought our own beer, but Chef & team really BROUGHT the food! 

Can't wait to tell you what we talked about! Soon!!

#FoodGoneTooQuick2TakePics, Don't let summer go without a fight! Keep it going through dinnertime with this recipe BostonChefs.com calls a "light and refreshing dish from Brendan Joy ... perfect for the summer months." #BigStripers #StripedBass  #NewEnglandSeafood  http://www.bostonchefs.com/recipe/grilled-striped-bass-with-charred-cucumber-sauce/, Wow! Thank you Conde Nast Traveler!! We are honored to be one of your #CambridgeMa picks! (PS - We're "packed" on wknds mostly, give us a try weeknights for better odds!)

"For dinner, shake things up by indulging in the high-concept food craze that’s sweeping Cambridge. Two restaurants that nail it are Tony Maws’s French-inspired Craigie on Main and the farm-to-table Bondir Restaurant. (Both spots are pretty popular and typically packed, so make your reservations ahead of time.)" 

http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-08-31/the-perfect-weekend-in-boston?tw=social, Re-post from Saturday's Instagram because: pretty!, Our Summer Weeknight Menu Special continues:
3 courses, $55 per person.  Please give us a call, 617-661-0009, null, null, We could not be happier to celebrate the one year anniversary of Chef Brendan Joy joining the Bondir team as a passionate and creative leader and Chef de Cuisine.  We are in such good hands with this talented chef.  #ChefdeCuisine  #ChefBrendanJoy #BondirFamily http://bit.ly/1VaTceH

Here is an interview we published in a newsletter when Brendan 1st arrived! 

****************************************************
August 2014

Same Vision, New Voice.
 
In his own words:

How would you describe your cooking philosophy?  

"My philosophy is American with Italian influences, and it includes trying to use older styles and techniques and simplifying them to enhance the ingredients that we source locally. I love working with our farmers. I love to use a small amount of technique to showcase and to make the food a little bit playful." 
 
What were your impressions of Chef Jason Bond's menu at Bondir?  

"There was definitely a farm-driven aspect to it, which I enjoyed, especially coming from my recent job at SPQR, where we had our own farm. I learned a lot there about how to use all of the vegetable. I think when you're younger you don't really learn how to do all that. You grow into learning how to do more and more with vegetable-based dishes."

What similarities do you see between yours and Chef Bond's style?  

"I think we both love to support and work with farmers, and to respect and not overpower the ingredients. That's kind of how I think our philosophies and  styles are similar."

You've worked in many highly regarded restaurants in and out of Boston, if you had to pick one thing you've learned from the many great chefs you've worked with what would it be?  

"I think the one thing that I've learned above all else is consistency. I'm trying to build that here now, to build a consistent standard. Granted, the standards were already here when I arrived, so in order to create the consistency of the food I'm developing a few more systems for the kitchen. But consistency throughout my career has been the constant."

You're a native of Connecticut, and have worked in Boston for many years, what do you like about being a chef in New England?   

"I think New England has some of the best seafood. The West Coast has great seafood but there's just not as much of a selection. The diversity of products and seasons that I get to work with in New England is something that is really special, and I don't take it for granted." 

What ideas are you working on for the future at Bondir?   

"My mind is always focused on dishes in terms of what is available at the fish market and on the farms.  And right now I am just trying to gear up for winter; we're doing a bunch of preserves and fermentations. So that's what August and the beginning of September will look like for me.

"Jason and I are working with a local ceramic potter and we are really excited about that. It's fascinating to collaborate with an artist to create dishes for a restaurant. It's a good collaboration. Bondir is a local, farm-driven restaurant, so I think it is a great idea for us to work with a local artist to keep that theme alive."

You recently posted some pictures on Twitter of dishes you've served at Bondir. What ingredients are you working with these days that you particularly really enjoy? 

"I posted the picture of the Fava Bean Agnolotti because pasta is a large passion of mine, almost on the borderline of obsessive. I'm just extremely passionate about pasta.  (Pictured below: Fava Bean Agnolotti, Pistachio, Goat's Milk Gouda, and Yogurt) 

"For the Confit Mussels, I was really intrigued by how large the mussels were from American Mussel. I was trying to do a mussel salad with a lot of the fresh romano beans but I wanted it to have good acidity so that it would be light and fresh for when we had a few weeks where it was really hot out." (Pictured below: Confit Mussels, Romano Bean, Red Currents, and Lemon Balm)

"I also photographed the Rouen Duck.
I've been looking for different ways to plate the duck. I think I did it with corn pudding. Corn pudding is something that I learned in New York form a mentor of mine, Jonathan Benno. It's basically just fresh corn that is grated really finely, and then cooked slowly to release all of the natural starch." (Pictured below: Rouen Duck , Corn Pudding, Chanterelles, and Black Garlic), Welcome to #CambridgeMA Harvard Class of 2019!!!!!  #flightofthebumblebee  #Harvard2019, Please join us for August Weeknights at Bondir!

People have really been enjoying our "Summer Thursday" menu format, so we've decided to offer it all weeknights for the rest of the month!!  #Summertime in #CambMa  http://tinyurl.com/o4mm7jf, How's your pantry looking lately? Some good advice from Amanda Hesser.

"Think of your ingredients in 3 levels of use frequency: Level 1 are the ingredients you use most; level 2 are those you use frequently but not daily; and level 3 are those you use now and then. If you have a level 4, put these ingredients in the garbage. (Just kidding, but not really.)", Bondir Cambridge is proud to participate.

Good night to check the pantry and do some cooking!, "The panelists spoke about how they are using whole grains on their restaurant menus and how the public is responding to them. I was very excited about the dishes they described and couldn’t wait to get back to my kitchen to try out some of their ideas, like Ana Sortun’s bulgur and squash kibbeh made with freshly milled wheat, the teff polenta that Jason Bond seasons with chipotle, and the farrotto (farro risotto) that Barry Maiden makes with farro that he has soaked and then broken down in a food processor.", Dinner Menu January 15th, 2015

Here's a little color to liven up this grey Saturday. The CHIOGGIA BEET is a featured ingredient in our Day Boat Golden Tile Fish with Roasted Macomber & Gilfeather Turnip, Pickled Quince, Shaved Chioggia Beet, and Meyer Lemon Sauce. 

"Look at this pretty striped vegetable! Artificially colored? Genetically modified? From an alien planet? No, it's a chiogga beet, also known as the candy cane beet and the bullseye beet, and it's a heirloom beet from Italy.The chioggia beet came from the Italian coastal town of Chioggia, near Venice. It's been around since the early 19th-century. It tastes just like regular purple beets, maybe a little sweeter. The skin is a hot pink/fuchsia color, and when sliced open, the inside has beautiful pink and white stripes. Like any other beet, it can be prepared the same way; steamed, sauteed, roasted, and pickled. The greens are also  edible. Sadly, the beautiful stripes fade when the beet is cooked." - thekitchn.com, null, null, null, “@devrafirst: So much TLC at Fairsted Kitchen in Brookline. Review here: http://t.co/77lA6EHpMH”
