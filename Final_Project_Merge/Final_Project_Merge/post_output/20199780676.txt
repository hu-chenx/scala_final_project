This album was taken a year ago, we just wanted to relive this moment. #BostonStrong, “Courage is not having the strength to go on; it is going on when you don't have the strength.” ― Theodore Roosevelt

Today marks the one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombing that took the lives of 3 people and injured another 265 people. It was a low point for the city of Boston and is something that we will never forget in our lifetime. Over the past year, many of the people that were injured, have shown us what it means to be strong and have given us hope. When they were down and out, they could have given up and become angry with the world, but they didn't. They rose to the occasion and lifted a city when it needed to be lifted. 

Boston Strong was the motto of the city this year, and it will continue to be as we get stronger. Take the time today to reflect on the good from April 15, 2013 and not the bad. Take the time to thank a police officer, fireman, EMT, or anyone that helps us on a daily basis. 

Thank you to the survivors, we only wish that we could be as strong as you. Your strength has been an inspiration to everyone.
