What's a great way to spread awareness about domestic violence PURPLE LIPS. Start the conversation with your family, friends, coworkers when they compliment you on the purple lipstick. Not enough people are having this conversation let's break the silence. Rock your purple lips, talk about your purple lips and post it with the hashtags #purplelips4dva üíú. If you don't know the signs get the book, inform yourself and share the information. Prevention is better and much easier then intervention. It's so hard to change the mind of one that's already in an abusive relationship. I give tips on how you can help them and others to learn the signs.

I commend Donata for sharing her story. She is candid in the telling of her story and the reader will be deeply affected. I admire her courage for ending her abusive marriage and I applaud her for explaining her reasons for staying so many years under the thumb of such violence. With her unabridged candor she opens the door to a sensitive, ignored and misunderstood topic. 

Not only does Donata share her experience with domestic violence but she gives signs for women to be aware of a potential abuser. Statistics are noted leaving you staggered. She also includes several organizations providing aid. 

This is a must read for females of all ages, learn the signals, educate yourself on the myriad of ways abuse reveals itself. Donata discusses the phases of abuse, again doling out preventative information so measures can be taken and awareness is commonplace. This is not only a story of a woman's survival but a handbook of sorts for empowerment. 

The greatest gift we can give females is the gift of knowledge, empowerment and self esteem. The value of self worth is essential in the fight against domestic violence. 

After I read Donata's story it occurred to me society continually asks the ignorant question of Why didn't she leave? Why does/did she stay? INSTEAD society should be asking the ABUSER Why did you hit her? How could you do that to a woman? Why didn't you get help? Why? The questions need to be answered AND directed to the ABUSER NOT THE VICTIM/SURVIVOR. 

I am a survivor, albeit not anywhere on the level of Donata's situation. I was four months pregnant when I experienced my FIRST AND LAST taste of domestic violence. I walked away immediately and never returned, vowing to never be treated as such in this lifetime again. No one knew of my situation, not surprising since society assumes all is well if signs aren't obvious, stereotypes aren't fed. What goes on behind closed doors is unknown until it escalates to the point of recognition. 

Once again, this is a must read, this could save a life, be the life ring someone desperately needs, this could be the answer the woman behind unsuspecting closed doors needs. Donata's story could end the torture a 16 year old girl is facing but doesn't know where or who to turn to due to fear or embarrassment. Highly highly recommend this informative and inspiring story depicting the facts and truth of domestic violence from a woman who survived seven years of hell, desperate to piece together her life and that of her son. A brutally honest voice from the mind of a victim turned survivor., Retweeted Kym Crawford (@dazeereads):

In this workshop, she spoke about her story of surviving an abuse relationship of 7 years. It was amazing to see the kids/teens asking so many questions on why she stayed so long, what her thought process was during the relationship and more. The education needs to start earlier for our youth.

Adding Doses of HOPE Daily Foundation's mission is to encourage, empower and elevate individuals and families with resources that will improve their overall mental and emotional wellness. Our Foundation offers several programs to individuals from all walks of life. Through our programs women, men and teens are challenged to work on deep core issues in hopes of healing from the inside out. Our programs and events focus on challenges from everyday life where we put our E¬≥ (Encourage ‚Ä¢ Empower ‚Ä¢ Elevate) spin on it.

The foundation believes that it takes hard work and unity to impact our community. Therefore, we have created several partnerships with other agencies, faith based organizations and schools in the Tri County Area of (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties). Through these partnerships we have been able to connect with various organizations and make an impact one person at a time. One of our collaborations has resulted in our Annual Women's Empowerment Expo during Domestic Violence Awareness month.

Adding Doses of HOPE Daily looks to continue making connections with different organizations to empower our families as a unit and especially our youth. Our youth are our future, we aspire to build their character and give them the confidence they need to face every aspect of their lives. Allow us to E¬≥ you, your organization or your teen(s).

‚Ä¢She apologizes for his behavior and makes excuses for him. 
‚Ä¢She loses interest in activities that she used to enjoy. 
‚Ä¢She stops seeing friends and family members and becomes more isolated. 
‚Ä¢When your daughter and her boyfriend are together, he calls her names and puts her down in front of other people. 
‚Ä¢He acts extremely jealous of others who pay attention to her, especially other guys. 
‚Ä¢He thinks or tells your daughter that you don't like him. 
‚Ä¢He controls her behavior, checking up on her constantly, calling and paging her, demanding to know who she has been with. 
‚Ä¢She casually mentions his violent behavior, but laughs it off as a joke. 
‚Ä¢She often has unexplained injuries, or the explanations she offers don't make sense. 
‚Ä¢You see him violently lose his temper, striking or breaking objects.

Random advice lol, Every word you speak matters. Something you say may seem insignificant to you, but to someone else those words can be life changing. When you use your words to lift someone‚Äôs spirit and speak words of vision and life over them, you are depositing seeds that will last throughout eternity. 

It's especially important to speak vision into our children. As a parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, teacher or friend, the children in your life need to hear on a regular basis that they can do something great with their lives. As parents, our words carry incredible weight. That‚Äôs why you should never put a child down. Don‚Äôt ever say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slow, clumsy or dumb. Why can‚Äôt you make good grades like your sister? Why can‚Äôt you hit the baseball like your cousin?‚Äù Those words are seeds. They can take root and affect that child many years later. Too many people have been crippled by low expectations. But today, all of that can change. Today, you can start to speak vision over yourself and over the people in your life. Today, you can call out the seeds of greatness in others and stir up the gift of God inside. Today, speak life, speak hope and speak vision!

http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/1595.html, Types of Depression 

Although people with depression may exhibit many of the same symptoms, thoughts and feelings, there are actually several different types of depression. Your doctor can evaluate your symptoms to make a proper diagnosis. Each type of depression has different patterns, triggers, diagnostic criteria and treatment methods. 

Major Depression, which affects about 25% of people at least once in their lifetime, interferes with one's ability to work, study, sleep, eat and enjoy once pleasurable activities. Many common life changes can trigger major depression, such as losing a loved one (death, divorce, break-ups), fighting with someone, moving, graduating, changing careers, and retiring. Abuse (physical, mental or sexual) and soci al isolation are also common causes. Antidepressant medication and talk therapy are common treatments for this form of depression. 

Chronic Depression, also called dysthymia, is a relatively mild but chronic form of depression that affects over 10 million Americans. People with chronic depression are able to function in their daily lives, but have extreme difficulty finding pleasure in normal activities, and experience feelings of sadness and emptiness that may persist for years. Some people with chronic depression find talk therapy alone to be effective, but antidepressant medications can also help. 

Double Depression describes the condition of a person who experiences both major depression and chronic depression at the same time. Typically, people with double depression experience a bout of major depression for a while, followed by the milder chronic depression. 

Seasonal Depression, known as Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD, typically occurs during the colder, darker months (but can rarely occur during the summer). People with SAD experience depressive symptoms at the same time each year. Treatment can involve talk therapy, antidepressants, and light therapy. Lifestyle changes can also prevent the onset of SAD. 

Other less common but more serious forms of depression include manic depression (bipolar disorder), psychotic depression (depression accompanied by hallucinations and delusions), and postpartum depression. No matter what form your depression takes, talk with your doctor to find the best treatment plan for you.

http://adhdmanagement.com/get-comfortable-being-uncomfortable-in-order-to-manage-adult-adhd/, Breaking the Cycle of Overwhelm
When learning how to Break the Cycle of Overwhelm, you have to learn how to take really good care of yourself, and that often means creating strong boundaries and saying "no" when things are requested of you.
I've worked with a number of clients who say "yes" to everything because they feel guilty saying "no." They get roped into all sorts of commitments‚Äîfrom volunteer work to airport pickups to doing other people's work‚Äîbecause they are afraid to say "no."
Saying "no" can be dreadfully uncomfortable. You may feel like a bad person, you may have a sense of guilt, and you may even piss off a few people. But until you get past that uncomfortable feeling of saying "no," you'll find yourself stressed out and over-committed.

http://www.addinschool.com/elementary.htm, Depression is a medical condition, not a personal weakness. People who suffer from depression should seek medical treatment, although many don't. Left untreated, depression can last for weeks, months or even years and increase the risk of other problems, including: 
Increased difficulty making decisions and facing life's challenges. 
A weakened immune system, resulting in more and longer-lasting illnesses. 
Insomnia, which leads to fatigue, reduced mental clarity, and trouble concentrating. 
A higher risk of death in the event of a heart attack or stroke. 
Alcohol and drug use, abuse, and dependence. 
Long-term disability, resulting in lost wages and financial struggle. 
Strained relationships with family and friends. 
Suicidal thoughts and/or attempts. 
If you are seriously thinking about harming yourself, please call the National Suicide Prevention hotline (1-800-273-8255) right now. 
The good news is that you don't have to live with depression, a condition that is entirely treatable. More than 80% of people with depression benefit from treatment and can live fulfilling, productive lives. You should work closely with your health care provider to come up with the best treatment plan for you. These plans usually involve some combination of psychotherapy, medication, lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), and alternative therapies like yoga, meditation, herbal supplements, and visualization., Attention Disorders Can Take a Toll on Marriage

"You can't expect a child with this disorder to apply what's learned in one situation to another; you have to keep teaching the same lessons until your child learns them." Because of this, discipline can sometimes feel futile. However, there are helpful methods to use with children who have ADHD. For example, fight the urge to discipline your child constantly, and save stronger punishments for truly abominable behavior. Avoid yelling, spanking, or losing your temper ‚Äî it's better to remove your child firmly from a disruptive situation and give him or her a time-out. Many experts also suggest using a points or token system with rewards and penalties. Emphasizing good behavior and rewarding the completion of simple tasks have been shown to help modify the behavior of children with ADHD., 12 Ways to Help Your Child Cope With ADHD

Practical steps that can help improve day-to-day behavior
ADHD Center

Small Changes Help Kids With ADHD 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition that becomes apparent in some children in the preschool and early school years. It is hard for these children to control their behavior or pay attention. It is estimated that between 3 and 5 percent of children have ADHD, or approximately 2 million children in the United States. 

Children with ADHD frequently need help with organizing and planning their day. Theses few simple steps can go a long way toward improving behavior: 

Schedule 
Have the same routine every day, from wake-up time to bedtime. The schedule should include homework time, playtime, outdoor recreation, and indoor activities such as computer games. Have the schedule on the refrigerator or a bulletin board in the kitchen. If a schedule change must be made, make it as far in advance as possible. 

Organize 
Put the child's commonly used items in order. Have a place for everything and keep everything in its place. This includes clothing, backpacks, and school supplies. Use homework and notebook organizers. Stress the importance of writing down assignments and bringing home needed books. 

Set Rules 
Children with ADHD need consistent rules that they can understand and follow. If rules are followed, give small rewards. Children with ADHD often receive, and expect, criticism. Look for good behavior and praise it., How Food Can Affect Your Child's ADHD

Perfectionism is another productivity-zapper for people with ADHD. Knowing a project‚Äôs requirements helps you gauge how much effort to put into it. Maynard recommends doing ‚Äúonly what is asked for on small or un-important projects. Save ‚Äògoing all out‚Äô for important projects that will get you a raise, a promotion, or get you noticed in the big scheme of things.‚Äù 

10.Under-promise and over-deliver. It‚Äôs common for individuals with ADHD to underestimate how long it‚Äôll take to finish a project, Maynard said. Usually, it takes twice as long as you originally planned. 

11.Regulate interruptions. You can spend all day on e-mail, phone calls and the Internet. Plus, ‚Äúan interruption or reminder that there is something else you need to complete will take you away from the task at hand,‚Äù Rolands said. To stop these distractions from shredding your productivity, check e-mail and return calls several times a day, Maynard said. With the Internet, ‚Äúdefine exactly what you need before you start surfing so if you find other interesting information, you can remind yourself that that is not what you are looking for,‚Äù she said. Don‚Äôt hesitate to shoo people away from your cubicle, close the door to your office or find a quiet place to read, Maynard said. 

12.Enlist a productivity partner. Support helps tremendously with productivity, and it can come in various forms. For example, if Rolands‚Äôs clients commit to plan their day for 15 minutes, they e-mail her once they‚Äôre finished to tell her they‚Äôve completed their planning. ‚ÄúThis helps them to stay on track and not forget about planning in the time between coaching sessions,‚Äù she said. Friends or colleagues also can be productivity partners and keep you accountable. Rolands said that individuals with ADHD can help each other, too., 6.Organize smarter. Consider what you need to organize to make the biggest difference on your efficiency, Maynard said. ‚ÄúOrganizing the most important part of the office first can jump-start you working smarter not harder.‚Äù She gave these examples: ‚ÄúIs it my files on my computer? Is it my reference material on the bookshelf? Is it my planner? Is it my purse, my briefcase, my ‚Äòto do‚Äô notebook?‚Äù 

7.Be super-selective when de-cluttering. According to Maynard, ‚ÄúClutter and disorganization can be a hindrance to productivity if you are losing or wasting time looking for things.‚Äù Instead of asking, ‚Äú‚ÄôWhat can I use this for?‚Äô ‚Äî which is dangerous as an ADDer can think of a million uses for almost anything ‚Äî ask, ‚ÄòHow can I do without this?‚Äô Can the information be retrieved elsewhere?‚Äô‚Äù 

8.Avoid multi-tasking. If something is very familiar to you, doing two tasks at once isn‚Äôt a big deal. If a task is unfamiliar and complex, though, give it your full attention, Maynard said. For instance, drinking coffee while learning how to drive is dangerous, but after you become a skilled driver, you can do this safely, she said., 3.Make time to plan. Carving out some time each day to plan provides maximum focus and productivity, according to Rolands. She recommended setting aside 10 to 15 minutes per day for planning. 

4.Time your tasks. Using a timer or alarm helps in several ways, according to Rolands. ‚ÄúFirst, if someone is procrastinating on a task, setting a timer and just working on that task for a set amount of time can help them make progress and ensure that it will not be too painful to work on that particular task.‚Äù Once the timer dings, you can move on to your next task. ‚ÄúSecond, if working on an enjoyable task, it can be helpful to set a timer so that the whole day is not spent on that one activity,‚Äù she said. You can use a timer for any task, whether that‚Äôs working on a project for your job, running errands or doing household chores. 

5.Start small. To avoid getting overwhelmed with new ideas and tasks, take smalls steps, Rolands said. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre trying to incorporate planning into your routine. Each day, spend 10 minutes on planning for three weeks. After you cement this habit, add more time to your planning routine or work on a new activity., ADHD & Productivity: 12 Strategies for Getting Things Done
By Margarita Tartakovsky, M.S. 

For someone with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), completing a task can be fraught with challenges. Distractions such as e-mail, Internet, TV and other tasks abound. People with ADHD often face a special challenge in remaining productive, especially in distraction-driven environments (such as the office or even a classroom).

To get a handle on distractions and boost your productivity, here are 12 useful strategies for accomplishing what you need.

1.Employ the two-minute rule. Procrastination is a big barrier to productivity for individuals with ADHD, and leads to all-nighters and missed deadlines, according to Sandy Maynard, M.S., who operates Catalytic Coaching and specializes in ADHD coaching. ‚ÄúEntering a phone number into a database right away can save lots of time later looking for it or figuring out what a single number on a scrap of paper with no name goes to,‚Äù Maynard said.

2.Pick a planner that works for you. Structure is essential for someone with ADHD. Without it, ‚Äúit can be hard to achieve top productivity,‚Äù said Laura Rolands, M.S., an attention and ADHD coach who operates LSR Coaching and Consulting. However, ‚Äúplanning and maintaining a calendar, which are examples of structure, can feel constricting and uninteresting,‚Äù she said. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to pick a planner that fits your personal needs, and one that you‚Äôll actually use. Rolands wrote a valuable how-to on picking the best planner for you., When Anxiety Leads to Panic Disorder

Medically reviewed by Ed Zimney, MD

Q: My son is almost 9, and he has ADHD. He is taking Adderall XR 25 mg. Does Adderall or ADHD have anything to do with forgetfulness? My son seems to forget a lot. Is there a test or something I can do to help him remember and to know what‚Äôs going on with him? 
 
A:  
Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) does not cause forgetfulness. By its nature, ADHD leads to forgetfulness. People with ADHD have problems doing what they know in a consistent, predictable, independent manner. They often miss the cues in the environment necessary to shift or adjust their behavior. This leads them to forget things, things they know they should do. We now understand that the biggest problem for people with ADHD is not so much an inability to pay attention but an inconsistency in paying attention, which leads one to forget. 

However, we also know that some children and adults actually experience memory problems that may make them appear inattentive. So when parents are concerned about forgetfulness, my recommendation is for the child to undergo a thorough neuropsychological evaluation to make certain that problems with memory are not masquerading as ADHD.

Nov. 25, 2011, 6:33 a.m. EST
The Reporter
We are a family of some ADHD members looking for more structured consequences to help end the conflict at home.

The challenge of raising children with ADHD often extends into the family. The presence of multiple family members with ADHD and/ or non-ADHD siblings complicate and frustrate parents' attempts to keep the peace. Impulse control problems fuel chronic name calling, corrosive and senseless competition, persistent provocation, and deliberate aggression, eroding the fabric of family life. Parents face the sometimes daily barrage of siblings baiting and blaming one another while marital happiness is strained by the burden of figuring out the best response to the problems of the day.

If ADHD creates too much conflict in family life read these tips to impose structure through a consequence- based plan:

Both parents construct a coaching plan that details family rules and consequences to infractions. List the rules on paper. Rules are to be realistic and clear, such as "No threats to hurt one another." Talk separately with each child to review the rules and request feedback and additions to the list. Ensure that the rules encompass parental behavior if circumstances warrant. For example, "No family members are to use profanity." Summon all family members to discuss the list and categorize each rule violation in one of three categories: mild, medium, serious. Request input from the kids with the understanding that parents have final say.

Once the list is complete parents meet separately to agree upon a continuum of consequences tied to the three tiers of violations. A mild violation could warrant a thirty minute time-out, a medium infraction might receive a two hour grounding from inside and outside privileges, and a serious one could receive a two day grounding . In circumstances where more than one child is at fault parents are use their best judgment as to which infraction level is appropriate to each child's contribution. Consider including the option of "mature processing of the event with my parents and/or sibling" as a way of reducing consequence time. This would entail a thoughtful discussion where children recognize problem triggers, accept constructive feedback, and offer a sincere apology.

Meet separately with each child to discuss the three consequence levels and where their typical misbehaviors would land them. For the child with ADHD, stress how certain times of the day, such as early morning and before bedtime, and circumstances, such as hunger and fatigue, place them at greater risk to break rules and suffer consequences. Explain how their reacting side is more easily triggered by siblings during these times, and the importance of being more watchful and ready to "walk away, look away, or move away" from siblings if that happens. If misbehaviors are triggered by parental requests explain that a mutually agreed upon "advance readiness plan" can help them prepare to comply so that their thinking side is not seized by the reacting side. Parents should also meet separately with the non-ADHD child to address their typical contributions to the cycle of conflict. Remind them of the greater impulse control they have at their disposal and the importance of not taking advantage of their sibling's reactive nature.

While some people believe that chemicals in food coloring or preservatives can make ADHD worse, no studies substantiate the claim. But diet can affect mood and behavior, Tuckman says. "People feel better when they eat a healthy diet," he says. "And you should avoid foods you have a negative reaction to."

Exercise can also be helpful. Olympian Michael Phelps and his mother, Debbie, have been open about his ADHD and how swimming helped him manage his condition. Studies show that, in children at least, exercise can help control the symptoms of ADHD. 

Living With ADHD 

For those who've gone untreated their whole lives, beginning to understand that they can make adjustments and changes to improve their quality of life is a huge step.

"Surround yourself with people who will hold you accountable, keep you focused, and offer encouragement," Martin says. "Being open and honest, establishing clear boundaries and routines, and working with a team ‚Äî therapist, coach, mentor ‚Äî are all helpful."

Medication is the first step in treating adult ADHD but not the only one; the condition requires a whole-life approach, says Tuckman. "It's the medication that sets people up, but education, coaching, and therapy enable people with adult ADHD to really take it all the way.", ADHD at Home 

People with adult ADHD tend to crave new experiences and often act impulsively, according to Dr. Lara Honos-Webb, a clinical psychologist in San Francisco and author of The Gift of Adult ADD. Dr. Honos-Webb says it's important for those with adult ADHD to explain their behavior to their partners and for couples to work together. 

For example, if you have ADHD and tend to tune out when your partner is talking, Honos-Webb suggests focusing on the conversation for five minutes, then verbally summarizing what you heard your partner say. "This strategy can really help a partner because you're showing them you've listened," she says. 

ADHD and Coaching 

To become more productive at home and at work, people with adult ADHD can work with an ADHD coach to learn organizational skills and time-management strategies, says Tuckman. "Someone with adult ADHD will say, 'I'm going to spend two hours working on this report,' but then the phone rings and some e-mails come in and a half hour goes by," Tuckman says. "A coach can help you implement strategies to manage your ADHD.", Life Management Skills for Adult ADHD

By Alyson McNutt English

From forgetting to pay bills on time to missing dates with friends, the consequences of unmanaged attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be life-altering. But how can an adult who struggles with attention-deficit difficulties move past these roadblocks to enjoy a fuller, less anxiety ridden life? 

ADHD at the Office 

Creating to-do lists with deadlines can be a big help to people with ADHD, says Kirk Martin, executive director of Celebrate!ADHD, an organization that coaches schools, families, and companies on ways to productively address the social and behavioral differences in those with ADD and ADHD.

And while it may seem counterintuitive, Martin says controlled external "distractions" can actually help those with adult ADHD concentrate better. "The brain of an adult with ADHD works better when stimulated," he says. "Moving, chewing, listening to music, and other activities can help the brain focus and work smarter."

People with adult ADHD are messy by nature, says Dr. Ari Tuckman, a clinical psychologist and ADHD specialist in West Chester, Pennsylvania. This not only looks bad but also can affect productivity. "Create a system you can stick with that will help you reduce clutter so you can find things when you need them," he says....., Depression can lead you to do the unthinkable:

, Although fewer females are diagnosed with ADD/ADHD than males, women with this disorder face special problems. - By Gina Roberts-Grey

Ari Tuckman, PsyD, a clinical psychologist in West Chester, Pennsylvania, says this disparity may be due to a public misconception: Even though ADHD affects both males and females, many people think it occurs mostly in boys and men. Therefore, fewer women than men seek help for ADD/ADHD symptoms, and doctors are less likely to suspect that female patients have the disorder. The resulting missed diagnoses increase the chances that a woman with ADHD may develop one or more of the related conditions listed below. 

Anxiety and depression. "Females are often initially diagnosed with anxiety or depression instead of ADHD," Dr. Tuckman says. Although women may indeed have anxiety and depression, research has found that ADD/ADHD may be at the root of many of these problems. "Women's ADHD symptoms contribute to their becoming anxious and depressed," Tuckman notes. "And, if the correct diagnosis of ADHD is missed, they only partially benefit from treatment for the anxiety and depression." 

Obesity and eating disorders.Research has linked women with ADHD to an increased chance of being overweight or having an eating disorder. "This makes sense, since organization and concentration are required to eat a healthy diet and work out regularly," says Tuckman." By contrast, scattered women with ADHD are more likely to grab quick meals, overeat, or look to food to provide comfort from their ADHD symptoms." 

Addictions. Some research has found women with ADHD to be at risk for drug or alcohol abuse or other harmful addictions. "Habit-forming, impulse-related behaviors, such as gambling or shopping addictions, also often have a strong association with ADHD," says Tuckman. 

Getting Help for ADHD 

If you suspect that your ADHD is leading you down a harmful path, Tuckman suggests consulting a therapist, psychiatrist, and/or life coach. "Just make sure to consult someone who has experience treating adult ADHD and the unique issues faced by women with ADHD," he notes. The right therapist can devise an ADHD-specific cognitive-behavioral treatment plan that focuses on such issues as self-esteem, interpersonal and family problems, daily health habits, stress levels, and life-management skills. "This type of treatment combines therapy that focuses on psychological issues of ADHD, like self-esteem and self-blame, with rehabilitative tools that guide women away from destructive behaviors like overeating or alcohol abuse," Tuckman adds. 

Joining a support group for women with ADHD is also helpful. "Talking with women who know firsthand how impulses can affect your life is a healthy outlet for frustration," says Tuckman. The National Center for Gender Issues and ADD(ADHD) has several links to resources available for women with ADHD., Poor sleep can often be traced back to an unexpected source. Learn about 10 pitfalls that cause poor sleep or insomnia. 
http://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep-pictures/common-sleep-thieves.aspx#/slide-1, Make Cherry Juice Your Nightcap:
Alcohol is a known sleep saboteur ‚Äî it may make you fall asleep, but it disrupts normal sleep cycles, causing you to wake up in the middle of the night. Cherry juice, on the other hand, may help ensure restful slumber, because it‚Äôs naturally high in melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate your body‚Äôs sleep-wake cycles. In a 2010 study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food, participants who drank tart cherry juice twice a day fell asleep sooner than when they drank a placebo beverage.

Don't Turn In Too Early:
Even if you‚Äôre exhausted, try to stick to within 30 minutes of your normal bedtime. Going to bed hours earlier than usual may throw your body‚Äôs normal rhythm out of whack, says Dr. Emsellem. ‚ÄúSticking to a routine is key to keeping insomnia at bay. While you may hate being locked into a schedule, your brain likes following a pattern.‚Äù Likewise, daytime napping, even if you slept poorly the night before, is also a no-no if you‚Äôre prone to insomnia.

Avoid Weekend Sleep-Ins:
It may sound logical, but you can‚Äôt compensate for weekday sleep debt by sleeping in on the weekends, Penn State College of Medicine researchers recently found. Don‚Äôt rely on weekends as a sleep safety net, but pick a more reasonable weekday bedtime to stick to. Nudge your bedtime back 15 minutes at a time to help you adjust. If you normally hit the hay at 11:30, for example, go to bed at 11:15 for a few nights, then 11, then 10:45 ‚Äî until you reach your ideal bedtime, which for most people is about 7 to 8 hours before you need to wake up.

Keep Your Cool:
Research shows that the optimal room temperature for sleep is between 60 to 68 degrees. In one recent study, University of Pittsburgh researchers found that when insomniacs wore a special cap designed to lower body temperature, they fell asleep about as quickly as other study participants without sleep issues. Why this works: The cooling cap helped reduce brain metabolic activity, setting in motion a normal sleep cycle. Although the cap isn‚Äôt ready for primetime, keeping your bedroom cool and wearing breathable clothing (or even nothing at all!) can help welcome the sandman., Try Some Gentle Yoga:
Practice 15 minutes of simple, yoga-like poses (such as neck rolls, shoulder rolls, and arm and back stretches) to help your muscles unwind before hitting the sheets, says Helene A. Emsellem, MD, director of The Center for Sleep & Wake Disorders in Chevy Chase, Md. But go slowly. ‚ÄúThe goal is to loosen your muscles to prepare your body for a good night‚Äôs sleep, not increase your heart rate,‚Äù she explains.

Sweat Your Way Sleepy:
A 2010 Northwestern University study of women age 55 and older with insomnia found that regular aerobic exercise in particular has the ability to improve sleep quality, mood, and energy. In the study, one group did aerobic exercise a few times a week while the other did recreational activities like attending cooking classes or museum lectures. After four months, the exercisers reported an improvement in sleep quality, fewer depression symptoms, more energy, and less daytime sleepiness. The sleep effect may be pegged to endorphins, which are released during aerobic exercise and may promote better sleep quantity and quality, says Breus.

But Work Out in the A.m.
Exercising in the morning can help you sleep better than working out in the afternoon or evening, In a small recent study, researchers at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., found that people spent 85 percent more time in light sleep and 75 percent more time in deep sleep when they worked out at 7 a.m. compared to later in the day. The study authors aren‚Äôt exactly sure why, but believe early-bird workouts decrease levels of stress hormones, which peak in the morning, and this leads to better sleep quality later on., Relax In a Rocking Chair:
It‚Äôs well known that babies fall fast asleep when they‚Äôre rocked gently back and forth in a carriage or a mother‚Äôs arms. Surprisingly, the same trick works with adults, say Swiss researchers. When study participants napped in a hammock-like bed, they fell asleep faster and entered the restorative deep-sleep phase sooner than when they slept in a regular bed. It seems that the gentle swinging sensation primes areas of the brain involved in deep sleep. While you can‚Äôt exactly doze off in a hammock every night, try chilling out in a rocking chair before hitting the sheets to mimic the motion and help your body feel sleepy.

Power Down an Hour Before Bed:
‚ÄúSleep is not an on-and-off switch,‚Äù says sleep expert and clinical psychologist Michael Breus, PhD, author of The Sleep Doctor‚Äôs Diet Plan. ‚ÄúYour body needs time to unwind and ready itself for shuteye.‚Äù That‚Äôs why Dr. Breus recommends practicing a three-part routine called the ‚ÄúPower-Down Hour.‚Äù During the first 20 minutes, complete any chores that absolutely must get done before bedtime. Wash your face, brush your teeth, and get dressed for bed during the next 20 minutes. For the last 20 minutes, lie in bed quietly and meditate. Focus on the rhythm of your breathing and shoo away any negative thoughts during this time.

Count Sheep‚Ä¶ Backward:
If your mind tends to race as soon as your head hits the pillow, put the brakes on this sleep-stealing habit by distracting yourself from rehashing the day‚Äôs events. One tip Breus offers his patients: Count down from 300 in multiples of three. ‚ÄúBecause this task is mathematically complicated to do in your head,‚Äù he explains, ‚Äúit forces your brain to focus on something else besides your worries.‚Äù, Although some medications and health issues (such as depression) can cause insomnia, the most common factors are anxiety, stress, and diet. If you‚Äôre a frequent insomnia victim, you‚Äôve probably already tried the basics, like cutting back on caffeine and alcohol or banishing the TV from the bedroom. Maybe you‚Äôve also turned to the medications, luxury mattresses and pillows, white noise machines, and other remedies that comprise the $23 billion a year Americans spend on sleep aids, according to a 2008 report.

But there are other solutions, say sleep experts. In fact, the latest sleep science reveals a host of low-cost remedies that can help prevent insomnia and reintroduce you to the sandman. Surely, one or two will work for you...., Will you toss and turn before you fall asleep tonight? Then try one of these simple strategies now to claim a good night's rest. (Hint: Don't read this article too close to bed!) - By Amy Capetta

On a rare night when you actually crawl into bed at a decent hour, you stare at the ceiling, eyes wide open, mind racing ‚Ä¶ and a good night‚Äôs sleep feels more like a distant dream with every passing second. You‚Äôre not alone. Every year, as many as 40 percent of adults have insomnia, an inability to fall or stay asleep, according to the National Sleep Foundation. About 10 to 15 percent of people suffer from chronic insomnia, finding it difficult to get enough shuteye at least a few nights a week.

Sad story...........having facebook at that age is unacceptable.  Way to much going on for kids these days.  Parents need to spend more time talking to their children and REALLY listening to what their children have to say., Stress doesn't just rattle your nerves and put you on edge. The effects of stress can include forgetfulness, sexual problems, insomnia, and hair loss......

Sexual Problems Due to Stress:
The effects of stress can extend to the bedroom. While most men may experience erectile dysfunction from time to time, when it happens frequently, its underlying cause should be investigated. Causes of erectile dysfunction can include diabetes, high blood pressure, side effects of certain medications, and chronic stress. Stress can also contribute to a loss of sexual desire in both men and women. 

Concentration and Stress:
Bad news for stressed-out students cramming for exams ‚Äî it turns out that being under pressure can affect how well our brains work. Specifically, one small study showed that medical students studying for board exams had more trouble focusing their attention than others who were not stressed. The good news? A month after the stressful period was over, the stressed group‚Äôs mental skills returned to normal. 

Insomnia and Stress:
Few things are as frustrating as lying awake in bed, unable to sleep. While insomnia can stem from a variety of sources, one to consider is stress. Stress can cause a number of sleep-related issues including trouble falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and poor-quality sleep. Try to get stress relief through regular exercise, enjoyable hobbies, and spending time with loved ones., Skin Problems From Stress:
According to the American Academy of Dermatology, our internal thoughts and feelings can actually affect our external appearance. This is particularly true when it comes to stress. One of the effects of stress is skin that‚Äôs more sensitive to irritants. Stress can worsen pre-existing conditions including rosacea, psoriasis, and acne, as well as dehydrate the skin, permitting allergens, bacteria, and pollutants to irritate it. 

Substance Abuse and Stress:
For individuals struggling with alcohol or drugs, stress can wreak havoc on efforts to remain substance-free. Even for people who have abstained for a long time, stress can play a significant role in contributing to a relapse. Interestingly, not only can stress in adulthood contribute to substance abuse, but experiencing a severe psychosocial stressor during childhood can also increase your risk for drug or alcohol abuse as an adult. 

Stress and Reduced Immunity:
Excessive stress and anxiety can lead to reduced immunity and an increased chance of getting sick. This link between stress and the body‚Äôs ability to fight disease may go all the way back to childhood. Researchers have found that adolescents who were abused or experienced other, intensely stressful situations as children were less able to ward off certain infections even years later. It‚Äôs crucial to keep daily stress under control as much as possible to offset the effects of past stress and encourage good health in the present., Stress-Induced Hair Loss:
Some amount of hair loss is normal ‚Äî strands fall out over time and get replaced by new ones. However, when you‚Äôre under physical or emotional stress the normal shedding of 100 or so hairs a day can speed up to the point where half to three-quarters of your hair can fall out. Known as telogen effluvium, this diffuse and often stress-induced hair loss may not happen right away. In fact, it may take weeks or months after the stressful event for the hair to actually shed. Fortunately, after six to eight months this type of hair loss often improves. 

Forgetfulness Due to Stress:
We all have our moments of not being able to find our car keys, but research shows that the more stress we are under, the more frequent these mental lapses may become. In fact, not only can long-term stress (over a period of weeks or months) disrupt communication between brain cells, but even several hours of acute stress can affect the brain‚Äôs ability to store information and create solid memories. For many people, frequent bouts of forgetfulness can lead to fears about Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. But before jumping to conclusions, take a step back and consider whether any chronic stress in your life may be playing a role in memory issues. 

Stress and Dental Health:
Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups ‚Äî most of us are well-versed in what it takes to keep our teeth healthy. But how many of us realize that the effects of stress can impact dental health? During the day and even while sleeping, people under stress may clench their teeth or grind them back and forth against one another. This action, called bruxism, can not only wear down and damage your teeth, but may also cause temporomandibular joint problems (TMJ), leading to severe jaw and neck pain., Stress Takes a Toll on Your Body and Mind -9 Scary Symptoms of Stress
By Kristen Stewart

When most of us think of the physical effects of stress, our minds jump to common complaints like headaches and upset stomachs. Stress, however, can affect many aspects of physical and mental health, ranging from hair, teeth, and skin to memory and concentration skills, and even how well we sleep. The good news is while these problems may seem serious, stress relief can lead to real improvements in your overall health and well-being., How a kid with Asperger's Syndrome views the world

http://online4.fiu.edu/SA3/Flash/Telan/CLP4134/Autism_Diagnosis_in_Children/Autism_Diagnosis_in_Children.html, Prepare for Emergencies:
Douglas Cootey, a blogger with ADHD, says he carries a boredom survival kit jam-packed with items like a notepad and pens, an iPod, a handheld video game, books or magazines, and other things he can focus on when a dull moment strikes. Just knowing he has options calms his anxiety., Break It Up:
Are you dreading a painfully tedious task or project? Try rewarding yourself with mini-breaks as you march toward your goal. It may take longer to complete the task if you take lots of breaks, but in the end, you‚Äôll get it done in less time than you would have spent procrastinating, Take an Alternate Route:
For many, nothing challenges the limits of ADHD like being stuck in bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic. But rather than give in to the anger and turn to road rage, you may consider taking side streets or choosing a less direct but less busy route to save your sanity., Set Yourself Up:
Before you head into a meeting or other situation that requires your undivided attention, set yourself up for success by thinking ahead and eliminating things that may keep you from staying focused, says Tara McGillicuddy, an ADHD coach and woman with ADHD. Eat, go to the bathroom, and gather the documents you‚Äôll need before the meeting starts. This way, you won‚Äôt find yourself focused on your rumbling stomach, ready-to-burst bladder, or the file you forgot., Don't Sweat the Small Stuff:
When you can‚Äôt change the situation, try turning to a trusted mantra ‚Äî ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sweat the small stuff‚Äù ‚Äî to change your attitude. That way, when you‚Äôre standing behind a particularly agitated person, for example, you can avoid focusing on negative feelings and refocus on the positive., Fiddle With It:
Carry a smooth stone in your pocket that you can fiddle with when boredom strikes. The repeated movement of flipping the stone over and over in your fingers, for example, can help keep you focused but isn‚Äôt so distracting or obvious that it draws attention. A coin, a piece of jewelry, silly putty, or some other small item that's easily carried can serve the same purpose., Keep Your Mind Busy:
When you find yourself stuck in a line, instead of focusing on your frustration (which will just make you more annoyed), try playing some mind games with yourself. Count how many people are wearing yellow and how many blue, make up mental stories about the lives of those around you, or just do some people watching. You‚Äôll keep your mind entertained and off the subject of how much you wish you could just push your way to the front of the line., Play, Don't Pick:
One man with ADHD admits that he began picking fights with his spouse when his patience was being tested by other matters, just to create the stimulation he needed to stay alert. While arguing with his wife may have distracted him from his boredom, it‚Äôs not a very good exercise for your relationship. His suggestion? Come up with a code word to clue your spouse in when you‚Äôre feeling impatient, and have some go-to solutions ready to choose from. For instance, how about initiating an engaging game of cards or Scrabble instead of a needless battle, in which you both lose?, Get Involved:
When you find yourself on the receiving end of a less-than-engaging presentation at work, try occasionally raising your hand and asking questions if the setting is appropriate, suggests ADHD blogger Peter. Just be careful not to dominate the conversation or interrupt too much. No chance to ask questions? You can still keep your mind occupied and engaged by writing down your response to what is being said or questions to ask at a later point, he suggests., Take Note:
While you may wish you never had to wait, the reality is that you can pretty much plan on it being part of your daily life. Carry a pocket notebook and pen with you to jot down a list, brainstorm an idea, or even doodle or sketch so you can avoid feeling that downtime is lost time., Whether or not it's because of ADHD, everyone gets caught up in frustrating delays and tedious situations.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080407160751.htm, For Men with ADHD Who Aren't Convinced it Matters | ADHD and Marriage
http://www.adhdmarriage.com/content/men-adhd-who-arent-convinced-it-matters, Often, our bad eating patterns are related to our particular environment. To make changes in your own eating patterns, you may need to make changes in the environment - both at home and at work.

Coworkers with bad eating habits

One woman with ADD (ADHD) reported that she worked in a group that was very food-oriented. Many of her co-workers were obese and often brought delicious, fattening food to work to share with the group - platters of brownies, homemade cookies, or bagels and cream cheese picked up on the way to work. While she wasn't successful in changing the eating habits of her group of co-workers, she was able to change her habit of eating in the staff lounge on days when such foods were on display. She was successful in her request that such food not be on display at meetings that she was required to attend.

Work environments with no healthy food choices.

A young man with ADD (ADHD) reported that he survived on junk food during the day at work. Although he worked for an organization that stressed healthful living and outdoor activities, ironically the only food or drink available in vending machines was sugar-laden sodas, and vending-machine junk-food snacks. His disorganization and lack of planning, along with the junk-food availability on the job were a dangerous combination.

Most likely the contradiction between his company's philosophy and the vending machine products available to employees had never been noticed. After speaking to his ADD (ADHD) counselor, he decided to be pro-active. He asked for healthy snacks and drinks such as apple juice, V-8, and bottled water; low-sugar protein bars, nuts, and dried fruits to be made available in the vending machines in the staff lounge. To his pleasure and surprise, several co-workers thanked him for initiating the change.

Family members who insist on tempting, unhealthy food

Some people with ADD (ADHD) who try to improve their eating patterns feel sabotaged by family members who insist upon keeping desserts and snack foods in the house. While you can't insist that the entire family live according to your new eating plans, it's important to talk about your needs with your partner and children. Everyone will benefit from a healthier diet with fewer processed snack foods and less sugar. Try making gradual changes - for example having only one or two sweets or snacks in the house. And try to problem-solve by purchasing snacks or desserts that are not your favorites but still appeal to the snackers in your family. It's also reasonable to request that tempting foods be kept in places where you're not likely to see them each time you open the refrigerator or pantry.

Identify your problematic daily eating patterns - then problem-solve

Assess your own daily eating patterns. Most likely you will identify one, two, or three likely places and circumstances in which you are more likely to overeat or to eat food items you would rather avoid. Once these circumstances are identified, then you can begin to problem-solve.

No "good-for-you" food around

This calls for some problem-solving. Make a list of foods that you want to include in your new, healthier eating plan - choose those that can be kept in the freezer or that have a long shelf-life in the pantry. That way, there's always something healthy to eat and to need to grab the chips.

Too hungry to wait

Many people with ADD (ADHD) don't pay enough attention to their hunger levels. They may become busy during the day, eating very little, and then discover that they're ravenous - resorting to fast food or high-calorie snacks because it's too hard to wait and eating something healthy.

Skip meals, then binge

Fasting and binging is another common ADD (ADHD) pattern - sort of an all or nothing approach to food. Many people mistakenly believe that it's good to skip a meal, not realizing that they are setting themselves up to overeat at the next meal.

Success strategies for developing healthy eating patterns:

Look for strategies that make it easy to succeed and harder to fail -

don't put temptation in your path and then expect to control your impulses (for example a bowl of candy on your desk)

always keep healthy snacks around for times when hunger strikes

don't require too much planning and organization of yourself - make sure there are healthy grab-and-go food items for times when the unexpected happens

Weight management resources for adults with ADHD:

Fleming, John (2002) Eating disorders in women with ADHD. In P.Quinn & K. Nadeau, Gender Issues and ADHD, pp. 411-426. Silver Spring: Advantage Books., Many with ADD (ADHD) want "instant results" and are drawn to the most strict and radical diet plan promising a weight loss of several pounds per week. Statistics show that such plans are doomed to failure for the general population, and are even less likely to result in long-term success for those with ADD (ADHD).

Develop an ADD-friendly Eating Plan

A plan is more likely to succeed for people with ADD (ADHD) if it does not require careful daily planning and packing of food. An adult with ADD (ADHD) often begins a new eating plan with determination, carefully preparing a bag lunch to take to work each day. Such a plan, however, is nearly doomed to fail. As soon as stress levels rise, or the individual wakes up late, the day's lunch isn't packed and an immediate reversion to fast food or junk food occurs.

An eating plan that doesn't require 100% success is more likely to succeed. An ADD (ADHD)-friendly plan makes allowances for common ADD (ADHD) patterns such as forgetfulness or lateness with a "Plan B." Plan B involves keeping foods with a longer shelf-live in stock at the office for days of lateness, forgetfulness or high stress. These staples should not be sweets or tempting salty snacks, but rather things such as protein bars, sunflower seeds, dried fruit, yogurt (which can last for weeks when refrigerated), unsalted nuts, and refrigerated fresh fruit - a bag of apples or oranges. If you are fortunate enough to have a freezer available at the office, your Plan B could also involve containers of frozen left-overs from home that you can pop in the microwave or frozen protein drinks that can be thawed. These foods can be restocked every couple of weeks so that there's no need to revert to your old high-calorie lunch habits on days you don't pack a lunch.

Changing Your Food Environment

Don't feel you must "go along with the crowd" in your eating habits - remember, "the crowd" used to smoke!

Unhealthy eating patterns are only now beginning to be seen as a significant public health problem that affects those around you as well as yourself. Twenty or more years ago, people quietly suffered while others smoked cigarettes during meetings and at meals. Today, many people who are working hard to develop healthy eating patterns don't feel as comfortable asking people not to share brownies, although they would feel very comfortable asking them not to share second-hand smoke. A person with ADD (ADHD)-related impulsivity shouldn't expect himself to maintain self-control while sitting in front of tempting, but unhealthy food. Instead, we need the confidence to speak up and request that we are not required to expose ourselves to unwanted temptation through the "good intentions" of coworkers.

con't....., ADD (ADHD) and Disordered Eating

The ADD (ADHD)/disordered eating connection is not difficult to understand. Healthy dietary regulation requires organization and planning - two areas of cognitive functioning that are typically difficult for those with ADD (ADHD). Good eating habits also require self-awareness - awareness of when one is hungry, awareness of when one is full. Many individuals with ADD (ADHD) report that they skip meals because they were busy and distracted; these same individuals often report that later their hunger becomes so intense that they swing in the opposite direction, overeating well beyond the point of reasonable intake because they don't know when to stop until they feel "stuffed." And individuals eat for many reasons besides hunger - including boredom, self-stimulation, anger, sadness, reward, simple food availability, and stress relief. It is easy to understand how consistent self-regulation, which is a well-documented difficulty for those with ADD (ADHD), can lead to patterns of chronic over-eating.

Why most diet plans don't work for those with ADHD

Many diet plans are very ADD-unfriendly. They require detailed record-keeping, weighing of food, or unrealistically severe food restrictions are difficult for those without ADD (ADHD) and impossible for those with ADD (ADHD). Other weight loss programs involve pre-selected, pre-packaged foods that may work well in the short-run, but that do not help the individual with ADD (ADHD) to learn to make consistently good choices in real-world food environments.

What to do if you are an adult with ADD (ADHD) and weight control issues

Stimulant medication

Dr. Fleming writes that the use of stimulant medication alone has not been shown to be effective in achieving and maintaining weight loss and improved daily eating patterns. Although appetite suppression is a common side effect of stimulant medication during the initial phase of treatment, this side effect wears off. He emphasizes that stimulants should never be prescribed for their side effect of appetite suppression, but notes that stimulant medication can be a very useful part of an overall weight-loss treatment program for those with ADD (ADHD).

The primary benefit of stimulant medication in healthy dietary management is its enhancement of the executive functions of the brain. In other words, stimulants can help individuals with ADHD to become better self-observers; to become more consistent in their ability to self-regulate and resist eating impulses; and to more easily engage in the planning and follow-through necessary for the maintenance of healthy eating habits.

Don't go on a "diet."

con't......., Many adults go for years not knowing they have ADHD. They assume, as many people do, that ADHD is a "kid's" disorder. When they finally learn that they do have ADHD‚Äîa medically recognized disorder in adults‚Äîthey often experience an "a-ha!" moment, feeling relieved to understand the source of their concerns. Sometimes it's not until a child is diagnosed with ADHD that the parent realizes personal symptoms of ADHD as well.

ADHD tends to run in families. So, when one family member is diagnosed, you may want to look for symptoms of ADHD in other immediate family members.

Abuse of cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs unfortunately seems to be linked to ADHD in adolescents and teens. One recent Harvard Medical School study, which followed 268 kids diagnosed with ADHD for a decade, found that nearly one-third developed a substance abuse problem over the course of the study ‚Äî a 50 percent greater risk than in kids without ADHD. The good news is that other research has found that successful treatment of adolescents with ADHD reduces their likelihood of substance abuse.

Another factor to consider, per the new AAP guidelines: Some tweens and teens who present with ADHD symptoms for the first time may actually have substance abuse problems instead. In fact, some may even fake ADHD symptoms to get prescriptions for stimulant medication that‚Äôs typically prescribed to treat ADHD. The AAP recommends that doctors assess adolescents who are newly diagnosed with ADHD for signs of drug and alcohol use before attempting to treat ADHD symptoms., Learning Disabilities
While ADHD isn‚Äôt technically considered a learning disability, about 20 to 30 percent of kids with ADHD have such common learning difficulties as dyslexia. And the hallmark traits of ADHD, including difficulty concentrating and impulsivity, can contribute to behavioral issues in the classroom and challenges with homework and test taking. If a child has a specific learning disability, it needs to be distinguished from the behavioral and attention aspects of ADHD so that it can be addressed, child psychiatrist Richard L. Rubin, MD, adjunct associate professor at Dartmouth Medical College, tells Everyday Health., Oppositional Defiant Disorder
About 40 percent of children with ADHD also experience oppositional defiant disorder, according to ADDitude magazine. ODD includes bouts of aggression, outbursts, and extreme stubbornness; about half of young children who are diagnosed with ODD will outgrow it by age 8. Children with ADHD may struggle to communicate, which can lead to feelings of anger. In addition, their hyperactivity could be construed as disobedience. Sticking to recommended ADHD treatment can often help manage ODD symptoms as well., Bipolar Disorder
While children can have both bipolar disorder and ADHD, these conditions are also likely to be mistaken for one another, with ADHD being overdiagnosed and bipolar disorder being underdiagnosed in kids. ADHD and bipolar disorder have many traits in common, including impulsivity and hyperactivity. However, differences between ADHD and bipolar disorder may be subtle ‚Äî for example, a child in a depressive phase of bipolar disorder may have a problem paying attention due to a lack of interest or desire in participating in everyday activities, whereas a child with ADHD lacks the inability to focus for long periods of time., Anxiety
It‚Äôs not surprising that ADHD and anxiety go hand in hand, and it‚Äôs common for the conditions to be mistaken for one another. Some studies suggest that as many as 25 percent of children with ADHD also have anxiety disorders, and vice versa. Kids with anxiety issues may be shy and fearful, as can children with ADHD whose difficulty focusing or impulsivity can lead to problems relating to other kids. In addition, the medications used to treat ADHD can make kids more jittery and anxious. If you suspect your ADHD child may also have anxiety issues, let your doctor know. According to the NYU Child Study Center, children with both ADHD and anxiety may require different treatment (including medication and/or therapy) than those with either of the conditions alone., Depression
Approximately 18 percent of children with ADHD will suffer from depression in adolescence, recent research reports. Some experts believe there may be an underlying genetic link between ADHD and depression, making kids who are prone to one condition more vulnerable to the other. Adolescents may be especially vulnerable, as the challenges they may face socially or academically can contribute to their depression risk., Sleep Disorders
Several of the most visible symptoms of ADHD ‚Äî nervous energy, lack of focus, fidgeting ‚Äî can affect children‚Äôs sleeping patterns. A recent Australian study found that nearly three out of four children with ADHD also deal with sleep troubles. Children with ADHD may experience greater difficulty with self-regulating techniques such as calming and focusing, which affect their ability to fall (and remain) asleep. Stimulant medications for ADHD can contribute to insomnia as well.

If you‚Äôre concerned about your child‚Äôs sleeping troubles ‚Äî which can also include sleep apnea, bed-wetting, and nightmares ‚Äî talk to his doctor. Kids who don‚Äôt get enough sleep (quality or quantity) are more likely to have problems in school and will have poorer control over their ADHD symptoms, creating a vicious cycle., About 12 percent of children have ADHD ‚Äî a chronic condition that‚Äôs associated with hyperactive behavior, attention problems, and impulsivity. While ADHD is usually easily treatable with a combination of behavioral therapy and medication, many affected children also have a number of coexisting conditions that may be underdiagnosed, in part because parents and doctors aren‚Äôt looking for them.

That‚Äôs why the American Academy of Pediatrics called for doctors to assess such common health issues ‚Äî which range from depression to learning disabilities ‚Äî in its latest guidelines for diagnosing and treating ADHD, the first update in 10 years.

If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, be sure to look out for these other health concerns and discuss them with your child‚Äôs pediatrician., 8 Biggest Coexisting Conditions in ADHD Kids
ADHD is common in children, and so are a slew of other health issues ‚Äî from depression to dyslexia ‚Äî that tend to accompany the attention disorder. Could your kid be affected by one of these often underdiagnosed concerns?

By concentrating on one goal at a time, you‚Äôll be better able to achieve all your goals., Know thyself. ‚ÄúOne of my best tips for keeping focus is to know yourself,‚Äù Guffanti says. ‚ÄúFrom the time I was 18, I lost my car keys on a regular basis. What ultimately solved my problem was my daughter giving me a chain to attach my keys to my pants. Now, unless I lose my pants, I‚Äôll always have my keys.‚Äù Acknowledge issues that cause you to lose focus (or things), and then find an appropriate solution for them that you can effectively employ., Look the clock in its face. People with ADHD symptoms have almost no sense of time, Guffanti says. ‚ÄúWe think forward and backward in time, and when you do that, time becomes irrelevant to you," he explains. Keep a clock where you can see it easily, so it serves as a reminder of the here and now. When you make your plan for the day, include not only what tasks you need to accomplish, but also by what time. Use the clock to help you concentrate and stick to your plan., Eliminate clutter. ‚ÄúThis is important,‚Äù Guffanti says. ‚ÄúClean your desk. You don‚Äôt want to have 20 zillion things to look at. Just leave what you need for the project or two that you‚Äôre working on. A clean desk helps you think more clearly, and that‚Äôs true whether or not you have ADHD.‚Äù, Plan ahead. ‚ÄúEach day before I quit working, I organize myself for the next day,‚Äù Guffanti says. ‚ÄúIt helps me to know where to start when I come back tomorrow. I can pick up exactly where I left off rather than wasting time figuring out what to do.‚Äù, Prioritize. ‚ÄúYou have to keep your priorities straight or you will get distracted,‚Äù Guffanti stresses. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very important for people with ADHD.‚Äù Before you begin a task, break it into smaller steps and check them off as you complete them to help keep you on target., TIPS: Refocusing Your Attention When You Have ADHD-By Beth W.

In addition to the challenges, there are also positive traits associated with people who have attention deficit disorder:

Creativity ‚Äì Children who have ADD/ADHD can be marvelously creative and imaginative. The child who daydreams and has ten different thoughts at once can become a master problem-solver, a fountain of ideas, or an inventive artist. Children with ADD/ADHD may be easily distracted, but sometimes they notice what others don‚Äôt see. 
Flexibility ‚Äì Because children with ADD/ADHD consider a lot of options at once, they don‚Äôt become set on one alternative early on and are more open to different ideas. 
Enthusiasm and spontaneity ‚Äì Children with ADD/ADHD are rarely boring! They‚Äôre interested in a lot of different things and have lively personalities. In short, if they‚Äôre not exasperating you (and sometimes even when they are), they‚Äôre a lot of fun to be with. 
Energy and drive ‚Äì When kids with ADD/ADHD are motivated, they work or play hard and strive to succeed. It actually may be difficult to distract them from a task that interests them, especially if the activity is interactive or hands-on., Children with impulsive signs and symptoms of ADD/ADHD also tend to be moody and to overreact emotionally. As a result, others may start to view the child as disrespectful, weird, or needy., Signs, Symptoms, Effects, and Treatment-

All children are oppositional from time to time, particularly when tired, hungry, stressed or upset.  They may argue, talk back, disobey, and defy parents, teachers, and other adults.  Oppositional behavior is often a normal part of development for two to three year olds and early adolescents.  However, openly uncooperative and hostile behavior becomes a serious concern when it is so frequent and consistent that it stands out when compared with other children of the same age and developmental level and when it affects the child‚Äôs social, family and academic life. -Melvin Oatis, M.D., http://add.about.com/od/Personal-Parenting-Stories/a/Adhd-Awareness-And-Education.htm?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter, ADHD: frequent shifts in conversation, not listening to others, not keeping one's mind on conversations, and not following details or rules of activities in social situations, ADHD: easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli and frequently interrupting ongoing tasks to attend to trivial noises or events that are usually ignored by others, ADHD: failure to complete tasks such as homework or chores, ADHD: frequent shifts from one uncompleted activity to another, ADHD: disorganized work habits, Bullying/Females
