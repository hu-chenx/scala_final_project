The two then ran a victory lap hand-in-hand., Great Britain’s Derek Redmond provided one of the more poignant moments of the Games: When the sprinter pulled his hamstring and collapsed during the semifinals of the men’s 400m, his father, Jim, ran to his aid and helped him cross the finish line., null, Meanwhile, Jackie Joyner-Kersee set a world record in the heptathlon, erasing the pain of a five-point loss in 1984.
