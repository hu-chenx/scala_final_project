Should You Juice? Cleansing your Mind, Body, and Wallet
Green juice, detoxes, and weight loss, the most common words you‚Äôll hear as you begin your ride on the juice cleanse health train. The story behind the latest health craze, and whether it‚Äôs for you.
Do you really need to cleanse? ‚ÄúBuying the cleanse is the hardest part.‚Äù Says Pure Cold Press Juicery owner, Haim Cohen. Popping up on both the East and West Coasts, the juice cleanse trend is in full swing, making its way to Boston. With local juice and health shops opening, juices and cleanses are easily available. The question remains, are they good for you? ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, health comes at a price, but it‚Äôs worth it,‚Äù says Cohen.
U.S. dietary and health guidelines suggest five to thirteen servings of fruits and vegetables a day, while a single eight ounce bottle of juice can contain easily six servings of fruits and vegetables, it would seem that drinking a juice is the clear path to a healthy balanced diet.
As the first step in working towards a healthy lifestyle, one of the in-house holistic health coaches warns the juice cleanse is not a quick fix. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take a sip of green juice and expect a ten pound weight loss, health is about sustainability, but drinking your vegetables is one way to get healthy.‚Äù
Listening to the hype of friends saying they ‚Äúfeel better than ever!‚Äù can be due to people believing that they are doing something great for their bodies, in addition to eliminating all processed foods during a cleanse, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The typical juice cleanse entails approximately six, eight ounce bottles per day, and can range from $150-$250 for the recommended three-day cleanse.
But is this lifestyle sustainable? Cohen says there is a huge audience in Boston alone. ‚ÄúPeople try it once, go away on vacation, and return a few months later to do another cleanse. We feel that is it a way of life.‚Äù
After following actress Gwyneth Paltrow‚Äôs lifestyle blog, goop, health science student Sasha Engelman decided to give the juice cleanse a chance.
‚ÄúAt the end of the day this is a trend, and what people need to focus on is whole balanced diets. Replacing a Coke with a large bottle of juice is a great way to get healthy.‚Äù Says Cohen.
Pure Cold Press Juicery owner Cohen doesn‚Äôt see the trend slowing these days, people continue to come into his store sometimes twice a day to buy his freshly pressed juices.
