Register@shoot4thesky.com, Something I really struggled with in this rehab process...was regaining my range of motion. Earlier on, my knee was considered arthrofibrotic (scar tissue which made my knee super stiff). I felt like I was falling behind in my rehab bc of it. I was starting to feel sorry for myself. Now, after committing to stretching and doing my home exercises everyday, my athletic/strength trainers, doctors, family... I am proud to say that I have regained FULL range of motion!

Thanks so much for all the prayers and kind words! All smiles over here üòÅüòÅüòÅ, üòÅ, Gotta keep going...., Ever since I could remember, I loved the game of basketball. Once I discovered what it was, I was fascinated by it. I found my passion at 5 years old....I wanted to play ball! Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the game could take me the places it has. I met some of my best friends and mentors, traveled the world, went to college for free, the list goes on and on.... I've never been forced to be without it, because I've always been healthy enough to practice and play! Until now.....a torn ACL is never something I thought would be a part of my story. But you know what they say?, "When man plans, God laughs." This injury is one of my tests I had to go through to give my testimony in the end!

Thank you for all the prayers, well wishes, and kind words. It really means a lot to me. This is a tough pill to swallow....but with God, and the support of my family, friends, and fans, how can I be NOT be positive!

It just sucks that I have to learn to walk all over again......but I promise you, my NEW walk will be so glorious! #ShockTulsa, GAAAAAAAAAAAAAME DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!, Great week for Shock Fans! 2-0 and 6-1 overall!
