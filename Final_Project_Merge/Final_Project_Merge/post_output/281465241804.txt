Boston Senior Home Care which has kept over 5,300 elderly people safe in
their homes; the Chinese Cultural Connection through organizing walks,
sponsoring after-school programs and other charities; and give back to our
loyal customers with an annual Customer Appreciation Day providing
complimentary food, beverage and entertainment to our friends and family
who have kept the South Street Diner going all these years. Our goal is to
continue to serve the community with quality food and outstanding service
at an affordable price, and we continue to appreciate those that have made
the South Street Diner what it is today.
 
 and we are continuously looking for ways to get even more involved
regardless of age, sex, religion, ethnicity, etc., It's a meatloaf night, Dear Friends in Boston,

SOUTH STREET DINER

Anyone who grew up in a place where car culture is as prevalent as establishments that close at 9 p.m.—or as they’re known to science, “the suburbs”—knows that 24-hour diners are your weekend Godsend. You’re looking for somewhere that you and your badass friends who don’t give a shit that it’s past midnight can go to chill, and, thankfully for you, diners are made for loiterers and hooligans. The South Street Diner, one of the few 24-hour places in the Greater Boston Area, is much like my favorite Minnesotan shithole, The Flameburger. They have a lot of similarities: the décor that ages like Tommy Lee Jones, all grizzled and reeking of cigarettes. The greasy food that, despite its obvious contribution to your shortened life span, always seems like the best decision you could be making at that moment.  The intriguing waitstaff that you swear never leaves, yet still manages to give you a smile and toss you a standard-issue joke. Yes, it’s like my nights of drunken debauchery/mornings of hungover debauchery haven’t changed when I slide into a patent-leather booth at the South Street Diner. Growing up is for quitters, anyway.
