When entering, the lobby was shining and tranquil with the settle colors of the sea. Being that the bistro is inside Seaport Boston Hotel, it was a little busy with guests checking in, but once seated in the big lounge chairs, everyone was relaxed and tired from the touring of the day. Our server was the F&B Manager herself, Taylor, and recommended their new Spring cocktail menu with a lot of flavors and spirits to choose from. We ordered drinks first and looked over their variety choices of appetizers and extended international dishes. We started with the BBQ Nachos which served plenty to share among us four, then moved to the Lobster Salad Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll which Gillman, another server who helped Taylor when she was attending guests, attended us recommended. When the food came, we were all surprised at the presentation and how delicious it was. We ordered one more round of drinks and called it a day. 
I would love to go back to Tamo in the future. Their friendly staff was very helpful and observant towards us. The decor of the hotel felt so peaceful and their elegant food fusion is a MUST.", Blue Hills Bank Pavilion has some great shows coming up next month.  Park at TAMO and catch dinner before the show!

For our barrel aged cocktails, a batch of the cocktail is premade and aged for up to 4 weeks in a small oak cask.

The aging allows the drink to mellow out ( takes away some of the harsh edges), and the oxidation opens up an additional layer of flavor.

It also makes for speedy service where the bartender is just pouring it into shaker , shaking& straining it, then adding garnish.
 
Current barrel-aged recipes at TAMO:

Between the Sheets

2 bottles of Clement Rum
2 bottles of Clement Shrub
2 bottles of Brandy
Let age for 4 weeks.

To serve, pour 3 oz from barrel, add fresh lime juice, shake over ice, strain into Martini glass, Lime garnish.
 
TAMO Takes Manhattan

2 bottles Angel Envy (we’ll be using the TAMO Blend once it arrives in May)
14 oz Atsby Vermouth
4 oz Peychaud Bitters

To serve, pour 3 oz from barrel, shake over ice, strain into Martini glass, Cherry garnish.
