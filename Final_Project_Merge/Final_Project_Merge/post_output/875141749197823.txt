http://akronschools.com/calendar, To help understand the difference between public schools and publicly funded charter schools, we offer this explanation we feel is valuable to our citizens.

This is from Denis Smith, a former Ohio Department of Education consultant in the charter school office.
---
Our community is proud of its public schools. We can proudly say that they are our schools. Yes, we own and govern them through our friends and neighbors whom we elect to our community school board. Yes, we are indeed proud of our school system as it represents and is the core of our community.

In Ohio, there is another kind of school type that we need to learn more about. This type of organization is called a "community" or "public" charter school. But no matter what its name, is this type of school really a community school or a public school?

No.

Many people don't think so and believe the use of the words community and public to describe a charter school are not only inaccurate but also misleading. Here's why:
 
1. Charter schools are privately operated but publicly funded. Since they're privately operated, charters are exempt from 150 state laws that public schools must comply with as they serve a public purpose in a community setting.

2. Our public schools are governed by our publicly elected school board, neighbors who are voted in office to serve us. Charter schools have unelected boards that are hand-picked by the private school operator, and there is no legal requirement that these individuals even live in the community where the charter school is located, be elected by the public or the parents served by the school, or even be American citizens.

3. Since most charter schools are run by for-profit management companies that are private enterprises, they are not obligated to disclose the salaries of the school leaders or of other employees of the school.

4. Researchers around the country have shown that many charter school administrator salaries are much higher than school district superintendents. In New York City, for example, the salaries for charter school administrators who are responsible for only a handful of schools are paid more than double the salary of the public school chancellor, who is responsible for nearly 1,600 schools. http:/www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/top-16-nyc-charter-school-execs-out-earn-chancellor-dennis-walcott-article-1.1497717

5. Under Ohio law, there is no legal requirement for the charter school leader to have any kind of professional license or even a degree.

6. The deductions for state financial aid for charter school students from a school district's allocation exceed the amount per pupil of state aid going to that district, a fact documented in the Columbus Dispatch. Residents of public school districts whose children attend a local public school are being deprived of public tax dollars needed for public education in order to support privately operated and non-transparent charter schools. http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/09/09/ohios-charter-schools-essentially-get-local-property-tax-money.html

7. Not only do public school districts receive less state aid per pupil than charter schools, they must also provide transportation for charter students to their schools, an additional expense incurred by public school districts in order to support these privately operated schools.

8. Many national studies have shown that charter schools normally serve a smaller percentage of students with special needs, children who require additional support at an increased cost per pupil. Public schools, our community schools, are pledged to serve all children.
 
There is a new tool that allows school district residents to look up important data about the condition and performance of their community schools and compare that to charter schools. Go to this website to find out more specific information: http://knowyourcharter.com/

As citizens look at these examples of how charter schools receive public tax dollars but otherwise operate freely due to 150 exemptions in state law that public school districts otherwise must follow, they are concerned about what kind of schools they really are. 

Here is one important development that has been felt in Ohio.
In September 2015, the Washington Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling that was felt across the country, held that "taxpayer-funded charter schools are unconstitutional, reasoning that charters are not truly public schools because they aren't governed by elected boards and therefore not accountable to voters." 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/what-makes-a-public-school-public-washington-state-court-finds-charter-schools-unconstitutional/2015/09/08/706975c8-5632-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html

As residents of our school district learn more about charter schools, they may also come to the same conclusion as the justices of the Washington Supreme Court did a few months ago. The schools in our district are public institutions owned by all of us. They are our community schools, operated under all provisions of the state law.

A final thought: If charter schools, operated by private companies with hand-picked boards that are unaccountable to Ohio citizens and are exempt from numerous state laws but still receive public tax dollars without voter approval, they are not public schools. And if they're not public schools, we should not be paying for them.
If you agree, start a conversation among your friends. After all, great schools make great communities. 

After all, it's about we the people who will administer and govern our community schools, not private companies who aren't accountable to citizens., null, Tops in Bots Again!

http://www.akronschools.com/headlines/1935, A P S: Calamity Day Update

Many of our followers recommend our employing a two-hour delay on days where early morning weather leads to cancellation of classes.  However, due (in large part) to the logistics of transporting not only our own students, but students to 50 other private, parochial and charter schools this creates myriad problems. 

Keep in mind, different schools have different starting times (even within our own district) and some children might not get to school until 11 am (only to leave for the day three and a half hours later).  

We continue to explore this possibility, however., All Akron Public School After School Activities will be canceled today, Tuesday, February 24, 2015., Due to weather conditions, Akron Public Schools will not conduct classes today, Tuesday, February 24, 2015.

https://weather.yahoo.com/united-states/ohio/akron-2352491/, A P S: How We Decide on 'Snow Days'

Inclement Weather Procecures
 
Calling a snow day is always a difficult decision, and we do not make these decisions lightly. As superintendent of our school district, my decision to close school is always based on the safety of our students and staff. Although there are no hard and fast rules when deciding to close school due to inclement weather, the following conditions are considered:
◾
the amount of snow on the ground

◾
the projected amount of snow to fall

◾
weather forecast for the school day

◾
road conditions

◾
temperature

◾
wind chill

◾
ability of the City of Akron to plow and salt the streets

◾
conditions of school parking lots and sidewalks. 

When hazardous weather arrives in our community, the most important issue is the safety of our students and employees. As parents, you have the right to keep your students home if you feel it is not safe. In addition, if APS decides to stay open during difficult weather conditions, students will not be marked tardy until after 10 a.m.

If we do close school, my goal will be to make a decision by 5:30 or 6 a.m. When the decision is made, we will send automatic phone messages that reach all of our families and staff members; and we will contact all local radio, TV and newspapers.

Please understand that we make difficult decisions about snow days with thoughtful, well-researched and conscientious practices and procedures.

Sincerely,

David W. James
Superintendent

From Superintendent David James, a brief note about inclement weather and decision making...

                          Inclement Weather Procedures

Calling a snow day is always a difficult decision, and we do not make these decisions lightly. As superintendent of our school district, my decision to close school is always based on the safety of our students and staff. Although there are no hard and fast rules when deciding to close school due to inclement weather, the following conditions are considered:

• the amount of snow on the ground
• the projected amount of snow to fall
• weather forecast for the school day
• road conditions
• temperature
• wind chill
• ability of the City of Akron to plow and salt the streets
• conditions of school parking lots and sidewalks. 

When hazardous weather arrives in our community, the most important issue is the safety of our students and employees. As parents, you have the right to keep your students home if you feel it is not safe. In addition, if APS decides to stay open during difficult weather conditions, students will not be marked tardy until after 10 a.m.

If we do close school, my goal will be to make a decision by 5:30 or 6 a.m. When the decision is made, we will send automatic phone messages that reach all of our families and staff members; and we will contact all local radio, TV and newspapers.

Please understand that we make difficult decisions about snow days with thoughtful, well-researched and conscientious practices and procedures.

Sincerely,
David W. James
Superintendent

We “fall back” an hour this coming Sunday, and some experts suggest that the time to change clocks also provides a good occasion for you to take care of other tasks.

The end of Daylight Saving Time, they say, can mean the start of saving time, money and maybe even someone’s life if you make — and complete — a checklist of home-maintenance chores.

For the potential life-saving part, just make a point to check smoke-alarm batteries at the same time you change all your clocks. 

How about replacing light bulbs? The shorter days mean more periods of evening darkness.  If you have the ladder out anyway to reach smoke detectors and clocks on Time Change Sunday, double up on safety (and energy savings) by checking for light bulbs and fixtures.

Among the fall and winter home-maintenance tips suggested by Lowe’s Home Improvement are these:

Outdoors, clean gutters and downspouts. Close or install storm windows. Remove hoses from spigots and drain them. Store hoses indoors, coiled and flat. Find winter storage places for outdoor furniture and cushions.

Indoors, check windows and doors for weather-tightness and install weather stripping where it's needed. Have your furnace professionally inspected. Dust blinds and vacuum curtains throughout your house. Clean out kitchen and bathroom cabinets and throw away outdated food, medicine and cosmetics.

Larry Bender
Ritzman Community Learning Center
629 Canton Rd
Akron, Ohio 44312

Dear Principal Bender:

Congratulations! I’m happy to share with you that the Ohio Department of Education has named Ritzman Community Learning Center a High Progress School of Honor for the second year, based on your building’s 2013-2014 Ohio School Report Card data on student reading and math performance. 

The Schools of Honor program looks at schools with a high percentage of students from economically disadvantaged homes and tracks the performance of all students in these areas for the five most recent years. It spotlights schools that have shown sustained progress in student performance by all students over that time period.

Learn more details about the High Progress Schools of Honor selection criteria at education.ohio.gov.

By showing consistent progress in raising math and reading skills for all student groups, you have proved that administrators, teachers and families who have high expectations and provide continual support can enable students from all backgrounds to achieve academically. Together, you are opening up a world of opportunities for your students and building a wonderful legacy for your community.  

It takes bold leadership and great personal and professional commitment to accomplish this. I thank you for the role you are playing. Also please pass on my thanks to those who have shared in your school’s success. I hope you all will share the lessons you’ve learned with other Ohio schools. 

In the coming weeks, we will be sending you a High Progress School of Honor banner to display in your building. If you have questions about the banner or the award, please contact Sherry Panizo in our Office of Policy and Research at (614) 387-0546 or sherry.panizo@education.ohio.gov.

Dear Principal Johnson:
 
My greatest commitment as the leader of Ohio’s public education system is to make sure that every child, in every school, in every Ohio community receives the best education possible. That’s why I am pleased to tell you that the Ohio Department of Education has named Akron STEM High School a 2014 Ohio School of Promise based on your 2014 Ohio School Report Card. This is the first year your school has received this honor.
 
We all know that poverty presents major challenges to student achievement, and it often continues from generation to generation. Yet with 40 percent or more of Akron STEM High School’s students coming from low-income homes, your school has closed the math and reading achievement gap for students from every background. That means all of your girls and boys are gaining the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in college, other postsecondary training, jobs and life. Only schools like yours can help break the cycle of poverty. What a wonderful legacy you are building for your community. 
 
As one of 98 elite Schools of Promise in Ohio, you have set a strong example of what educators, parents and community members can achieve when they work together with student achievement as the goal. I thank you for your leadership and ask you to pass on my thanks to others who share in your success. Akron STEM High School truly is a School of Promise for all of your students. 
 
In the coming weeks, you will receive an official School of Promise banner to display in your school building. If you have questions about the banner or the award, please contact Sherry Panizo in the Office of Policy and Research at (614) 387-0546 or sherry.panizo@education.ohio.gov.

The School of Practical Nursing
(Our programs are amazing!)

History of the School of Practical Nursing

In 1951, Worth Howard, executive director of Akron City Hospital, was sensitive to the need for more nurses. He approached the Akron Board of Education about the possibility of meeting the need through vocational education. 

The program, which was the seventh in the state of Ohio, opened in September 1951 and was approved by the National Association of Practical Nurse Education and Services Inc. 

The School of Practical Nursing was operated by the Akron Board of Education and with the cooperation of the Akron hospitals. In 1956, the school received approval from the Ohio State Board of Nursing Education and Registration and, in 1976, was accredited by the National League for Nursing. 

Initially located in the Leggett Elementary School building it moved to Margaret Park Elementary School, then back to expanded facilities in the Leggett Elementary School building in 1967.  

There were 27 students in the first class. In 2009, the Akron School of Practical Nursing was moved into the Erie Island building off Copley Road.  

To date, the Akron School of Practical Nursing has graduated more than 5,000 nurses. The passage rate on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) remains between 92-100%, and the demand for graduates continues to be very high in the health-care community., A P S:Handy-Dandy Calendar

History of Smith Elementary School

Smith Elementary School was constructed in 1918 and named in honor of Fred E. Smith (1857-1940).  Mr. Smith was a leader in the early development of the town of Kenmore, which was originally part of the Coventry Township District. He bought a large piece of land from the Akron Realty Co. and later donated land to build a school in the community before it was later annexed by the Akron School District in 1920., null, #akronschools APS is calling all creative kids...  http://t.co/gaMwxXOyc5 http://t.co/ELdEIGYxGC, APS Weekly - September 8-14 #constantcontact http://t.co/VLF2lThS4n, APS Weekly - September 8-14 http://conta.cc/1vNmd5R, #akronschools APS/Sports calendar is out for this week.... http://t.co/MAHVZFc40w http://t.co/566KsRFI4y, #akronschools APS/LeBron: Only the best for his kids...

Pendleton is former CFO/COO for Barberton schools

The Akron School Board has just voted unanimously to approve hiring Ryan Pendleton as its new district treasurer. Pendleton has spent the past nine years in the Barberton city school system as its chief financial officer and chief operating officer. 

The 40 year old graduate of Malone College (bachelor’s degree) and Cleveland State University (master’s degree) began his career in 1998 in the private sector as an account manager.

Pendleton was selected after a search began in May, when APS Treasurer Jack Pierson announced his retirement. 

“We began with 27 applicants,” said Board President Lisa Mansfield. “We pared that number to nine and began interviewing. Then we had three finalists, and Ryan’s name immediately rose to the top.”

Pendleton is a member of the board of NEOnet (Northeast Ohio Network for Educational Technology).

Pendleton’s annual salary is $132,500.00., #akronschools APS board selects Barberton CS CFO/COO Ryan Pendleton, 40, as its new treasurer.  Unanimous vote at tonight's board meeting., A P S: The Yum Factor

http://www.akronschools.com/headlines/1136, http://www.akronschools.com/headlines/1135, null, APS: THE STATE OF EDUCATION

by Rene Garrett
(The following article was written by William Phillis, Ohio E & A.)

The marketing budgets of charter schools diminish educational opportunities for all students.
 
Ohio charter schools spend enormous amounts of tax dollars on marketing aimed primarily at student recruitment. A northeastern Ohio online charter school that serves in the range of 1,200 students reported that, in the 2013-14 school year, $185,285 was spent on marketing. This is money appropriated for public education but used instead for public relations and student recruitment. Atrocious!
 
Clever radio and TV ads that promote charter schools flood the airwaves. The cost of these and other marketing efforts are borne by the school district budgets from which charter school money is extracted by state decree; hence, all students lose by this obscene use of tax dollars.
 
State officials have the obligation to ensure the effective and efficient use of tax dollars. The governor and general assembly have the first line of responsibility. The auditor, attorney general, state superintendent and state board of education all have general statutory authority to impose measures to ensure effective and efficient use of tax dollars.

1 hour ago, APS SMART THOUGHT: “Education is every day and everywhere; the only thing you have to pay is attention.”

History of Robinson CLC
Robinson Community Learning Center is named in honor of Henry Robinson, a banker, civic leader and pioneer manufacturer of clay products, as well as one of the original benefactors of Akron City Hospital. The original school building was built in 1912.  It was remodeled several times, and additional land was later purchased to enlarge the playground.  The school was closed in 1979, but reopened in 1980. 

The groundbreaking for the new Robinson CLC building took place on March 2, 2007. The dedication ceremony was held on September 4, 2008 and classes started in new building on August 27, 2008., null, #akronschools  APS FREE SUMMER CAMP????

History of Portage Path CLC
The original Portage Path Elementary School building was constructed in 1908. The school’s origins can be traced back to the “Portage Path,” the path used by Native Americans who journeyed from Lake Erie to the Ohio River, using the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas Rivers of Summit County as a link. 

These two rivers were separated by a distance of only eight miles and were connected by the "Portage Path."  It followed the present Portage Path road south to Copley Road, through Perkins Woods, dropped near Manchester Road and then ended at a landing near Long Lake. 

By 1850, a small stone building known as the Chestnut Grove School served as the first school in this district. By the early 1900s, the growth of the city and continued westward expansion led to the building of a new school, eventually known as the “Portage Path” school, which took its name from the famous Indian trail of so long ago., Check out the latest news from the Akron Board of Education! http://t.co/8Fy0mkysMu, A P S: Thanks to Our Friends at St. Sebastian School

The new building housed 10th-, 11th- and 12th-grade students and officially became North High School. Two wars and the Depression delayed the completion of the building for 24 years. In 1955, a major addition including an auditorium, cafeteria and gymnasium was completed. Then in 1970, a vocational wing was added; and, in September 1972, North High School became a four-year high school once again., null, #akronschools APS http://t.co/dPMgsiFdJM OGT summer testing.

“In large part, we are teachers precisely because we remember what it was like to be a student. Someone inspired us. Someone influenced us. Or someone hurt us. And we’ve channeled that joy (or pain) into our own unique philosophies on life and learning, and we’re always looking for an opportunity to share them — with each other, our students, parents or in our communities.”

History of the NIHF STEM Middle School

Since 2010, the NIHF STEM Middle School has been located at 199 S. Broadway, Akron, the former site of the National Inventors Hall of Fame Foundation.  

Akron has a long history of innovation in industry, science and education. A new chapter in the city's exciting story began in 2003. The state offered Akron Public Schools 59% of the total cost to rebuild its schools, if a local match could be found. Akron's mayor moved quickly to help the schools by putting a small income tax on the ballot. The city and the school officials promised voters that the new buildings would become more than schools. 

These new buildings would become innovative Community Learning Centers – a school by day and a community center for learning at night and on weekends. Overwhelmingly, the community agreed and building began., Cardinals take on Griffs at Erie Island.

From a grateful elementary school parent----

From: Amy White
Today is my sons last day of kindergarten at McEbright elementary and boy what a year it has been. 

He had never been to daycare or preschool so this transition was especially hard for him. Not the first few days or weeks like most kids, all year we struggled. I want to give a very special thank you to my sons teacher Mrs. Filon for showing a great deal or understanding and compassion with him and not giving up on him and Mrs. Selby the schools secretary has been a god send to me and him. 

She took him under her wing and helped him through all the tough mornings when he would just cry because I was leaving him there and she made sure he was comforted and ready to take the walk down the hall to class..honestly all the school staff has helped with my sons transition from my stay at home baby to the big and much more confident guy is he today...

The kids made it for Mrs. Farley, and it comes to us by way of Maryann Miller-Miller.  Her son Casey was in the kindergarten class at Windemere.

Each child was given a square of material to put a handprint on and sign her/his name.  One of Maryann's friends, her mother and Maryann put the quilt together. 

The kids gave it to Mrs. Farley the last day of school.

-History of Mason CLC
The original Mason Elementary School was constructed and opened in 1913.  It was named in honor of Frank H. Mason (1852-1931), who served as vice president of Goodrich Rubber Works, Akron’s first rubber company, in 1907, and later became vice chairman of its Board of Directors.  

In September 1910, when Akron Public Schools suspended medical inspections in the schools due to lack of funding, Mr. Mason offered to pay the costs of employing visiting nurses in the schools for one year to ensure student health. In recognition of his generosity, the Akron Board of Education named the proposed school on Beaver Street the "Frank H. Mason School.", A P S: Steeeeeeerike!

We built Litchfield in 1959 and finished an addition in 1964.  It is named in honor of Paul Weeks Litchfield (1875-1959) who came to town in 1900 from Boston to assume the role of superintendent of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. 

Eventually, he became president of the company, then chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  Litchfield felt strongly about the value of education, regarding it as a primary force in the lives of individuals. 

He was one of the first technically-trained, college-graduated men to enter the rubber industry. He established the Goodyear Training Center and was an active, ardent supporter of Akron Public Schools and The University of Akron., East Dragons vs Kenmore Cardinals - April 19, 2014: http://t.co/YrQS8kFjhY via @YouTube, North Vikings vs Buchtel Griffins Game Highlights: http://t.co/5oBMwoAilF via @YouTube, #akronschools APS has so much going on, we need a really big calendar.

-History of King Elementary School
King Elementary School was constructed in 1923 and is named in honor of three members of the King family, and important family in Akron History: Leicester King, David L. King and Henry W. King. 

Leicester King served as an associate judge of Trumbull County for seven years and was given a large area of land in North Akron in 1934. In 1840, he built the Cascade Mill and was a key promoter of the Pennsylvania & Ohio Canal. He is thought to be responsible for changing the plan of the canal route so it would come through Akron.

-Our History
Jennings School was built in 1915, with expansions constructed in 1917, 1921 and 1957. The school was named in honor of Isaac Jennings (1822-87), who has been called the father and founder of Akron Public Schools. 

Rev. Jennings chaired a committee appointed to work out a plan for the area’s schools. The plan provided for incorporating the whole town into one school district and separating them into primary, secondary and high schools. 

He advocated free admission to all schools, with support coming from taxes, and governance coming from an elected school board. This plan was adopted by the Ohio State Legislature and has been a model for public education nationwide. 

APS broke ground on the new Jennings CLC on March 11, 2006 as part of an $800 million project to rebuild or renovate all of the district schools. Jennings CLC opened to students on December 3, 2007., A P S: You May Be Interested in...

History of Harris Elementary School
Harris Elementary School is named in honor of Malana A. Harris (1842-1904), a Pennsylvania native who served as an Akron Public Schools teacher for 29 years.

Before Harris arrived, the city did not offer kindergarten classes, which was a new idea at that time.  Harris championed the importance of kindergarten and taught the first kindergarten classes in the area.  

The original building was constructed in 1922 and is located on the site of the former Caldwell School, which was built in 1906 for Portage Township. The school was annexed by Akron Public Schools in 1916., null, #akronschools APS Leggett, Jennings team with Akron, PwC » Akron Public Schools - http://t.co/jKAUIOrrQp via @YourSite, #akronschools APS and Trinity Church Clothing Room Open » Akron Public Schools - http://t.co/dkJg0YJIn1 via @YourSite, A P S: Your Family Matters: Work it Out

-History of Glover CLC

The new Glover Community Learning Center was opened on December 17, 2008.  The original school building was constructed in 1918. The school is named in honor of Nathan L. Glover (1842-1923), the first supervisor of music education in Akron Public Schools. 

In September 1872, Glover was hired as a vocal music teacher for the Akron schools. For years, he was the only person in the music department, going to each school and conducting a music class in each room about every two weeks. 

Mr. Glover organized annual music festivals and formed glee clubs and choruses in each high school. Later, he became supervisor of music, coordinating the work of a staff of itinerant music teachers. Glover retired as head of the music department for Akron Public Schools in 1921 after 49 years of service with the school system. He was succeeded by his daughter, Nellie Glover., A P S: A Teachable Moment

Akron Public Schools dismissed classes early today at Kenmore HIgh School following a brawl on the second floor this morning that led to a lockdown.  

Akron Police Department officers and APS security personnel responded to an escalating fight shortly after 9am that eventually involved a couple dozen participants and the use, by police, of pepper spray.

THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  NO WEAPONS WERE USED DURING THE FIGHT AND NO WEAPONS WERE FOUND BY POLICE.   Police arrested a dozen students and sent them to the Juvenile Detention Center to face criminal charges.  

The early closing was precipitated by the application of pepper spray, an irritant, that is being cleaned up from the floors and the ventilating system at the school. 

Police believe the fight was a continuation of an altercation in the neighborhood surrounding the school Thursday evening., A P S: Hangout with Google at the...

History of Firestone Park Elementary School

Firestone Park Elementary School was built in 1917 and opened in 1919.  The area became a part of the City of Akron in 1916. 

The school was built soon at the wish of Harvey S. Firestone, the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.  His company purchased 1,000 acres of land southeast of the factory for a residential development called Firestone Park. 

Mr. Firestone wanted to provide an area which would meet the spiritual, educational and recreational needs of the plant workers, including the school.  In 1917, one year after the area had been annexed to the city of Akron, he deeded land to the Board of Education for the school. Throughout his life, Firestone enjoyed visiting and supporting the school., A P S: It's the Family Education Quiz....

Portage Path 

Original building constructed in 1908

Additions in 1916 and 1973

The Cuyahoga River was a major link in travel among the Indians who journeyed from Lake Erie to the Ohio River. Another important link was the Tuscarawas River. In Summit County, these two rivers were separated by a distance of only eight miles, with a trail connecting them. 

This trail was known as "Portage Path" It ran from Old Portage (five miles north of Akron) one-half mile west, rising more than 300 feet in one mile. It followed the present Portage Path south to Copley Road, through Perkins Woods, dropped near Manchester Road and then ended at a landing near Long Lake. 

By 1850, a small stone building known as the Chestnut Grove School served as the first school in this district. By the early 1900s, the growth of the city and continued westward expansion led to the building of a new school which took its name from the famous Indian trail of so long ago., A P S: Of Course You Need New Gear..

Firestone High School was constructed in 1962 and opened in September 1963.  The school was named in honor of Harvey S. Firestone (1868-1938), who, with capital acquired in a buggy tire business, came to Akron in 1900 and, with three associates, organized the Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. 

The ingenuity and aggressiveness of Harvey Firestone in providing tires for the automobile industry resulted in the rapid growth of his company and helped to make Akron the rubber capital of the world. Mr. Firestone had a keen interest in civic affairs in Akron. 

His family continued this tradition, donating funds for the natatorium facilities at Firestone High School., A P S: Supporting Achievement

The bulk of the land in the Ellet District was purchased in 1810 from Simon Perkins by three sons of Samuel Ellet, an early settler who moved into the area that year. The Ellet District was annexed to the city of Akron in 1929 and became part of Akron Public Schools the same year. 

Ellet High School on Woolf Avenue opened in 1950 and replaced an older Ellet High School on Canton Road that served both elementary and high school students., A P S: You'll Need Shoes for This....

Schumacher CLC

Constructed in 1929
Opened in September 1929
Additions in 1950 and 1953

Named in honor of Ferdinand Schumacher (1822-1908)
In 1856, Ferdinand Schumacher – known as the Cereal King of America – started an oatmeal processing plant on Howard Street. His business grew rapidly. By 1880, he was the foremost miller of the world. Following a disastrous fire in 1886 which destroyed an eight-story Jumbo Mill, Schumacher merged his business with that of the Akron Milling Co. 

In 1891, this concern was consolidated with the American Cereal Co. which, in 1901, became the Quaker Oats Co. Schumacher was an ardent prohibitionist. He owned various temperance hotels in Akron and was a generous contributor to church organizations. 

His wife, Mary L. Schumacher, continued the tradition of 
philanthropy through generous gifts to Schumacher School. When the school opened in 1929, she gave the school a baby grand piano; and, in her will, she established a trust fund of $5,000.

Board Approves Use of 'Blizzard Bags'

The Akron School Board considered the so-called Blizzard Bag option for making up lost class time due to winter weather.

The Ohio Department of Education has ruled that school districts, pending ODE approval, could send home lessons for students to make up for lost time.  Students would be given a specific amount of time to do the work, which could consist of on-line assignments or paper and pencil work…or both.

“We had our calamity day makeup formula in place at the start of the school year, so that was our go-to plan until ODE ruled we could consider using blizzard bags,” said Superintendent David W. James.

The original calamity plan was to add the number of make up days needed onto the end of the school year.  That plan has been replaced with the blizzard bag option.

Akron Public Schools must make up three days lost due to dangerous weather conditions.  In all, it used eight “calamity” days; five of those are forgiven by order of the ODE.  The last three days of lessons must be made up before the end of the school year.

Should the ODE approve of the blizzard bag plan, APS will notify parents of the specific details including when the materials will be distributed.

In 1885, he was elected to the Ohio Senate and in 1886 to the U.S. Congress. 

His service won for him a high reputation of integrity and intelligence for it was often said that "George Crouse's word is as good as his bond."

The David Hill Community Learning Center was opened to students on August 29, 2007. The original elementary school building was constructed in 1928 and named in honor of David E. Hill (1825-1901). In 1851, David E. Hill joined three other men to form the Akron Sewer Pipe Co., the first sewer pipe factory in the United States.  In 1873, Hill formed another pipe company – the Hill Sewer Pipe Co. – and served as president. In 1900, the two companies merged to form the American Sewer Pipe Co. Besides founding the sewer pipe industry, Hill also served as the first president of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., a member of City Council, a county commissioner and a member of the Middlebury School Board., null, A P S: On the Play Ground at Akron School for the Arts at FHS

Opened in February 1930

Addition in 1953

New building opened in 2010

Named in honor of George Barber (1805-79)

In 1845, George Barber – founder of the match industry in Akron – purchased a fledgling match manufacturing business, one of the first west of the Allegheny Mountains. Although he turned out good matches, his business was plagued by financial difficulties due to a poor sales distribution system. 

Consequently, he traded his factory for a hotel in 1852. After a year, he again embarked in the match business, being more successful the second time with the assistance of his son, Ohio Columbus Barber. 

By 1862, O.C. assumed the management of his father's business, which in 1868 was incorporated as the Barber Match Co. The company grew rapidly during the 1870s. Strike-anywhere matches, as they were called, came into general use throughout the nation. 

When George Barber died in 1879, the fledgling business he had started was making one-fifth of all the matches manufactured in the United States. His son, O.C. Barber, founded Barberton and became known as the "Match King of America.", A P S: Gowns to Go...

History of Betty Jane CLC

The original Betty Jane elementary school building was constructed in 1929.  The school was originally part of the Tallmadge School District but was annexed by Akron Public Schools in 1931.  It is named in honor of Betty Jane McBrayer (1921-27), the young daughter of Tallmadge Board of Education President Thomas McBrayer. As president of the school board, Mr. McBrayer worked to ensure that a new school would be built on Darrow Road. McBrayer's daughter attended school on the site of the present building before she died at a young age. 

After the new building was completed, the townspeople offered to name the new school McBrayer because of his untiring efforts in making it a reality, but Mr. McBrayer asked that the school be named instead in memory of his little girl, Betty Jane., RE POSTING, BY REQUEST...., APS: Plans for Makeup Days http://conta.cc/1lDq51f, A P S: Here it is...for Now...

To our Facebook family o' friends..

Our Facebook timeline is not intended for the use of parents who are violating the privacy of their own children.  APS is fiercely protective of student identities.  

Using Facebook to criticize or even attack Akron Public Schools for something involving your son or daughter puts the privacy of your child in jeopardy.

(No news=not closed)

Okay.  So many are upset we did not post here this morning that we were open for school today.  When we said last night that a decision would come this morning, we believed our audience would follow the long-standing rule that we tell you only when schools are closed, not when we are open. 
  
We apologize to those who were waiting.

In the future, let's try this...

Parents and students: plan as if there is school every day, unless informed otherwise here, on Twitter, local television, radio, our web site and with other reliable sources....

If the usual outlets that report on closings do NOT list APS as closed, simply know that there is school that day. 

Hope this helps for future snow days.  -editor, A P S: Walk the Walk?  Can't.  Too Snowy.

-From Donna Marie Wojcik

Charter adjustments

Courtesy Col. Dispatch
Nearly 30 percent Ohio charter schools have closed
A newspaper reports that 29 percent of Ohio's charter schools have closed dating back to 1997, including 17 schools last year in Columbus. The Columbus Dispatch reports that publicly funded charter schools that are often privately run became legal in Ohio in 1997. About 75 of the 400 charter schools currently operating in the state are in Columbus, where nine of the 17 schools that closed in 2013 lasted only a few months. Some of the nine schools closed because of money problems and some due to health and safety troubles. Some were closed by their sponsors. Advocates and critics of charter schools say one way to avoid closings is to do a better job deciding who should be allowed to open., A P S: Opportunity in the Art World

http://news.yahoo.com/video/6pm-charity-donates-shoes-children-223341974.html?soc_src=mediacontentsharebuttons, A Recycling Kick-off & Cart Give-a-way will be held on Saturday, October 26th @ Edgewood Homes 491 Vernon Odem Blvd. Akron at the Green Space/Park from 2:00PM to 4:00PM

To kick off and increase recycling among households ReWorks will educate residents and the city of Akron will provide curbside recycling carts to those living within the Edgewood Neighborhood. Once residents get their new cart and start recycling they will see a $2 reduction off their trash bill. 

ReWorks will provide donuts, cider, a gift made from recycled paper, and a quick demo on what is recyclable.  “We are hoping to double the amount of households that curbside recycle this weekend”, states Yolanda Walker, ReWorks Executive Director.  

A Recycling Session will be hosted by the Akron Urban League on Tuesday, October 29th from 9:00AM to 11:00AM at 440 Vernon Odem Blvd. Akron

Across from the Edgewood Village sits The Akron Urban League who recently signed onto ReWorks FREE Bthe1, Recycling that Works, Plastics, Bottles and Cans program wants to improve their own recycling program and also wants to host a recycling session to help spread recycling throughout the area. The recycling session will be held for leaders in Edgewood Neighborhood and will provide FREE recycling program packages to those that qualify, recycling consultation from ReWorks recycling program managers, and a take home tool kit to educate businesses and residents.

This session is provided to increase recycling in the neighborhood and in businesses. In addition, local churches, a tavern, daycare, grocery store, and schools located in the area will be invited to attend and learn about recycling opportunities.

Just atrocious
I read Doug Livingston’s article about failing charter schools (“Charter schools keep returning,” Sept. 7).
The situation at the Romig Road Community School is atrocious. The situation is filled with devious tricks for underhanded purposes and unfair treatment for taxpayers and the Akron Public Schools.

All of it is the result of David Brennan’s arrogant attitude toward the public schools. It should not be forgotten that he is the creator of this mess.

(from Voice of the People 9/14/13), APS: Don't you just love it when people get it???  Thanks, Mr. Gentry--- (copied letter-to-the-editor from Ohio.com 9/17/13)

Public priorities
I have long believed that there is no need for tax money to go to charter schools. School boards could establish special schools for those who need them. The story about charter schools recycling poor programs woke me up (“Charter schools keep returning,” Sept. 7).

Let’s end tax money going to charter schools and for-profit operating companies. If parents want their kids in private schools, they should pay for them.

Summer Arts Experience
 (Courtesy City of Akron)

 Fifty-eight Akron high school students are spending a good part of their summer in Downtown Akron as part of the City of Akron’s highly acclaimed “Lock 3 Summer Arts Experience,” which for the eleventh year is providing work for professional artists, education for students, and public artwork to inspire residents.
            The program was founded by Mayor Don Plusquellic in 2003, and allows “arts apprentices” to be mentored by professionals, to earn a paycheck, and create art that improves the cityscape in and around downtown.
            "I know the value of having a mentor," said the mayor. "Coaches were important to me as a young athlete. I wanted a program where young artists benefit from the same kind of relationships and can build a portfolio as part of the experience."
            The program solicits applications from Akron middle school and high school students each spring. Each applicant is interviewed by a panel of artists to determine the apprentices’ readiness and arts aptitude. In 2013, of the 190 students interviewed, 58 were selected and matched with one of the six lead artists for the 100 hour program, and 18 were chosen for the two 30 hour program. Apprentices, 14-17 years old, represent Akron area public and private schools.
            In 2008, the City expanded the summer arts program to include a “Neighborhood Canvas” component, consisting of just 30 hours of work to extend Summer Art’s reach to students who show artistic interest and talent but cannot commit to the full 100 hour program. This year, one of the neighborhood components created and installed a cement sculpture and bench along the towpath at Lock 3 Park while the other designed and created leather & metal jewelry to be marketed and displayed at the City of Akron’s Hardesty Park Arts Expo.
            This year’s program is funded in part by the Akron-Summit County Public Library and the City of Akron. The University of Akron’s School of Art and School of Dance partners with the program by contributing studio space for the dancers and the Summit County Dept. of Jobs & Family Services is allowing for the installation of a mural on their property.
            Since the beginning of the program, nearly 800 young people have completed the experience of creating performance or visual art during their summers. Other work-readiness activities include creating resumes, making presentations, and enhancing networking skills during meet-and-greets with local artists and public stakeholders. Students are also required to engage in Akron’s artistic community events by attending outings such as the Northside Art Walk, ushering at the Heinz-Poll Summer Dance Festival, and representing the program through talking about their artwork to patrons at the Hardesty Park Arts Expo.
     The 2013 Lock 3 Summer Arts Experience includes the following 100 hour components which will complete work between July 9th and August 14th:
Mosaic Tile Mural: Renowned artist Woodrow Nash and his 10 apprentices are developing a permanent mosaic tile mural to be installed on top of his existing mural on the exterior of the V. Odom Branch Library in Akron. This update will use Nash’s original imagery from the 1970s as inspiration, resulting in the apprentices transforming the existing figures of Malcolm X, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglas, and Martin Luther King Jr. into mosaics. This project is being completed at Nash’s “The Rage Gallery” (872 S. Main St., 44311) and was supported by the Akron-Summit County Public Library.
 
Steel Drums: Matt Dudack, the University of Akron’s steel drum director and a member of the Akron Symphony Orchestra, returns as lead artist of the steel drum component. In an amazingly short amount of time apprentices will learn pieces ranging from Trinidadian classics to Bob Marley’s “Three Little Birds.” The group consists of a diverse group of student musicians, some who play instruments other than steel drums and others who have never touched an instrument prior to the Experience. The Steel Drum component will perform at the Taste of Akron (July 25, 6:00pm-8:00pm), the Market at Lock 3 (July 26, Aug 2, & Aug 9, 11:30am – 1:00pm), the Northside Artwalk (Aug 3, 6:00pm-8:00pm) and the Akron Aeros Family FUNday (Aug. 18, 12:30pm - 2:00pm).
 
Metal & Glass Jewelry: Marianne Hite, celebrated Midwest glass artist, will teach her apprentices the rare technique of fused-glass jewelry. Marianne sells her art online (HiteOfGlass.com) and at various Northeast Ohio arts festivals in addition to teaching at the Peninsula Art Academy. She will use her experience of marketing and professional artistry as a case study in how to become a lifelong, thriving artist, guiding her apprentices in the development of their business skills. The metal & glass jewelry will be displayed and sold at the City of Akron’s Hardesty Park Arts Expo on July 27th and 28th.
 
 
High St. Mural: Steve Csejtey, art and photography teacher at Firestone High School, will enhance the art corridor of N. High St. between East Market St. and Martin Luther King Blvd. with the installation of a mural on the currently boarded-up windows along the Summit County’s Dept. of Job & Family Services parking garage. This new series of murals will provide a look into “Another World,” complementing the diverse artwork displayed in the rapidly expanding artistic alley that has developed on N. High St. The murals will be painted at Lock 3 on strips of canvas and then permanently installed on the boards at the parking garage.
 
S. Broadway Abstract Mural: Artist Nathan Mayfield and his apprentices are undertaking a 700ft. long mural on the Eastern retaining wall along S. Broadway. The geometric black & white mural will welcome drivers headed Downtown as it grows denser, climaxing with the abstraction of the Akron City Seal, and finally fading away as drivers reach the end of the wall. The mural will be created at Lock 3 park on strips of canvas, then permanently installed in methods similar to other Summer Arts murals such as those on the side of the Civic Theatre and Rosa Parks Dr.
 
Dance: NEOS Dance Theatre artistic director Bobby Wesner and several NEOS professional dancers will direct 9 apprentices through the process of dance choreography, music selection, dance form, practice and finally performance at the City of Akron’s Heinz-Poll Summer Dance Festival. Apprentices choreograph and practice at Guzetta Hall courtesy of the University of Akron and will ultimately perform on August 9th and 10th preceding NEOS Dance Theatre as part of the Heinz-Poll summer dance festival (Firestone Park, 8:15pm).
 
            Applications for the Lock 3 Summer Arts Experience are delivered to Akron area schools and posted to the City’s Summer Arts Experience Website annually in March. www.akronohio.gov/lock3live/sae.htm.

(From Letters to the Editor, May 24, 2013)
Building careers, brick by brick

I would like to give credit to the masonry program at Buchtel and Matt Simpson. After reading an article (“Masonry careers begin with solid foundations,” March 29) about how this program works, I decided to call to see whether the program did work off campus. I was greatly surprised it did, and I set an appointment with Simpson. He was very prompt in arriving and was very excited to take on the project of redoing my chimney.

A few weeks later, Simpson and seniors Darnell Hubbard and Dominic Stroud arrived to work on my project. The students were courteous and interested in learning the dynamics of the project. They kept the area clean and all did a great job. I am very pleased.

I highly recommend that Summit County residents give these students a chance to not only help you but to help themselves with their career choice and build confidence in themselves with a job well done.

As a former Copley school employee, I know our children need as much praise and accolades as possible. This builds their self-esteem and future work ethic.

Again, many thanks to Simpson, Hubbard and Stroud. I appreciate all you did.

Firestone High Jr. IB students get the credit on this project in conjunction with other IB high schools in Ohio. 

The goal was to raise $1,000 total statewide to purchase bikes for 6th graders in the town of Chinchero, Peru. The kids need the bikes to ride to a neighboring town to attend 7th grade to continue their education. Our kids raised $300.  One cupcake at a time.
 
The following IB Juniors at Firestone held 3 bake sales (and did all of the baking) to raise money for the project:

Nice work!, APS.  Brick by Brick
Or, yes, Virginia, we do have a masonry program…

Matt Simpson is an APS teacher.  He’s not just any teacher, though.  He is the 2013 Ohio ACTE Outstanding NEW Career and Technical Teacher. 

Matt Simpson graduated from the masonry program at Akron Public Schools awhile back.  Since, he has worked in the industry and traveled all over the world. He even applied his skill and talent to help build the beautiful glass block murals using glass adorning the New York subway system.

When Mr. Simpson heard that APS would have to close down its masonry program because we couldn’t find a teacher, he applied for the job.   Matt told us he wanted to give back to the program that gave him his amazing career…and boy, has he.

The program was struggling, low enrollment, lack of motivation and interest from students. In this his first year, and at Buchtel CLC, not only has he tackled the challenges of learning classroom management techniques, he is also assigned to teach a career cluster class.

Matt Simpson has created an amazing advisory committee of people from the industry who have given donations of materials, supplies and expert guest speakers.  

He created a skills contest and invited other regional schools for his students to practice masonry skills against in friendly competition.  Oh.  And one of his projects won.
 
Another star teacher.  Another great program.  APS.

http://www.akronschools.com/news/news_detail.dot?id=15a4d7e4-b300-43c7-b017-0f926c63ea73, Still lots of questions from our FB family about the playground equipment at Voris Elementary not being moved or 'recycled'.  

Keep in mind, you can always call the communications office at 761 2930 with your questions.  But, for purposes of answering the many here on FB...here goes:

The Voris playground equipment that was demolished was originally located at the old Fairlawn building (now Resnick).  

The equipment was installed there in 1993.  It was moved from Fairlawn to Voris in 2005 because the new Voris was being constructed, and the playground area for the building was used for new construction.

It became more worthwhile to relocate it, even though Voris CLC was being constructed at the same time as the new Resnick, since we were goin to use old Voris for swing space in the future.  

Given its age and ever changing safety standards, we did not feel comfortable re using that equipment., APS has so much new news...great students and teachers doing amazing things; opportunities for young women who love engineering, and more..right here...today....

Firestone High performing arts students will be taking part in an innovative program at Quaker Square March 22 from 8 til noon.

This involves AMHA and Akron Public Schools doing a role reversal program about poverty.

AMHA provides clients, about 20, who will play the role of various non-profit administrators.   Twenty-five APS psychologists and 45 APS counselors will play the role of families dealing with poverty and trying to navigate the social service system.

The 45 kids from Firestone will play the children in poverty as part of the families dealing with the difficulties of being in poverty trying to find assistance.

Akron School for the Arts to Present Monty Python’s Spamalot
 
Hysterical Musical Lovingly Ripped Off from “Monty Python and the Holy Grail”
  
Firestone Theatre is set to find its grail as part of the hysterical musical Monty Python’s Spamalot:

Starting at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 6, 2013,  performances continue at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 7, Friday, March 8, and Saturday, March 9, 2013. 

A single matinee performance will be held at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 9, 2013.

Advanced tickets for Monty Python’s Spamalot are $8.00. At-the-door tickets are $10.00. Reserved VIP tickets are $14.00 and include full access to the VIP room on the night of performance. 

You may purchase tickets in advance by mail using a form available at FirestoneTheatre.com or by visiting BrownPaperTickets.com. 

Tickets will be available at the door for each performance.
Tickets are also available for a special spaghetti dinner to be held between performances on Saturday, March 9, 2013. 

This delicious dinner is offered at a low cost with special prices for singles ($7.00), doubles ($12.00), and a family of four ($20.00). 

The dinner is served in two seating at 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. A selection of delicious pie slices is also available at small additional cost. All proceeds from the spaghetti dinner benefit the FHS Stage Parent booster group.
 
Monty Python’s Spamalot is lovingly ripped off from the classic film comedy “Monty Python and the the Holy Grail.” The hilarious musical retells the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table and features a bevy of beautiful show girls, not to mention cows, killer rabbits, and French people.

The Akron School for the Arts is a nationally recognized visual and performing arts institution of the Akron Public Schools. It is located on the campus of Firestone High School at 333 Rampart Avenue, Akron. Call 330-873-3408 for ticket information.
