格雷伯爵奶茶中的伯爵红茶是中国的祁门红茶或正山小种为茶基，或再配以锡兰红茶等茶，在其中加入香柠檬油的一种调味茶。正山小种是中国最古老的红茶品种而香柠檬则在意大利南部广泛种植。由于正山小种本身是利用松針薰香，而倫敦的水質含較多石灰，所以為了更加凸显其香味，格雷家选择使用香柠檬調味。英国人在日常生活中，伯爵茶几乎是每日必喝的茶饮

英国风味，香型典雅尊贵，显现王者之风，味道层层递进
今天就来日出茶太尝试一杯英国风味伯爵奶茶吧！

＃WhenBostonMeetsLondon #EarlGreyMIlkTea #ChatimeBoston, [Chatime Milk Tea Interesting Fact]

Earl Grey Milk Tea is a black tea based milk tea blend with a distinctive citrus flavor and aroma derived from the addition of oil extracted from the rind of the bergamot orange, a fragrant citrus fruit. The bergamot orange brings a distinct aroma and refreshing taste to the tea. According to the Grey family, the tea was specially blended by a Chinese mandarin for Lord Grey, to suit the water at Howick Hall, the family seat in Northumberland, using bergamot in particular to offset the preponderance of lime in the local water.

Don't miss it and let us know how you feel about it!, [The Origin of Earl Grey Milk Tea]

Do you know the story of the popular Earl Grey Tea? According to one legend, the British Prime Minister back in the Victorian Era, Charles Grey of Howick Hall, learned an ancient tea mixed system during a mission in China. He then brought this set of tea system back to England and taught it to a tea shop owner, Jackson. After the improvement made by Jackson, the tea was formed and named “Earl Grey Tea” to honor Lord Grey. Today, Earl Grey Milk Tea that is made based on Earl Grey Tea is popular around the world and became one of the most famous milk tea. 

你知道关于伯爵茶的传说吗？据说，在维多利亚时期，英国的一位大臣格雷伯爵在出访中国期间学会了一种古老的红茶混合制法。当格雷伯爵回到英国以后，他把学会的这个古老制法传授了给开红茶店的一位好友杰克森。经过杰克森的改良后，形成了今日闻名的伯爵茶。为了纪念格雷伯爵，改良后的茶被命名了伯爵红茶，而已伯爵红茶制作的奶茶则成为今日饱受欢迎的伯爵奶茶。

Come and try our Earl Grey Milk Tea at Chatime this summer, and have a taste of London in Boston. Don't forget our free samples start tomorrow until this Sunday!
