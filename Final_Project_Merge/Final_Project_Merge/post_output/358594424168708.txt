One more glitter card and I plan on sending smoking bags of dog poo to all those glitter sending jackasses.

Hopefully you are enjoying your holiday season ‚Äì The office holiday parties are in full swing.  Went to a great one at the Blue Water Grill this week.  I have been there many times for dinner and the food is always terrific.  They put together a nice holiday party too.  

Attended another event at a small Italian place down in the Village called Volare (on West 3rd I think) ‚Äì Old school Italian.  Place was packed.  The Hot and Cold Antipasto were probably the best I have ever had.  Shrimp and Lobster cooked perfectly.  The main dishes were ok ‚Äì Mushroom sauce should be a sauce and not mushrooms put on top of cream.  The chicken dishes looked fantastic.  All in all it was a great time and I plan on going back after the holidays to check it out again

I am tipper (and not just tipping the scales during this festive holiday season).  I am sometimes at a loss for what may be appropriate during the holidays along with what the right amount or gift should be.  If you live in a building in Manhattan you have your: Supers, Porters, Doormen, Cleaners, Parking Attendants, Delivery people, Waiters & Waitresses from a favorite restaurant‚Ä¶.With great services comes‚Ä¶.a lot of tipping.  I am sure that if you live in a place where grass grows‚Ä¶you have to tip your gardener.  We don‚Äôt have that issue so much in Manhattan.  No grass‚Ä¶No tip.
So where do you tip the scales of giving?  Who do you tip? Do you tip at all?  Share your ideas ‚Äì Would love to hear them, Oh no.  The pantless drunk santas brought mrs clause along for the ride and boy are they Hoe Hoe Hoes, So festive....the city is full of drunk santa s...and some with no pants. Happy holidays.

Have fun with the Molestation Pat Downs or the X-Ray Radiation Booths.  I will be roaming the streets of Manhattan, while you are gone, going from restaurant to restaurant in preparation of the big day.  I prepare for Thanksgiving like most people prepare for a marathon‚Ä¶I try and bulk up before the big day.  Tonight we go with a High-Carb Pasta meal and tomorrow‚Ä¶I am thinking steak.  I should be at fighting weight by the time Thursday (or I) roll around.  Only thing I have to be careful of is eating too much early in the day on Thanksgiving.   It has been known to happen‚Ä¶you start eating too soon and by the time dinner comes‚Ä¶you are already stuffed.  Pace yourselves‚Ä¶we are in it for the long haul.  This isn‚Äôt a sprint ‚Äì It‚Äôs a long distance race.  Eat Up New York., Yamine Bouhachicha, should you be on the phone while you are driving me in your cab?

You could be covered from head to toe and have the largest umbrella on the planet‚Ä¶you are going to get wet.  And there really should be lessons for people with Umbrellas.  They make you take Drivers Education to get your license‚Ä¶you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to carry an umbrella in the city without taking a course‚Ä¶It won‚Äôt help everyone,  because some folks are just beyond help, but it may help some people.  And I still enjoy watching the tourists in rain.  They are so disoriented that they can‚Äôt figure out how to get through a flooded cross walk.  Should they walk through it with their farmer ted boots?  Should they walk around it?  Or should they just stand there and make it impossible for everyone else to get around them?  Unfortunately for the Natives‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all of the above.
And best of luck with an umbrella you buy off the street - That should last.....ok its probably broken already - Just throw it away., Well at least the elections are over and now my tv ads can return to the normal junk.  And I heard a rumor yesterday that the world series was over.  Without there being any NY representation I can't say I even knew it was going on.
  Brace yourself manhattan....the holiday season is upon us., Why is it that there is always plenty of money to run political ads?  Why is making a choice no longer about the best candidate but about the one that sucks less than the other?   Can't wait for today to be over and for these awful ads to come to an end...then the politicians can get back to prepare for their next election while taking a paycheck from us, http://eatupnewyork.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/tourist-obstacle-course-to-a-bleecker-street-oasis-with-fried-rice/

www.suzisrestaurant.com, I love seeing all the kids head off to school in their Halloween costumes - They are everywhere - On the Buses, the subways and in the streets - Pure excitement for them - And the costumes are getting more and more creative.

There is of course the exception. In this case Meridiana Restaurant at 2756 Broadway (Between 105th & 106th St).  Upon walking into the dining room, you should know that the space was built almost entirely by the proprietor Giovanni (his real name). The bar and the d√©cor offer an Art deco/Roman palazzo kind of vibe. Enjoying a glass of wine while sitting at the end of the bar, looking out onto Broadway, always makes me feel like a New Yorker.    If I recall correctly Giovanni was born in the region of Palermo, Sicily, and the dishes he oversees carry an authentic Sicilian flavor. Giovanni personally overseas all purchases for his establishment and operates his restaurant with the brilliance of a Maestro, personally directing each aspect of the day. I have known Giovanni since he immigrated to America in the early 90‚Äôs. His story is truly fascinating I recall that en route to America he ended up working somewhere in Africa, describing his time there as ‚Äúhell like‚Äù, working long hours and sleeping infrequently. My love and admiration for Giovanni is twofold.  One, he is a shining example of the American dream -  He came to America with only the clothes on his back (like so many of our ancestors) and built an excellent reputation as one of New York‚Äôs leading restaurateurs. The second reason that I love him is because he runs one of the cleanest kitchens in New York City (not such and easy task). Like every good Italian (American) boy, I demand a clean kitchen, and Meridiana delivers, no matter when I go in, the kitchen is spotless (my chosen career allows me unlimited access to just about any kitchen in Manhattan). I cannot enjoy a meal unless I know that the kitchen is the best it could be, kind of an OCD thing I have going. When you go, you will find the food to be plentiful, yet not pretentious on any level. The restaurant is run with a family friendly atmosphere with a wait staff that will make you feel like you belong. Giovanni and his family make this place the Uptown success that it is. Eat Up New York!You can find the menu at: http://www.menupages.com/restaurants/meridiana, I have eaten at some of the most hyped restaurants in the city.  Places where you pay $95 for a Kobe Grass Fed Steak, and even the smallest of drinks is going to cost you $20 a pop.  I find those places interesting but not very realistic.  I get the whole charging of astronomical prices, especially in a city where you are paying astronomical rent‚Ä¶.The major problem will always be that if you want to charge me an arm and a leg for my meal then it better blow me away every single time.  I can handle an off meal when I don‚Äôt have to give up a kidney to pay for it.  I have no patience, and will never return, to a place that has a giant price tag and fails to deliver‚Ä¶..even once.  I get that you want to play in the pro‚Äôs but then you don‚Äôt get the luxury of having a minor league day.  Not here ‚Äì Not in this town ‚Äì Never in New York.
Now that I have completed my Sunday morning tirade‚Ä¶two Jet Fuel Coffees into the morning ‚Äì I want to tell you about the opposite of a $95 steak ‚Äì Other planet opposite.  How about a $5.75 burger served on a paper plate ‚Äì On a table that has names and other nondescript thing carved on top - Where your shoes may stick to the floor and you may have to wait in line just to get a seat‚Ä¶.You got it‚Ä¶Corner Bistro.  It is what is and that is exactly what I like about it.   Talk about having the luxury to have an off night.  At under $10, for an entire meal, I am ok with several bad experiences‚Ä¶.but you won‚Äôt have one here.  Sure I have read some unpleasant reviews from folks over the years but I think that is more because their expectations were larger than the reality.  The Corner Bistro does not profess to being the Gramercy Tavern.  It has no interest in hanging out with Tom Collicchio.  This is a great old bar with a simple menu and consistent food.  It is what it is and I admire them for keeping it real.  If you feel too old going to this place‚Ä¶then you are.  I certainly wouldn‚Äôt bring my parents there.  They wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it, they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate it, and they would ruin it for me. 
I would also suggest an afternoon trip for a more quiet experience.  If you feel like going late on a Friday or Saturday night then prepare to wait on line‚Ä¶.and stop your bitching.  It‚Äôs your own fault.  Don‚Äôt get pissy that you don‚Äôt think it was worth the wait ‚Äì This place isn‚Äôt for you.  There are hundreds of overpriced pretentious slop houses just waiting for you to line up for ‚Äì Keep em and leave my Corner Bistro alone.
http://cornerbistrony.com/index.php, I eat out‚Ä¶try not to hide your surprise. Living in New York City your choices for eating out are endless. You can probably eat at a different place every single day, and never hit the same place twice. Even though I tend to go back to the same places over and over again I do try to bust out on occasion. This isn‚Äôt going to be one of those times‚Ä¶and rightfully so.

Greenwich Village‚Ä¶the Village for the natives, is a treasure trove of restaurants, cafes, shops, stores, and on a Saturday‚Ä¶.a hot mess of walking tours for out of towners. There are old time bars and comedy clubs and the streets can feel like Mardi Gras on a weekend night. One of my all time favorites is an old school Italian Restaurant located at 181 Thompson Street ‚Äì Rocco‚Äôs Restaurant.

Rocco‚Äôs has the feel of an old time cafe. It isn‚Äôt a giant place and actually seems to take up two small store fronts which are connected. The chairs and tables are old school and even though you are close to your neighbors you don‚Äôt feel like you are sitting on top of anyone. They laid out the space as effectively as possible so you do feel some sense of privacy even though you could reach out and slap your neighbor.

The heart of the place is the staff. This is old school and old time Italian Restaurant at it‚Äôs best. It always brings back memories of my folks taking me out to their favorite local Italian restaurant. There are hugs and handshakes ‚Äì Always a warm greeting that never has that typical phony NY Concierge feel.

The food is consistently fantastic with a menu that offers plenty to choose from. Their pasta is always fresh and their sauce just warms my heart. I have been all around the menu and never found anything that I didn‚Äôt like. From seafood to Meat to Pasta‚Ä¶.It just brings a smile to my face. It‚Äôs even a place you could bring your kids‚Ä¶if you wanted to. Rocco‚Äôs is always accommodating to making a chicken parmesan or just some plain spaghetti for the kids. They couldn‚Äôt be nicer.

I know there are tons of places to choose from and there is always that new hip restaurant that opens up‚Ä¶I always find myself coming back to the places that feel like home and Rocco‚Äôs Restaurant is one of those places. http://www.roccorestaurant.com, I have to give a shout out to one of my favorite places in Brooklyn‚Ä¶Linger Cafe & Lounge which can be found on Atlantic Avenue (533 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, NY). Linger is a very comfortable place that feels like you are sitting in someones living room. Maybe a little like an old time speakeasy ‚Äì Plush chairs and couches that scream for you to sit down. A home away from home. A perfect place for a romantic date or great place to sit and relax with a group of friends. Make no mistake ‚Äì This isn‚Äôt a bar and you won‚Äôt find Sunday‚Äôs game playing on the TV ‚Äì There are tons of places for that and they usually smell of stale beer. Linger is some place special

The lighting in Linger is an architectural marvel‚Ä¶and it really is‚Ä¶I was told that the designer of the lighting fixture (which takes up the entire ceiling) won an award for their work. And the owner couldn‚Äôt be more lovely ‚Äì You can tell that she puts her heart and soul into Linger and the food that she so delicately prepares. And don‚Äôt miss the Grilled Cheese or Tuna Melt‚Ä¶.I am salivating just thinking about them.

My only complaint‚Ä¶.is that Linger Cafe is in Brooklyn. Wish Linger was in Manhattan because I would be there more often. If you are in Brooklyn‚Ä¶.this is a place worth stopping for ‚Äì Kick back‚Ä¶have a drink. You won‚Äôt want to leave‚Ä¶I guess hence the name‚Ä¶.LINGER‚Ä¶.I tell you, nothing gets past me these days!
http://www.lingercafe.com, If you live in New York City you have certainly run across your location Green Market.  They are fantastic places with unbelievable products and reasonable prices.  People, who live outside of the city, often comment at how expensive Manhattan can be.  And yes it can be; however you can also learn to shop outside of the box a bit in order to save quite a bit of money.  If you keep all of your shopping to the big box supermarkets you may not always get the best deals.  If you learn how to shop in different places, for different things, then you can likely have it all ‚Äì Best products at reasonable prices. The Farmer‚Äôs Markets really are great places.  There are different booths for products that range from: Fruits, Vegetables, Fish, Meat, Flowers, Bread, Wine and even composting.  Besides the fact that everything is super fresh, the prices are reasonable.  My advice is bring your own roll up bags and fill them up as you purchase items from around the market.   And by the way‚Ä¶one of the secrets behind some of the greatest restaurants in NYC is that they shop at their local green markets.  You can get the same great items for your kitchen that you might find on the menu‚Äôs of your favorite restaurants!Ok ‚Äì Now the New Yorker in me can‚Äôt help but mention some very annoying facts about the Farmer‚Äôs Markets (and the city in general) ‚Äì It has to do with the tourists/out of towners who like to stoll through our local Farmer‚Äôs Markets.  First of all‚Ä¶some of you live in places where they grow stuff‚Ä¶.If you are from Idaho I am sure you have seen potatatos grow.  Why on earth do you come to our local farmers markets to take pictures of fruits and vegetable that grow in your hometown?  Do I come to your corn field to take family photos?  Not so much.  And not to mention that the locals are trying to shop‚Ä¶.having tourists eat up the valuable, and limited, space at these farmers markets is absurd.  They aren‚Äôt even buying anything ‚Äì so not only are they annoying to the shoppers, but they are also taking away from the vendors who are trying to sell their goods.  Maybe we could devise a roped off area where tourists can stand and photograph New Yorkers in their natural habitat?  Best time for the Markets is early morning, first thing, while the tourists are still in their hotels waiting in line at the breakfast buffet.If you haven‚Äôt found them before ‚Äì Check out this site for information: http://www.grownyc.org/, It's a long weekend in the big city and we don't want to freak you out all at once.  Let's start off slow....get to know each other.  Like a date before the date.  (if are thinking this is a similar to the pre-shirt...then you need to leave this site asap....please don't even ask why I know about it.....:)
So....starting off slow.  How about coffee.  But not just any coffee.  This is something special.  Something unique.  Check out www.roastingplant.com.  Better yet.  Go there - they have 2 locations but my favorite is at: 75 Greenwich Avenue
New York, NY - Its across from the former St. Vincent's Hospital.  
These folks roast it, grind it and brew it right on the spot.  The place is like the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory for coffee lovers.   Start at the roastingplant and then check back in here for our next date.)
