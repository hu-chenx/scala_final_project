#farmersmarket #farmtotable #coffee #freshroastedcoffee, Light roast vs bold dark roast... which has more caffeine?? 

The answer is light roast! It may sound counterintuitive but a lighter roasted bean contains more caffeine than its darker bold counterpart. Since it's roasted for a shorter period of time, most of the caffeine and oils remain intact in the bean. The beans are light brown in color and have no oils on its surface. The flavor will also be more fruity and lighter tasting. 

So remember, if you need to maximize your caffeine the morning, try our light roasted drip coffee.  Ask us for a sample or to even show you the beans... Interesting huh!

#coffeeshop #bostonsmallbusiness #localroaster #rainforestalliance #smallbusiness #westroxbury #boston #ilovecoffee #lattelove, We conclude our "Origin Trip" recap with the third exciting and insightful day with our guests from Mountain Bird Coffee and Tea Company, MaMa Jean's Natural Market and IDK? CAFE.

Day 3:
Having forged lasting memories and shared valuable experiences, we say our goodbyes to the farm after another traditional Nicaraguan breakfast of gallo pinto, a dish made with beans and rice, nacatamals and coffee!

On our way to Managua, Nicaragua's capital, we visit a market in Jinotega, to shop among the locals. It's a four hour drive to Managua, so you can be sure we stocked up! Once in the capital, the entire El Recreo family was graciously invited by Steve and Rhonda, the owners of Mountain Bird Coffee and Tea Company, to a wonderful dinner. 

We have so much to be thankful for, it is our pleasure to be able to give back to the farm and strengthen our relationships with our partners, an opportunity provided by our Origin Trip. We left with stories to tell, friendships made and a hopeful and excited outlook for 2016's harvest! 

Whether at the cafe or on the farm, the only thing we love more than our coffee is being able to share with you the story behind it!

Thank you all!, Micronutrients are required by the body in small amounts, they are critical to development, disease prevention and overall quality of life. However, they are not found in the body and can only be introduced via diet. 

Don't worry, we've got you covered, our single origin coffee contains numerous micronutrients like potassium, magnesium and niacin. 

Come in for your medicine! #coffeelife #singleorigin #dailybrew #westroxbury #boston #rainforestalliance #sustainable, To make our cold brew, we soak our bold beans in cold water for 18 hours before serving. This creates a smooth taste. We make this year round.  #singleorigin #coldbrew #localroaster #rainforestalliance #westroxbury #elrecreocoffee #welovecoffee #boston #sunshineandcoffee #arabica #nicaragua, We rejoin our "Origin Trip" recap on day 2.  Please let us know if you would like more information on this experience for yourself.

Day 2:
We awoke for our first full day on the farm to the sounds of 200 tortillas being pressed out by hand by our amazing cook.  Yes...200 of them - every morning, for every worker! "The sounds and smells are so nostalgic for me growing up on the farm." - Miriam

The harvesting process kicked off today. Our guests toured the wet mills, dry mills, patios and the rest of the farm. We learned first hand how to pick the coffee berries from the very best. For some fun, we held a small competition with our guests to see who was the best coffee picker!!  --- Needless to say, there is no doubt who the pros are!!

After harvesting we head over to the children's school to share the donations our Boston cafe customers and guests generously provided.  El Recreo's mission is to take care of our workers and this includes their children, creating an educational environment and a sense of community.  

We get a great sense of satisfaction seeing physical improvements that have been made to the schools since our last visit.  The advancements don't end with the children, the structures that house the workers have also undergone major upgrades!   

We end the day touring more of the farm and enjoying the beautiful mountainous landscapes with a delicious dinner and head to bed early.

--- check back next week for day 3 ---, null, We will be at a farmers market in Cambridge today from 10-2pm. http://www.cambridgewinterfarmersmarket.com/, We are counting down to our 1 year anniversary - 21 days to go!

-- Saturday Feb 13th & Sunday Feb 14th --, Thank you so much!  Hope to see you again soon. https://t.co/CLNrUQOb3F, Did you know we offer "Origin Trips" to our family farm in Jinotega, Nicaragua? Near the end of 2015 we took our friends at Mountain Bird Coffee and Tea Company, MaMa Jean's Natural Market and IDK? CAFE. This hands on experience is the best way to truly understand where our coffee comes from and take part in our coffee production process.

Day 1:  
El Recreo owners, the Ferrey family (Miriam Morales family), arrived a day early to prepare for visiting guests.

Upon arrival, they met the extended El Recreo family over a delicious traditional Nicaraguan lunch of Caballo Bayo consisting of: mashed beans, chop chicken meat, chopped meat, sausage, guacamole (avocado, cooked egg), pico de gallo salad, sour cream, cheese, chicharron.

After eating, we took our guests on a tour of the main area, where they saw just what "Coffee with Social Responsibility" really means. The school, chapel, clinic, stores, kitchen, hostel, technical school and mill, all have benefited from El Recreo's community involvement and financial support, made possible through our valued customers and wholesale purchasers.

Our busy day ended with a big celebration to mark the season's opening harvest. Every farm worker and their family also attended, where staples of Nicaraguan cuisine were served.  Traditional Nacatamales were a favorite! 

We didn't party too late into the evening though, tomorrow's day began bright and early, when harvesting kicks off at 6 AM!
