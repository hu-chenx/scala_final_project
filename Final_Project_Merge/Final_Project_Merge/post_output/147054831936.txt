Come on down to #PorterSquare and watch on one of our 20 HD TV's!, Every Tuesday is Half Price Burger Day at #TavernInTheSquare  #PorterSquare #Cambridge There have been many claims about the origin of the hamburger. The earliest known report in a newspaper is from July 5, 1896, when the Chicago Daily Tribune made a highly specific claim regarding a "hamburger sandwich" in an article about a "Sandwich Car": "A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range. The hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher David. White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase. However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as "the innovation of a food vendor on the pike". No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. It is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country. #CowboyBurger #Bacon, It's a celebration!  and we want YOU to be apart of this awesome #FIFAWWC Final tonight!  

Gear up and meet us at Porter Sq!

#4thofjuly #holidayweekend, 4th Of July Trivia Facts 2015: 
15 Fun Things To Know About Independence Day

 1. How many people signed the Declaration of Independence on July Fourth?    Answer - Two.

2. What day did most signers of the Declaration of Independence actually sign the document?  Answer - Aug. 2, 1776.

3. Did you know which president was born on July 4? 
Answer - It was Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president, in 1872.

4. Which three presidents died on the Fourth of July: 
Answer - They were three of the first five presidents: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe. The second president, Adams, and the third, Jefferson, both died in 1826, the 50th anniversary.

5. Most of the Founding Fathers agreed that July Fourth is the correct day to celebrate America‚Äôs independence from Great Britain -- except one. Who is it and why? 
Answer - Adams thought July 2, the day the Second Continental Congress voted in Philadelphia to declare independence from Britain, would be the day patriots celebrated. ‚ÄúThe Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America,‚Äù Adams wrote on July 3. ‚ÄúIt ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.

6. When did the Fourth of July become a legal federal holiday? 
Answer - 1870. Then, in 1938, Congress reaffirmed the holiday to make sure all workers received full pay.

7. Is there something written on the back of the Declaration of Independence?  
Answer -Yes! It‚Äôs said the following is written upside down and backwards:  ‚ÄúOriginal Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776.‚Äù It‚Äôs not known who wrote it, or when. In Revolutionary War years, parchment was rolled up, so this probably served as a message.

8. The Nathan‚Äôs Fourth of July Hot Dog Contest has become an annual tradition. How did it start? 
Answer -It‚Äôs a pretty cute story: Legend has it that four immigrants got into an argument over who was most patriotic. To prove themselves, they ate as many hot dogs as they could handle -- because nothing says America like excess.

9. America isn‚Äôt the only nation that celebrates the Fourth of July. Which other countries do, and why? 
Answer -It might sound odd, but if you celebrate the Fourth of July outside the U.S., you still might see fireworks in Denmark, England, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. This is because thousands of people emigrated to the U.S. in the early 1900s. Some European celebrations on the Fourth take place near tourist destinations -- to attract U.S. travelers -- or near American military bases.

10. When were fireworks first used to celebrate July Fourth? 
Answer -1777. Congress chose fireworks as a way to celebrate the first anniversary. They were ignited over Philadelphia. The celebration also included bonfires and bells.

11. How many people lived in the U.S. when the Declaration was signed?
Answer -2.5 million.

12. What baseball player threw a 4-0 no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox on July 4, 1983?
Answer -New York Yankees pitcher Dave Righetti. It was the first no-hitter in 27 years.

13. Which newspaper first printed the Declaration of Independence? 
Answer -The Pennsylvania Evening Post

14. Which president first held a Fourth of July celebration at the White House?
Answer -Thomas Jefferson

15. Which country gained independence from the United States on July Fourth? 
Answer -The Philippines did in 1946.

But my weather forecast, you cannot contradict.
That's not a football lying beside me
It's my shadow you see
So, six more weeks of winter it shall be!
