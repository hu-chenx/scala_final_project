ABOUT THE CAM NEELY FOUNDATION FOR CANCER CARE The Cam Neely Foundation for Cancer Care was launched in 1995 by Cam Neely after the passing of his parents, Marlene and Michael Neely, from cancer. This experience created the inspiration to help others living with cancer. With the dream of honoring his beloved parents and the hope of helping others, The Cam Neely Foundation for Cancer Care was created to help cancer patients and their families. As millions of Americans will be diagnosed this year with some form of cancer, an understandable sense of urgency propels the Foundation's mission. Located in Boston, Massachusetts, The Cam Neely Foundation for Cancer Care is a support- driven 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides comfort, support and hope to cancer patients and their families through initiatives and programs sustained by donations. Since its inception, the Foundation has raised nearly $28 million from donations of all sizes, impacted countless cancer patients and their families and to dedicate themselves to sustaining The Neely House and The Cancer fund which assists with designing, funding, and completing construction projects that will deliver immediate and tangible results in the Cancer Center of Tufts Medical Center.

We are endeavoring to raise funds to help the families of the deceased and the students still in hospital, some with life-altering injuries. We are seeking to help defray the cost of repatriating those who so tragically died and to assist with the expenses that will be incurred by the families of those injured, some of whom will have long stays in hospital in California.

Top-class Irish entertainment will be provided all day by some of Boston’s finest Irish musicians.

There will be raffles during the day with prizes including two U2 tickets

Todays history lesson: Long ago, the most important part of Shrovetide week (the whole celebration of the arrival of spring lasted one week) was making & eating pancakes. The hot, round pancakes symbolized the sun. It was believed that by eating pancakes, they received the power, light and warmth of the sun. The 1st pancake was usually put on a window for the spirits of the ancestors. On the last day of Shrovetide week pancakes were burnt in a bonfire as a sacrifice to the gods. Check out this New England Patriots pancake art. No sacrificing that to the gods!

FUN FACT OF THE DAY: Country singer Garth Brooks was born Troyal Garth Brooks on February 7, 1962, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Brooks got his start in music singing in bars and clubs while attending Oklahoma State University. In 1987, he moved to Nashville for the second time—his first attempt was unsuccessful—with his wife, Sandy, to try to make it in country music. With help from music manager Bob Doyle, Brooks eventually signed to Capitol Records.

See ya later @djsof617 http://t.co/9JiZuIrHQB, null, Even with the advent of the world’s craft beer revolution, there are certain classic brews that never lose their appeal. Guinness Stout is one of those.

Something about having a properly poured Guinness placed on the bar in front of you almost makes you feel like you’re drinking in Dublin, where Arthur Guinness began brewing in 1759. Though the stout now is brewed in nearly 60 countries, the slightly bitter concoction with its creamy nitrogen-infused head and notes of chocolate and coffee is the first image most folks have when they hear the term “dark beer.”

Now, Guinness has entered the light with its new Blonde American Lager.

The beer, made in Latrobe, Pennsylvania—original home of Rolling Rock pale lager—is the first in the planned Guinness Discovery Series. According to the brewery, the series is “a range of ‘fusion brew’ beers combining more than 255 years of European brewing expertise with global brewing experience in 55 countries.”

The Blonde American Lager uses the proprietary Guinness yeast along with crystal malt and American hops: Mosaic, Willamette, and Mount Hood.

It pours a deep, golden straw color. The head rises about half an inch in the glass, and quickly dissipates. The combination of hops introduces a noticeable but subtle floral and citrus aroma. The biscuit flavors from the malt remain consistent throughout, while the hoppiness seems to grow just a bit more pronounced after it rises a few degrees from refrigerator temperature.

As with most lagers, there are no flavors that will scare off the casual beer drinker, but hardcore beer geeks and fans of the more flavorful Guinness Stout might find this too tame for their palates. Regardless, it’s certainly clean and refreshing, but likely more suited for summertime drinking rather than the cold months that are approaching.

It will be interesting to see what’s next in the Guinness Discovery Series—and what color it is., There's something for everyone at The Grand Canal.

**In the 1800's liquor was a Beautician's secret!  Yes, rum was considered an excellent product for cleaning hair and keeping it healthy, and brandy was believed to strengthen the hair roots.
**No alcohol beverage can be over 190% proof (95% alcohol).  Because at any higher proof, the beverage will draw moisture from the air and self-dilute.
**In Medieval times, an alcohol beverage was often served with the English's breakfast.
**Old U.S. laws required that alcohol containers be concealed in public by being placed in paper bags or "packages" by liquor stores.  This gave us the names "package stores" that sell "package goods"., Don't forget about our great specials today

Fresh off their tour with The Dropkick Murphy's. 
Check them out. Going to be a great show., null, If Milwaukee went by any other nickname, Whiskey of the Damned frontman Eoin McCarthy may not have ended up here.

"My dad is a musician (Irish singer-songwriter and comedian Finbar McCarthy), and while we were living in Spain, we got a visa to come here," said McCarthy, a part-time landscaper and cook at the Anvil in Cedarburg and the Tracks. "When you immigrate to America, they give you a list of cities and their nicknames so you can declare where you're going. We looked at the list, and my mom said, 'Right, that's where we're going, Brewtown.'"

It's a good thing they did, because McCarthy established something special in Brewtown with Whiskey of the Damned.

With McCarthy fronting the live sets with bugged-out eyes and bulging neck veins, the Celtic rock quintet is reminiscent of the Pogues, Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphys. But it's no mere copycat. Its surprisingly versatile full-length debut, "Monsters Are Real," features melodic fiddle playing from Gina Romantini (who at 22, has already toured with the Wallflowers, the Doobie Brothers and Fountains of Wayne) and an aggressive rhythm section in Matt Schuetz and Andrew Weber that occasionally throbs like a metal band.

One baseball myth that just won't die is that the "World Series" was named for the New York World newspaper, which supposedly sponsored the earliest contests. It didn't, and it wasn't. 

In fact, the postseason series between the AL and NL champs was originally known as the "Championship of the World" or "World's Championship Series." That was shortened through usage to "World's Series" and finally to "World Series." 

This usage can be traced through the annual baseball guides. Spalding's Base Ball Guide for 1887 reported the results of the 1886 postseason series between Chicago, champions of the National League, and St. Louis, champions of the American Association, under the heading "The World's Championship." As the editor noted, the two leagues "both entitle their championship contests each season as those for the base ball championship of the United States," so a more grandiose name was required to describe the postseason showdown between the two "champions of the United States.", null, Did you indulge today?, Finally the announcement that was worth waiting for.

In the late 18th century, Cork was the largest exporter of butter in the world, mostly to Britain and the British Empire.
The Union Jack was flown for the very first time in Dublin on 1st January 1801 to herald the Union of Great Britain and Ireland.
The term 'boycott' comes from Captain Charles Boycott (1832-1897), the land agent of an absentee landlord from Ulster. In 1880, after refusing to reduce the rents of his employer's tenants, the Irish Land League decided to stop dealing with him. The whole community began to ostracise him to the point where even shops refused to serve him. The Times of London quickly came to use his name as a term for organized isolation, and the word entered the English language.
The world's first suburban commuter railway opened between Dublin and Dun Laoghaire in 1834 (two years before the London and Greenwich Railway).
On 9th July 1939, the Pan Am Clipper III left Botwood, Newfoundland, and landed the next day at Foynes, County Limerick. It was the first direct commercial passenger flight from America to Europe. For the next three years, the village of Foynes became the busiest civilian airport in the world, serving most flights from North America to Europe. Humphrey Bogart, Ernest Hemingway, John F. Kennedy and Eleanor Roosvelt all passed through Foynes Airport during WWII. Irish coffee is said to have been invented at Foynes in 1942 to cheer up passengers after a Pan Am flying boat was forced to turn back due to bad weather conditions. This golden age is commemorated in the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, on the site of the old airport. In 1942, Shannon Airport replaced Foynes as the gateway to America. It is also in Shannon that the world's first duty free opened on 21th April 1947. It served as a model for other duty free facilities worldwide., Tis that time of year again.... Stop by and try our famous Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner all this week., Where are you going to celebrate St. Patrick's day this year?, null, The Irish consume in average 131.1 liters of beer per year - the 2nd highest per-capita consumption after the Czech Republic.
Famous Irish breweries include Guinness, Smithwicks (Kilkenny), and Harp Lager.
The three most famous symbols of Ireland are the green Shamrock, the harp, and the Celtic cross.
Halloween traces back its origins to the Gaelic festival of Samhain, a harvest festival held on 31 October to mark the end of summer. Samhain became associated with All Saints (1 November) from the early Middle Ages and the two progressively merged over the centuries, creating Halloween.
88% of Irish citizens are nominally Roman Catholic. The Republic of Ireland has one of the highest rates of church attendance in the Western World (around 45% of regular Mass attendance).
The ancestral language of Irish people is Irish Gaelic. Nowadays 1.6 million people claim a self-reported competence in Irish, but only 380,000 fluent speakers remain.

Martin Luther King Day
Today is Martin Luther King Day! On this day we celebrate the life and legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who devoted his life to the pursuit of justice and equality for all.

President Ronald Reagan signed the King Holiday Bill into law on November 2, 1983—fifteen years after the assassination of the civil rights leader. A congressman from Michigan introduced the legislation just a few months after Dr. King’s death in 1968, but it took years of petitions, politics, and personal appeals from Coretta Scott King to get it passed.

Martin Luther King Day is celebrated every year on the third Monday in January. There are only two other federal holidays that honor individuals—Washington’s Birthday (also known as Presidents Day) and Columbus Day.

Today, take a moment to honor Dr. King’s work and reflect on his dream for America. Find out how you can participate in the national day of service and volunteer on Martin Luther King Day., Game Time

Long neck beer bottle, now empty!
Source: Kymberly Fergusson (nifwlseirff)
Beer alone is not what causes a beer belly. Eating and drinking more calories than are expended each day, is the primary cause of larger bellies.

Ever watched an advertisement for beer and wondered why the people don't just drink already? It's actually a US law that people cannot actually be shown consuming an alcoholic beverage on television! While there are countless commercials advertising their use, none have their actors consume the product. 

This is for several reasons. The first is when beer ads began to be featured on televisions, prohibition was just ending, and large companies feared viewers would find the consumption of alcohol too morally challenging. Thus, they refrained from showing anyone consuming alcohol. The second reason pertains to minors. When the drinking age was raised to 21, the government worried that too many minors would be brainwashed by ads depicting younger looking people drinking beer, thus they made it illegal to show anyone drinking at all!, It's Saturday night, the Bruins are in town and Cover Story are rocking The Canal at 10pm with DJ Sanga spinning the beats next door in Buskers.
