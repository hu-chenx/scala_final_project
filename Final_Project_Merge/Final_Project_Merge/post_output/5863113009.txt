Lemon tart, pine nut crust, Chantilly cream & lemon zest, Cure your own corned beef

My mother is 100% Irish so we grew up on corned beef and it was (still is) one of my favorite comfort foods anytime of year.  This year I am super excited for St. Patrick’s Day, it falls on Sunday so house cured corned beef will be this week’s Sunday Supper at Zebra’s Bistro.  With Chef Brendan Pelley curing this own, I just can’t wait.  If you want to make your own at home here is the recipe Chef Pelley uses (originally adapted from chef and cookbook author Michael Ruhlman).  While you can “corn” any cut of beef the most common is the brisket, but any cut your butcher has available can be corned.

1-1/2 cups kosher salt
½ cup sugar
4 teaspoons pink salt (if you can find it)
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 tablespoons pickling spice (see below)
5-pound beef brisket
2 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
2 medium onion, peeled and quartered
1 celery stalk, roughly chopped.
In pot large enough to hold brisket, combine 1 gallon of water with kosher salt, sugar, garlic and 2 tablespoons pickling spice. Bring to a simmer, stirring until salt and sugar are dissolved. 
Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled.

Place brisket in brine, weighted with a plate to keep it submerged; cover. Refrigerate for 5 days.

Remove brisket from brine and rinse thoroughly. Place in a pot just large enough to hold it. Cover with water and add remaining pickling spice, carrot, onion and celery. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer gently until brisket is fork-tender, about 3 hours, adding water if needed to cover brisket.

Keep warm until ready to serve. Meat can be refrigerated for several days in cooking liquid. Reheat in the liquid or serve chilled. Slice thinly and serve on a sandwich or with additional vegetables simmered until tender in the cooking liquid.
Pickling Spice is equal parts black peppercorns, cloves, ginger, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, hot red pepper flakes, allspice berries and ground mace, a couple of cinnamon sticks and bay leaves, crumbled, Chef Pelley's asparagus & spinach salad with pickled red onion, bacon balsamic vinaigrette & Chip-in Farm egg on our new Spring menu!, Todd Ruggere had a beer here at Zebra's to cure cancer!

http://ticketderby.com/vendor/craig-neubecker-id-629, That should have read Justin Abrams' garden, Visited garden today. More of a minifarm than our kitchen garden (they have 3 restaurants). I would think that mote restaurant would be growing at least some of their produce like we do. But it can be s lot of work if you don't love it like we do., This week our kitchen garden is providing us with several type of heirloom tomatoes, zucchini, summer squash, chives, mint, lemon balm, sage, and oregano - love the garden fresh produce this time if year (and all 100% organic), null, null, What is happening in your garden?  We are harvesting like crazy.

Our kitchen garden is exploding with crops.  The lettuce continues to thrive and every day now we are shocked at the new summer squash, zucchini.  And the herbs keep providing us with the freshest possible clipping., Did you see us on Fox TV this morning?  They did a “Zip Trip” to Medfield and a segment on Zebra’s Bistro.  I haven’t seen it yet.  If I get a clip I will post it., Spring is coming – I just know it

The first signs of spring in our kitchen garden are showing.  The chives and the rhubarb told me so this morning as they are already pushing through the cold soil., Try it out.  Deconstructed Guinness stout ice cream sundae, with caramel sauce, spiced pecans and whipped cream.  (yes we have it on the menu tonight and for at least the next week or so, then who knows...), This is what we are thinking about today...

It's so much fun to play with our food.  I'll let you know how it turns out (but we are getting very excited!!!!

What do you think?, Here is a photo of the “Pearl on Torch” that I commented on in the post below.  It is seared white tuna, on a bed of cucumber and tiny horseradish with thin cut scallion, flying fish roe and spicy ponzu.  Yumm…, This is the stuff foodies get excited about

Dragon Ball and Flower, a salmon sphere filled with salmon tartare, crab, cucumber, mixed with a bit of tempura crunch and a tuna flower, and a touch of spicy house sauce, I can feel it…

We can almost see it…

And Spring means the garden – I can’t wait.

I can just start to see the outline of my kitchen garden hidden under all that melting snow.  I am getting so excited I can almost taste the spring lettuces already., Can you please do me a quick favor?  I am no pro at facebook, and in the past few days a few of our guests told me that even though they are fans of Zebra’s on facebook they are only seeing our posts when then click over to our page or when then get our emails.  If you are getting this please let me know, even just a quick reply would help me understand what is going on… thanks in advance, Yumm… lobster and black mission fig pizza

, Sugar maple give up your sap, Where dose your food come from?  Fishing, gardening, and bee keeping; where our food comes from is a bit of a hobby. This afternoon  my daughter and I tapped a sugar maple for maple syrup at Moose Hill Mass Audubon (yes we are eager for spring). Earlier in the year my son and I helped chop and stack the fire wood for the sugar shack. We plan to work the sugar shack next month.  Can't wait., null, null)
