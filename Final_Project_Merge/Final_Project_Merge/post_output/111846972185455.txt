The staff and I just finished our tasting of her 3 specialty flavor collaboration with Down River Ice Cream!!!  All 3 are now available here, to perfectly complete your dining experience.  Down River makes their beautiful frozen custard from scratch, making them a cut above the rest.

Hog Island - Rich Chocolate Ice Cream with Kim's Dark Chocolate Organic Gluten Free Brownies folded in.

White River Junction - A Very Creamy Vanilla Custard Ice Cream with luscious swirls of Salted Carmel and of course her Organic Gluten Free Dark Chocolate Brownie Chunks layered thru out.

Happy Birthday - A Simple Vanilla Icecream with lots of Fun RainBow Sprinkles and her Organic Gluten Free Deviled Foods Cake chunks.

This is a great summer addition to Kim's already amazing dessert list, that we SO proudly feature. 

Cheers
