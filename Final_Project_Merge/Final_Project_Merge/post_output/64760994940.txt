http://knightmovesboston.wordpress.com/2013/12/04/featured-game-kill-doctor-lucky/, Featured Knight Moves Decor: Gramophone.

We love smart ideas at Knight Moves, and we like to integrate it into our style. You might miss it if your not looking closely, but the music we run in our little Cafe comes from a Gramophone, and here's the trick: it doesn't run off electricity.

Our gramophone uses the science of acoustics to amplify the sound off a small device (like an iPhone) and fill a room with music. No extra power needed, the gramophone tech is strictly analog. Just like board games, you don't need to be plugged in to have a good time.

That's what we like at Knight Moves, stylish and smart., Our best wishes to Girard, the College Senior writing an essay about us for his business class.
