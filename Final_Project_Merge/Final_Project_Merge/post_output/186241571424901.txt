The whole wedding has their L's up on the most special day in that couples lives, that's something I am grateful to witness. #laceup, Fan Friday: do I spy a Cleveland browns jersey next to the Lace Up tatt?, I feel like I'll read one bad comment at the wrong time and it just sets me off and my rebuttal comes across the wrong way. Lesson #1 I just learned: don't pay attention to the minor negativity when there is a plethora of positivity surrounding us. Lesson #2 I just learned: try and love everyone even if they have no desire to reciprocate it back. And love you for you in the process!! Lesson #3: ima shut the fuck up and go rap. have a positive day! (We can all improve ourselves a little more everyday. Me included. Lace up), Fan Friday: this is what it's all about right here.

I stood on the same carpet and in the same room of the people I look up to and just soaked the vibes in. This next album will be a great one. I can feel it.

Print a real muthafucka, someone with an actual opinion, someone who actually stands for something. Anything you put my face in, my fans will buy - anything that tries to stop our movement from growing, our fans will burn. Just thought I'd share that. Lace up., TBT: this was from a photoshoot and interview we did for XXL magazine earlier this year that they cut from the issue and didn't put out. Stupid choice.

I'm not a material person. there are much richer things to care about in life then money. I don't feel the need to keep a flashy image to impress others; go listen to Black Flag or Lace Up and maybe one day you'll be comfortable with just being yourselves., our first day of recording this 2nd album we made a song about the darker side of things in my life (which I know is the complete opposite of what the label wants from these sessions) so I didn't know how everyone was feeling about it, but then I walked into the studio the next morning and @iamjimjonsin gave me this...what an awesome gift, not just because of what it is, but because of why it was given to me: me, Jim, and the rest of the guys in the studio that day did what we believed, and that takes balls in this business. I guess we'll see what happens with it this upcoming year..., Day 3. Album #2., In the building, bleed for who you love. bleed for what you love., Fan Friday: this is the background of my phone...it's an EST tattoo made up of all the lyrics from "Lead You On"...music is religion to some people.

Pic was by Jonathan Mannion too: he did the Jay Z "Blueprint" cover amongst many other classics., All the fans had happy tears during the album release signing one year ago today. It was so surreal to see such an underground artist actually get a record deal and put an album out in stores, I remember how crazy I felt that day doing a signing in the same best buy I had been kicked out of back in the day lol. Crazy. Started as a dream., No "MGK" or "Machine Gun Kelly" text on the cover, no fancy picture of my face, just a mosaic of fan's "lace up" tattoos.

Real muthafucka. #laceup, Lace Up album anniversary biiiiitch!!!! #Oct9th, Just read the iTunes Editor's Note about Lace Up for the first time - so fuckin awesome, it's amazing to see how highly touted the EST fans are by journalists too., That verse from "What I Do" though...fuck!

You don't have to like me as a person, but I will not leave the stage until you respect me as an artist. I am so grateful to our EST fans for showing up and repping us hard as fuck in the crowd. Raise your flags., I haven't been that nervous before a show in a long time. So much shit was on my fucking mind, I hope I cleared it all out of my brain with the performance and I hope I introduced everyone who wasnt familiar with MGK to the movement the right way.

I just wanted an escape. That still holds true to this day. I may not own a car or a house, I may not be loved by journalists, critics, or the mainstream in general but what I do have is the people and that to me is work more then any platinum plaque, magazine cover, or top 10 MC list. And if you want proof direct you attention to my hand and see the muthafuckin Woodie of the Year (imagine what how much of a jackass I would've felt like if I wrote all this and didn't end up winning lol thank God I don't have to find out) To my fans: you're crazy, relentless, misunderstood and I love you for it, I'm honored to have you by my side.

We woke up one day on Warped tour and decided to shoot the video to it with no words, just emotions., i couldn't have written a more accurate intro to my album then "Save Me"...i get chills performing it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiiQVPRC6Jc, You should've seen people's faces in the cars that I was doing this in front of lmao >> http://t.co/9CYgWDbUj0, Lace Up Tour 2013: http://youtu.be/AsMSb_6yt5s, What I need a shirt fo, The thirst is real...ps, that's not her lol, if yall are hungry, here's a video i made of me cooking cheese eggs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GigKh8jsO5I, The night I wrote the chorus for D3MONS (off the Lace Up album) was an experience I'd love to share with y'all eventually. I wasn't writing a song when I transcribed the words "please God tell these demons stop fucking with me", that was a real cry for help. Its always interesting to think back on where I wrote certain songs and why I wrote them, maybe I can share the stories with you someday, Long plane ride home. I'll think about all you fans when I say my prayers, without you I'd be half a man. Stay radiant amongst darkness., "Champions"  download now available: http://www.mgklaceup.com/web/mgk-2/-/machine-gun-kelly-champions-ft-puff-daddy, now the Shaker grad boy signed to the Bad Boy, but i aint gettin cheesecake nope this aint Making of the Band homeboy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GigKh8jsO5I, 100,000 in one day and this is just a preview for the mixtape...CHAMPIONS!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GigKh8jsO5I, i really dislike when i do something musically and someone comments "this is not who MGK is". really? you lived with me my whole life? you know me personally? you know the demons i fought and the shit i've overcome? you know whats even crazier...is when another grown man calls you a sellout because you stop dressing like a bum. when your in the hood, your goal is: get out. when your broke, your goal is: get money. WHO WANTS TO STAY A BUM?? cuz if thats the case then everyone who has a job is a "sellout", and everyone who's sitting on their ass doing nothing is "real" i worked too many minimum wage jobs to ever think that that lifestyle is "cool". and honestly, i don't need some little 13 year old suburban white boys telling me how to keep shit "real". my music has been consistent since day 1. its the exact same formula on every project i release. idiots. smh. there is a difference between selling out and becoming successful. be inspired by our success, fans know we've been slept on long enough. meeting Jay Z inspired me to be a boss, he gives his community something to strive to be like. i try and do the same for yall. enough said., I'll drop the mp3 to "Champions" with me and @iamdiddy tomorrow!!

Tonight's gonna be fun, i just walked around my room with my hood up holding a remote lip-syncing every word to Eminem's "Losing Yourself" and i realized something. i realized how crazy it is to have someone like that to be a fan of. someone you can feel like you KNOW without even meeting them. someone that can make another GROWN ASS PERSON stand up and run around the room singing the lyrics to because you feel them that much! so to all the boys and girls out there: don't lose sight of how awesome it is to be a fan. Music keeps blood flowing in peoples veins. i felt like a teenager just then lol but fuck it, when my family wasnt around for me music like his kept me going. anyways, have a good day! p.s. don't let people tell you 'no' in life, trust me...it works. #laceup, Checking in with The Week in Jams to show them how to throw a real Super Bowl Party.

LTFU, I will not be in Albany, NY this weekend. New Tour Dates in Florida, Los Angeles, Minnesota, and Toronto ---> http://mgklaceup.com, EST: Everyone Stands Together, like father like daughter. we out hereeeeeeeeee ltfu, getting to spend the day with my daughter, just took this vid 5 minutes ago and cant stop smiling :), Oh shit just found out that "Invincible" is gonna be the theme song for WWE WrestleMania this year. ppl getting beat up to my shit = smiles, I wish people could know the real situation to things but Dub just gave me some of the best advice: the real fans will always be ur real fans, STATEMENT: the people that were with me from the beginning are here with me now. those are the people i will die with and die for. I just read a status that did so much injustice to how i am as a person i feel like i have to make that clear. i hate when people act like i owe them shit. I owe Slim, i owe Dub, i owe Ashleigh, I owe Xplosive, I owe Dre, I owe Irv, i owe Spordy, I owe the fans who sat in front of their phones and computers for 8 hours just voting so we could be number 1 at whatever the competition is, I owe the fans who take pride in the movement and hold their chin high when the outsiders look at us and laugh cuz they dont understand it, I owe the kid who went and got 'Lace Up' tattoo'd on their body because inside their heart they know the moment they put on their headphones and hear my music its an escape from this fucked up world for 3 minutes, I owe them. I dont owe a mother fucker looking for a handout because we've hung out through mutual acquaintances a couple times, a mother fucker who only put in a SMIDGEON of work compared to the blood, sweat, and tears others have dripped for this, a MAN who acts more like a bitch because they publicly blame another MAN for his own misfortunes when they've never even been through ANYthing in life together. Gossip is bullshit, and if you as a fan ever believe any of these rumors or this banter about me then smarten up. I'm a regular kid just like yall, living in a normal house, in a normal city, i just have an irregular job. The type of person i am now is the same person as i was when i was 17, only difference is that no one was feeding people lies about me back then. why? because people didn't want anything from me when i was mopping some dirty ass floor in my work uniform with a name tag back then. You wanna really question where my loyalty stands? Look at any and every video i've ever released, the crew you see in there are the ones still with me now. The manager i had before the deal? still manages me now. The city that was responsible for turning me from a boy into a man the way my father couldnt, the city where the sun shines 5 days out of the year, the place the public labeled as the 'mistake on the lake' but to me the greatest city in the world? I still live there now. The message, "Lace Up", the movement that EVERY label tried to steer me away from because it went against the grain of everything the industry stands for? You can see that same message flashing across the screen at the beginning of my first official music video when you see it NUMBER 1 on the countdown (because of yall of course) and the same message one of the biggest names in the industry (Diddy) now shouts because he understands it. Dont ever question who I am as a person, or ever think that my personal life is one to blog or gossip about, there are plenty of people who subject themselves to that in this industry, not me, I'm not here for fame, i'm here to save people with music like my inspirations saved me. EST FOR LIFE. LACE THE FUCK UP. And when i say those words, i mean them., ahh shit...Wild Boy remix recently added to my iPod!!!! i'll release this next week. mondayish? awesome, the newest member in the EST family; say hello to Cody the Iguana. LTFU!!, for the real fans, those who inspired me to truly love the meaning and embrace the pain behind this song, LACE UP!!, Lacing Up Michigan this Weekend!!!
