Deep reddish purple with aromas of bright berry/cherry fruit. Like swallowing a whole bowl of mixed ripe berries at once. Big body yet very balanced with luscious layers of raspberry, cherry, and cocoa flavors. Just a hint of baking spice at the end brings it all together. Pairs well with grilled meats such as beef and pork, smoked ham, and even pizza with meat toppings. Incredibly fun to drink!

The 2010 Patriota is a blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Bonarda aged for 12 months in French and American oak. A glass-coating opaque purple color, it sports an enticing nose of Asian spices, incense, lavender, plum, and blueberry. In the glass it opens to reveal a ripe, plush, savory wine with no hard edges. Drink this well-balanced, lengthy wine over the next 5-6 years. It is also an outstanding value.

91 Points
The Wine Advocate
While bonarda (60 percent of the blend) packs this with ripe red fruit, malbec adds the tension of acidity and enough firmness to match butifarra or other sausages, Need Plans for the New Year? Celebrate at Tango!
