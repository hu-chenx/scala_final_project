This country is nothing without you all., With all the ruckus about #starbucks and the red cups. I thought I would give you my 2 cents. Lets keep Christ & #santa in #christmas. While we're at it, I don't mind wishing someone a happy #hanukkah or a blessed ramadan.  And if someone doesnt worship at all then we can respect that also. 

Why not keep the spirit of Christmas and any holiday season intact. After all this is America and we can celebrate any holiday any way we like. If we lose this then what do we have left? We will become a culture like animals and zombies with no feelings to celebrate anything. Imagine Halloween without images of pumpkins and witches and ghosts. You get the idea. 

And one last point. The Christmas holiday brings so many blessings to a lot of retail establishments world wide (starbucks included). Without this holiday so many retailers wouldn't survive the rest of the year. Whether you celebrate the birth of Christ or not, at least respect the blessings that this holiday brings to so many.

In ending, we at Crush will keep saying merry christmas, happy hanukkah or whatever else our customers celebrate. And if they don't celebrate anything that's fine too. Just don't rain on our parade., Out the door, Want some wings with that pizza?

Native to Peru and Ecuador, a plant which produced yellow or red fruit (later called tomatoes) was introduced to Europe in the early 1500s. Brought back by Conquistadors to Spain, the tomato was thought to be poisonous and was viewed with suspicion. It wasn't until the late 1600s that Europeans began to eat the tomato.
