Mike Ragogna: Sir, with your new album Lang Lang In Paris, you are a bit subversive. How I mean that is in the West, Chopin compositions are traditionally performed very lightly and meditative with Tchaikovsky are bombastic. However, you seemed to have flipped the approaches. Tell me what your philosophy was when you approached the album.

Lang Lang: I had planned this recital for the whole year. I love Tchaikovsky's Seasons. I did it when I was a kid, "May," "June" and "October," those very famous pieces. It's actually very nice to do all twelve together. It really shows the change of the seasons, from January to February, February to March and all this. There are very subtle, very delicate changes between each month. Then I saw the Chopin Scherzo, two years ago I did Chopin's Ballade so I thought this is a continuation of bringing more of Chopin's major pieces into the continuity. Maybe every two years, maybe every three years, I just want to maybe one day complete the Chopin circle.

At the end of the month, I'll pick my favorite photos and give out 5 autographed deluxe album packs!, Another post on Chopin (for those who missed my earlier posts, my new CD is Chopin so I‚Äôve been thinking about him a lot and wanted to share some of these thoughts)! He‚Äôs one of the best-balanced composers in Romantic music for sure. During the Romantic period a lot of people tried to do incredible things like Liszt and Schumann and they didn‚Äôt want to be balanced, they thrived on the craziness of the Romantic period, those incredible contrasts, breaking through barriers. 

Chopin is like someone who comes and says, ‚ÄúI love the new time but I want to go my own way and not try to break anything.‚Äù And you can feel the legato in his music, the singing technique brought to the piano. That‚Äôs one major breakthrough he did make, he made the piano like opera. Before him, Mozart had made the piano sing, but Chopin did that for the Romantic period and it feels natural with Chopin. Why? Because he really knows the reasons to be poetic, and that‚Äôs why they call him the poet of the piano. And accompanying singers has actually helped me to understand and play Chopin. I understand that you have to think about the story, and how he tells it., Tickets still available!, Tonight on PBS, I'll be appearing on the Tavis Smiley show to talk about my new Chopin album.

But with this great composer there‚Äôs always more to say (and of course he‚Äôs on my mind a lo
t with my new album, which is all Chopin)‚Ä¶
 
I was saying that Chopin is always so beautiful it can be a challenge to bring out the complex emotions. I‚Äôve tried different ways. Sometimes I‚Äôve tried playing it like Beethoven or Shumann but it doesn‚Äôt work with Chopin. Some of Schumann‚Äôs work has an incredible craziness of imagination and you can bring out these strange characters and all those magical pedals, you can kind of hear the sound behind your ears! But when I‚Äôve played Chopin this very characterful approach doesn‚Äôt feel right, it just adds extra tension to his music.
 
Early Scriabin is basically like Chopin, very beautiful, and then later he developed to a different route, much more spiritual. But playing Chopin like the mature Scriabin is not going to work either.

I have the greatest respect for her, the organization, and the talented competitors in this year's competition! http://www.leedspiano.com/, Prokofiev‚Äôs Piano Concerto number 3, in Paris! I thought it might be fun to start sharing some thoughts about the music with my friends and fans, and Prokofiev is a good place to start. He is a very percussive composer, and he gives the pianist an extremely percussive technique, but one should never just bang away at the keys! Because at the same time he can be very dark and very lyrical. Compared to Rachmaninov, Prokofiev can be darker in the musical lines, but still there is so much passion there ‚Äì when you play it, it can feel almost like your heart comes out from the piano. It‚Äôs that powerful. 

And some moments are blackly humorous. It‚Äôs a strange kind of humour, as with the funny accent he has the woodwind solo adopt at the opening of the second movement. That kind of playing with character is really contemporary in some ways. But I really like the way he combines contemporary chord structures into the romantic themes ‚Äì in some senses, the kind of thing Chopin did in his era, merging romantic feelings into classical form, Prokofiev did in his! And so, when I play Prokofiev, it‚Äôs never just another work. You always feel you‚Äôre in the hands of a master who changed music., With Jorg Widmann and Paavo Jarvi after the concerts in Frankfurt.

What do you think?, "It's become rather fashionable to sniff at the achievements of Lang Lang, but he is the most communicative pianist of his generation, with a huge following in the east, and for any open-minded listener there is seriously good piano playing in this fine recital from Vienna. He is intense and focused in the "Appassionata", sharp and lively in Beethoven's early C major sonata. His Alb√©niz is thrillingly colourful, his Prokofiev vivid and pungent. Then he relaxes into his Chopin encores; perhaps he is indulgent, but the technical command is peerless and the emotional warmth envelops us. He is surely the Horowitz of our generation." - The Guardian, Millions worldwide are standing up and taking action against poverty. Are you?
