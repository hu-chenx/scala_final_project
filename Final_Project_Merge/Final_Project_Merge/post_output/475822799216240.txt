Robinson and Yogi Berra, two of the game‚Äôs fiercest competitors, met one last time in the 1956 World Series. Game 7 at Ebbets Field ended with Robinson swinging at a third strike that got away from Berra, who threw to first baseman Moose Skowron for the final out ‚Äî Robinson‚Äôs final appearance in a major league uniform (photo courtesy New York Daily News).
