As always the real estate market is pretty busy - this week being no exception. Here's a home I photographed on 13 Saddle Lane in Hanover a few days ago for Norwell Realtor Paul Jevne of Coldwell Banker in Norwell. At a little over $1 million, this home is top quality. A beautiful home on a quiet cul-de-sac. Here are a few photos from the mornings photo session.

Have a nice Easter everyone!

Does anyone remember Ellis Brett Pond in Brockton?

So I was visiting Brockton yesterday, when I decided to take a peek at the Ellis Brett public beach area in D.W. Field Park. This used to be a thriving fun place during the summers of the 1960's.

Looks like someone failed to do an environmental impact study of what runoff from the Westgate Mall would have on the area - Anyway, the entire area became polluted.

This photo is from 400 feet up with my drone. All that's left of Ellis Brett is the cement foundation (lower center) of where the diving board once was. The semi circle of trees to the left of the cement is where the beach once was. Out beyond the diving area was once all open clean water. The arrow is pointing to where I'm standing.

My last time here...

I remember walking Anna Mae Coe and her sister home from here with my friend Joe Venuti in the early 60's to her home on North Montello Street in Brockton.

Nature always finds a way to retake...

http://www.tomsheehanphotography.com/#!/index/G000096gzuqHpWW4, Hi everyone!

Having a little fun flying around my property late this afternoon with my Phantom 3 Pro drone at 400 feet. My home can be seen in the upper left of the photo. 

Rather than having folks guess where I'm standing, I just drew a little arrow near the middle of the screen.

Went into Boston on Friday on the commuter boat from Hingham to check out the progress of the Greenway from a few years ago. What a difference from the days of large green iron supports when the southern artery was rumbling overhead. The architects and builders did an amazing job in the transformation from what this area once was. 

I photographed a few photos from the Greenway around the Rowes Wharf area. The last photo from the boat heading back to Hingham is of the supports of the now defunct Long Island Bridge, at which the commuter boat once traveled under on its daily run.

Have a nice week everyone. Thank you for stopping by - and as always, thank you for the page likes. I appreciate it.

Have a great week everyone! GO PATS!!! :), Hi everyone!

I get to photograph some very nice homes - Like this one seen here that is new construction in Norwell. 

Photographing new home construction can often be more challenging than photographing a home containing furniture. 

In the home with existing furniture, the visual is there for a prospective buyers eyes to view the home in a lived in environment. Where as with new construction, the visual has to be created in the final image by photographing rooms at more abstract angles to easier allow the eye/mind communication of the viewer to visualize and create what a room might be like when lived in.

Have a great weekend everyone! Stay warm!

GO PATS!!!

Even the boathouse along the North River within the Norris Reservation in Norwell is showing the holiday spirit. The swag above the door caught my eye the other day when I was walking along the trail.

Who would think that a few pine & holly branches, and a simple ribbon could add so much character to a doorway that normally wouldn't have much attention paid to it. It's nice seeing this.

Have a nice week everyone!

A Disney movie is being filmed around our area for the next couple of days. The movie crew is filming scenes at the Cushing Center in Norwell center.

The movie - The Finest Hours stars Chris Pine, Casey Afflick, Holiday Grainger. It's based on t a true story of a Coast Guard rescue off of Cape Cod in 1952.

I can't believe what goes into a movie, and all of the people in the background that make it all happen. All the way from the old cars, to the fake snow on trees, roofs, and around buildings, to wind machines. Pretty cool.

It was another nice evening last night for a senior photo session. This night I worked with with a Marshfield senior and her mom. We had a nice time. We started our portrait session at their dock along the North River, before heading over to another spot just downstream a ways. Nice night - Nice smiles - and very little wind. Doesn't get much better.

Here are a few images from last night.

Another nice evening for senior portraits - I had the pleasure of working with a high school senior from Weymouth last night. Both mom and daughter were great to work with.

The wind died down for us, but boy, it's been a windy summer for senior portraits. I can't remember a summer with as many gusty/ breezy evenings as this one. I'm sure many senior photographer's would agree with me.

Here are a few photos from last night.

Between photographing weddings, and photographing high school seniors, it's been a very busy summer for me - but I'm not complaining.

I had a very nice senior photo session at Sandy Beach in Cohasset over the weekend. Mom and daughter were great to work with.

ATTENTION SENIORS & MOMS...

Due to the increased volume of high school senior portraits. I'm going to start to offer early morning senior portrait sessions. 

To capture the early morning light, we would have to start photographing around 7AM. We still have 2-3 weeks before school resumes, so this early morning slot may be a good chance to get your senior yearbook photos taken care of.

If this interest's anyone - just call me at the number below, or contact me through my website. My email can be found throughout the site.

Thanks!

http://tomsheehanphotography.com/GalleryMain.asp?GalleryID=58505&AKey=5L2E5P9C, Hi everyone!

Hope you're all enjoying the nice weather.

It's been a busy time lately. High school senior yearbook pictures are in full swing.

I had the pleasure of working with a mom from Weymouth, and her twin daughters the last few nights. We battled some high winds one night, forcing us to call a halt to one photo session, continuing again with it last night - but in the end, everything worked out well for us. I have the pleasure of meeting and working with some of the nicest people.

Have a nice weekend everyone! :) Thanks for always dropping by. I appreciate it.

Want to know why many of you are not seeing posts in your news feed from Tom Sheehan Photography?

Many of you have messaged that you have not heard from me lately. I’m here quite often. I post on a regular basis. So what is the problem? Why are you not seeing anything from me on a regular basis?

Here's one reason: EVERYDAY Facebook changes your settings in your news feed automatically. No matter how many times you change it to Recent Stories so you get posts from all your favorite pages, they reset it back to Top Stories so you don't.

So you need to go to the left side of your timeline.... right next to where it says News Feed. And you will see it. Facebook has probably changed your settings from Most Recent Stories to Top stories. So set it back to MOST RECENT and you will see all the posts you missed over the last few days come up.

Top stories means Facebook picks only what THEY feel is news worthy for you based on how much interaction comes in on a post. (such as Cat Pages) However Recent Stories will show everything that has posted recently. It’s not just happening to my page – It’s happening to many local area pages.

So folks...you need to go right now and change your settings - and make it a habit to change them every day if you want to continue to control what you see and not what Facebook wants to put out. If you do this and if you interact with me here on a regular basis by commenting, liking and sharing posts, it will keep this page going strong in your news feed.

Thanks ~ Tom

My Mamiya RB67

A camera that was way ahead of the others...

This was an amazing camera in its day. The perfect wedding camera. 6x7 format to give you perfect 8x10's. It had a revolving back, to give you vertical or horizontals without having to turn the camera. You could crop right in the camera eliminating the need for any color lab crop guide, like the guy's shooting square negs using twin lens reflex cameras had to do. The eye level view finder gave you perfect head on shots. It also had a 1:1 ratio - perfect for ring shots. The only drawback, is that it was very heavy. A small sacrifice for the quality it gave. 

This camera shot so many weddings until it's retirement in the late 90's.

Mom fox (seen here) had five young cubs. I had the pleasure of spending 5 weeks photographing Mom and her cubs as they went about their daily routine. It was an experience witnessing the love and dedication this female fox had for her young cubs. Though she was aware of my presence, she totally accepted my being there photographing her and her young.
