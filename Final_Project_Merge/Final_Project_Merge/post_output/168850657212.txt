Nix's GALLOP CHEESEBURGER with Cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, onions, pickles, & special sauce sounds good to us! See you soon, Do you know the story behind the Curse of Nix's Mate?? 

The legend associated with Nix's Mate states that Captain Nix was killed at sea by his mate, William Fly. Officials brought Pirate Chief William Fly to Boston where he was executed. Fly was hung in irons, on Nix's Mate, over the graves of his confederates; and here his bones shook and rattled in the sea-air for many months, as a grim warning to all not to turn to piracy. He protested his innocence until the end, and stated that the place that witnessed his judicial murder would be washed away by the angry sea and this would be proof of his innocence. Within a century, the high cliffs of Nix's Mate eroded away.  Today's 200 square foot rock is all that remains. Nix‚Äôs Mate is entirely hidden at high tide. 

Did all the quarrying of slate and ballast rock in the 1600's and 1700's reduce the island to its current size? Or did the pirate's curse come to pass? Perhaps the only way to know is to sail out to Nix's Mate after sunset on a calm night‚Ä¶to see if the laughter of William Fly and his mates can be heard in the wind., Beautiful Monday morning in the Financial District!
