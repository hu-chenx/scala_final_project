Classic Album Sundays Boston are getting onto the Bowie action this month! Often hailed as one of the albums that signaled the official end of the 60’s (along with Roxy Music’s eponymous debut), “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars” is where rock/pop meets the theater and is widely considered to be Bowie’s finest masterpiece. Although it wasn’t written as a concept album, “The Rise and Fall…” introduces (and destroys) one of rock’s most notable characters, Ziggy Stardust, who to this day remains rock mythology’s greatest icon. The album was also responsible for making David Bowie an international superstar.

After experiencing the heady nightlife of downtown New York City’s underground dance clubs, New Order were inspired to bring the musical elements of the dance floor into their sound on their second album “Power Corruption and Lies”.

Tune out of your daily routine and tune in to this new monthly music-listening experience.
These days, no one is ever at a loss for music listening opportunities. Most of us have a plethora of sources to choose from: a Spotify account, that slightly annoying (but well-meaning) friend who’s constantly posting new music via Youtube videos on your wall, and an impressive iTunes library. Even so, when was the last time you sat down and listened to an album in its entirety instead of mindlessly shuffling through playlists during your daily commute? Can you even remember?

Classic Album Sundays aims to change that by encouraging music lovers to tune out of their daily routine and allocate time to tune in. The event has quickly risen in popularity over the last few years after its creation in London by Colleen “Cosmo” Murphy—who happens to be a DJ and a Massachusetts native—after she and her husband began having friends over to their apartment to listen to albums. It was here that Murphy recognized potential for a unique, collective music listening experience in a world where music listening has been downsized to an almost alienating degree. It wasn’t just any old listening either, but one done completely on vinyl. It’s an audiophile’s hi-fi dream, and this weekend, it debuts in Boston.

The premise is simple: every month a classic album is chosen by Murphy and her team, ranging from artists like Miles Davis, Led Zeppelin, Brian Eno, Bob Dylan, and others. Then, on a Sunday, participants gather and dedicate a night to that album—not just the music itself but the entire picture. Before the needle’s lowered onto the record, the context and cultural importance of the album are discussed in depth amongst the group. Afterward, phones are turned off, lights are dimmed, and conversations are silenced as the crackling, detailed first notes of the album float out across the room. For the next hour or so, listeners are fully and completely swept up in a true musical experience, one that proves to be just as physical as it is mental.

Much like a yoga practice, many find the experience to be therapeutic, meditative, and in some cases, even eye-opening. Not only does the event challenge the way we’ve grown accustomed to listening to music, but it unveils how music should actually be experienced: an immersion without distractions, one that allows for intricacies as well as the grander picture of an album.

After taking Classic Album Sundays global and expanding to cities like Glasgow, Edinburgh, and New York, Murphy’s decided to return to Boston and bring her project with her. This Sunday, listeners are invited for the unveiling of CAS at Meadhall. Going forward, they will take place on the first Sunday of every month.

Why should Sunday nights merely be a precursor to the ever-dreaded Monday? Stop by, order a drink, and raise your glass to what’s sure to be an unforgettable music experience.

This weekend’s event centers around the album Remain in Light by Talking Heads. Tickets are $10 and can be purchased online on eventbrite or at the door but tickets are limited - only 9 tickets remain.  Sunday, April 7, 5-8 p.m., Meadhall, 4 Cambridge Center, Cambridge., Meadhall & Classic Album Sundays presents Talking Heads "Remain in Light" @Meadhall
Sunday, April 7, 2013 from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM
Tickets on sale on Eventbrite. 

"Remain in Light" saw the band melding African polyrhythms, music-making methodologies and mythologies, with their own distinctive funk-rock. They attempted to collaborate more as a band, jamming long instrumental sections which producer Brian Eno would then loop and use to further spur the creative process. The album is also a great time capsule of downtown New York City circa 1980 uniting the dance music, new wave, hip hop and experimental music scenes.
Join us at 5 pm to listen to music that either inspired or was relevant to this LP such as Fela Kuti, Funkadelic, Sly & Robbie and Brian Eno. Order some food and grab a beer from Meadhall's extensive 100 tap beer selection.

Doors close at 6:45 for this event and at 7:00 pm CAS founder Colleen 'Cosmo' Murphy relays the story behind the album. Then the lights go down, the volume goes up and we play the album from beginning to end on vinyl on our audiophile hi-fi which includes a VPI Traveler Turntable with a Grado Gold 1 Cartridge, VPI Phono Stage, Classe CP-800 Preamp, Classe CT-2300 Power Amplifier and Bowers & Wilkins 802 Diamond Loudspeakers.  No cell phones, no talking - just crystal clear classic vinyl., There's a fairly unbelievable event at Meadhall in Cambridge this Weds., Dec. 19 that features 12 craft breweries raising money for Toys for Tots.

Meadhall has given all 110 draft lines (plus two casks) to 12 brewers for an event called the "12 Brewers of Christmas". The event begins at 7 p.m., and the bar is asking for a donation of at least $10 or a toy of equal value (again 100% given to Toys for Tots) as an entrance fee.

A variety of silent auction items ranging from rare bottled beer to collections of wearables from each brewery to donations from local industry members will be available with all proceeds from the auctions donated to Toys for Tots. To cap it off, 10 extremely rare, cellared or "one-time only" releases from the breweries (a barrel-aged sour from Troegs, Citra Single Hop from Sierra, brewery only release from Allagash, etc.) will also be available on the mezzanine level.

The draft lineup is beyond ridiculous. Meadhall has already begun tapping a keg per day leading up to the event, but here's the full list of brewers and beers:
