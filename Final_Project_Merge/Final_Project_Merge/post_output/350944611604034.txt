“I was going back and forth about putting ES on here because I know that everyone already has this place in mind. There’s no one in the industry here in Boston that doesn’t have an ES story up their sleeve or a page out of their playbook in their back pocket. This place has single-handedly influenced damn near every person in the restaurant/bar industry in a positive way. It’s honestly a home away from home: where I go for last call, for wine night, with my parents, for lunch, to see friends. It’s the first spot I ever stepped foot into when I first came to Boston, and it’s the spot I’m continuously impressed by. It is literally the standard—oh wait, I get it now.

"Touché!" You say, as you take your seat at the bar (you were already out the door an hour ago) and order the Frenchified version of the Negroni — The Lucien Gaudin. "The Champ is here."

Created by the French fencing world champion himself after his first Olympic gold medal in Prohibition-era 1924,* the #LucianGaudin allows for adjustable sweetness and an overall citrus flavor:

Letherbee Gin
Combier
Campari
Dry Vermouth
Lemon Oil

*this is our slightly Romanticized version of the cocktail's history. 

Read more about it here:
"The Lucien Gaudin Cocktail is a tribute to the skill and success of one of France’s national fencing champions. He first made his name in the very early twentieth century, went on to become European and world champion, then won two gold medals in the 1924 Olympics, and two more in 1928. A couple more silver medals made him one of the most decorated French medalists in the history of the Olympics.

The drink’s first maker is unknown, but it seems likely the Lucien Gaudin cocktail appeared while Gaudin was at the height of his fame and fencing prowess, in the late days of the Prohibition era—perhaps as early as 1928, while Gaudin would have been a hot item in the sporting news." http://cold-glass.com/2014/12/05/the-lucien-gaudin-cocktail/, Class up your Friday for a change (kidding... :/) with "The Martinez" — The Darth Vader to the Martini, an equally elegant and classic drink, and the 2nd feature in our #GINseries:

Ransom Spirits Old Tom Gin
Sweet Vermouth
Maraschino Liqueur
Dash of Bitter Truth Jerry Thomas Decanter Bitters
Lemon Oil Garnish

"...we can safely assume that the Martini and the Martinez emerged at about the same time. More specifically, they were developed in the late 1860s and into the 1870s, when vermouth became a common ingredient in American cocktails. 

There will always be room for debate on the origins of these cocktails. According to historian David Wondrich, theories surrounding the Martini/Martinez fall into two camps: the “martinez” group claims the drink(s) were invented in or near San Francisco, while the “Martine/Martini” theories call New York the home of the Martini. Wondrich has ruled out Jerry Thomas, the famed bartender of the late 1800s, as the inventor of the Martinez, noting that it appeared two years after his death in a later 1887 edition of his Bar-tenders Guide. The Martinez first appears, says Wondrich, in O.H. Byron’s 1884 Modern Bartender’s Guide, though without any mention of its origins. The Martinez may very well have emerged in the town of Martinez in California, spreading rapidly from bartender to bartender in the booming 1860s-70s San Francisco bar scene.

The name, however, remains a mystery." Source: http://temperedspirits.com/2011/07/02/examined-the-martinez/, The perfect pour = #seriousbusiness.

Plymouth Gin
Dry vermouth

"As to the precise origins of this potent little almagoozlum -- a cross between the French 75 and the Honey Bee -- we cannot say. It simply turns up, as if by spontaneous generation, in our 1949 Handbook for Hosts. 

The name, at least, isn't much of a riddle: Way back when, airmail was the last word in getting something from point A to point B. And in fact, this one'll do just that to you, but quick. So quick that, if we were inclined to take such liberties, we'd rename it the 'Email.' http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3760/air-mail-drink-recipe/, Want a drink that will please ALL of your senses?

The recipe supposedly comes from the (now closed) Queen’s Park hotel in Trinidad. The drink is so refreshing and delicious that in 1946 one Trader Vic declared the Queen’s Park Swizzle to be “the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today.", Thanks Frederic Yarm AKA Cocktail Virgin Slut for this feature on the man, the myth, the legend... Matthew Schrage: http://bit.ly/1MhmxCq #schrageagaintsthemachine 

"For the fifth installment of the Boston Cocktail Allstars, I am paying tribute to a gentleman that falls somewhere between amaro master and social dadaist, namely Matthew Schrage...", It’s Friday, time to shake it up and ask "Tyler" for a Ramos Gin Fizz — the classic New Orleans brunch cocktail, but we use Fords Gin.

Invented in the 1880s by Henry C. Ramos, in his bar at Meyer's Restaurant, this is one of New Orleans' most famous drinks. The secret of its flavor and texture is orange flower water and egg whites.

"The earliest story that mentions one of the Southside variants is set at the Southside Sportsmen’s Club in Long Island during the 1890s when Fizz’s were at the peak of their popularity. Accordingly, it was the Southside Fizz that was known to have been drunk here, and the sweet, refreshing minty flavour that it produces would have been the perfect antidote following a game of sport. Craddock’s cocktail guide does indeed write up the Southside Fizz, there is no mention of leaving out the soda. This appears to suggest therefore that the Southside Fizz was the original of its repertoire." via Gin Foundry, To the untrained ear it may sound like howling hooks and power chords, but for those of you who can still turn up a Taking Back Sunday or Brand New album and sing every word, for those who still glorify the anthems of parking lots and the occasional mosh pit, and those who still sympathize with the self-imposed angst and cynicism that shaped our more formative years, we give you, #EmoNight this Wednesday: https://www.facebook.com/events/617666791709464/

....inside B&M asking for Rittenhouse Rye. 

(and by old man we mean everyone), “Drinking is an emotional thing. It joggles you out of the standardism of everyday life, out of everything being the same. It yanks you out of your body and your mind and throws you against the wall. I have the feeling that drinking is a form of suicide where you're allowed to return to life and begin all over the next day." 

— Charles Bukowski, Heads up — we're closed tonight!, It may be gross out this week ....

It is concocted of cracked ice, Scotch whisky, the juice of a lime and a bottle of ginger ale. The New Yorker invited Edward Green, of Texas, son of Hetty Green, to sample it, remarking as the statesman from Texas tasted it: 'That's the newest drink out.'

'Probably it is in New York,' said Green, 'but they have been using it in Texas for 30 years. We used to call it The Scotch Lassie. What do you call it?' 'A Mamie Taylor,' said the New Yorker."

The LP IPL, or Long Play India Pale Lager, was built to extend the hoppy good times, when more than one is expected, and tongue fatiguing bitterness is not welcome.

Sounds awesome, and we’re celebrating with awesome sounds from our industry’s finest., null, Preparing the strawberry infused Del Maguey Crema de Mezcal for our take on Mike Ryan's "Speaking in Tongues" cocktail. (Sable Kitchen & Bar, Chicago)

http://firebrandsaints.com/, Here at the temple we like to call Brick & Mortar we are know to invoke the "Ritual of the Spirits" when the occasion calls for it. The Gods of the Goblet passed down these guidelines for proper practice of the Ritual....

"The Ritual of the Spirits 

1.0 - Determine what kind of Ritual of the Spirits you will be performing. It could be for love, divination,a thank you,etc.
1.1 - Do some research to determine which Spirits would be best for you and decide the name and function of the Spirits you will be invoking.
1.2 - Choose the best time of day to invoke the Spirits, usually sunset or another significant cosmic/personal event when the energies of the universe are strongest
1.3 - Bathe to rid yourself of any negative energies and dirt. Dress appropriately in clothing of pure fabric or perform your Ritual of the Spirits naked.
1.4 - Plan what you will say to invoke the Spirits. It should have personal significance. Reverently state what you want the Spirits to do once they are invoked. 
1.5 - Visualize the result of your Ritual of the Spirits coming to fruition. Upon completing the Ritual thank the Spirits for participating.
1.6 - Rinse and repeat. "

We found this Ritual inscribed on a tablet high on a mountain, then we chopped the mountain down with the edge of our hand.  Then we had a drink to kill the throbbing pain in the edge of our hand....CHURCH!, Hey friends, the amazing DJ Rabbit Ears will be emptying the pockets of his heart for you this Monday @ our Spin the Bottle throwdown.

@rawr_emma @FirebrandSaints, Hey friends, 

Your friendly neighborhood manager here at B&M, Miguel Blackmer-Hart, has been nominated for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 2013 Man of the Year award. The way a nominee is crowned Man/Woman of the Year is by raising the most money during their campaign, which ends on May 23rd. His mother Pinky is a blood cancer survivor who was given 6 months to live and thanks to her getting on an experimental trial for Gleevec she has been alive 13 years! 

So this cause is very near and dear to our hearts. It effects so many of us, please take the time to check out the link to the fundraising page . Pass it on to all your friends!! 

Thanks for your support, we hope to raise a ton of money for LLS to do blood cancer research and care. GO TEAM PINKY!!!!

Here is the link to the fundraising page. Pass it on to all your friends please!
