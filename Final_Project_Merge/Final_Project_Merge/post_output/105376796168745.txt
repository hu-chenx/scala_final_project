#OneNationOneTeam, Date: February 28, 2001
Location: Columbus, Ohio

The final round of qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup began in February, and after years of finding itself the visiting team at home against Mexico, U.S. Soccer tried a new approach, selecting Columbus Crew Stadium as the venue for this critical clash. With a partisan U.S. crowd enduring a temperature of 29 degrees at kickoff ‚Äì it was so cold the Mexican team refused to come out for warmups ‚Äì the United States was forced to make two substitutions in the first half, losing Brian McBride and team captain Claudio Reyna to injury. The team stuck together, and Josh Wolff and Earnie Stewart lit the lamp while Brad Friedel kept the clean sheet. The MNT had its win, and more importantly, a new place to call home.

Watch- http://ussoc.cr/1L4YiBp, Don't forget, the roster for USA v MEX will be announced on FOX tonight at the FOX COLLEGE FOOTBALL PRE-GAME show, beginning at 7 pm ET.
