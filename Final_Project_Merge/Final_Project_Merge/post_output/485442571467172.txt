CHER CANCELS UPCOMING ‘DRESSED TO KILL’ TOUR DATES
Doctors Advise Additional Rest to Ensure Full Recovery

With enormous regret, Cher has announced the cancellation of all remaining dates on her Dressed To Kill (D2K) concert tour.

Beginning in March, the multi-award-winning superstar completed 49 sold out concerts to unanimous rave reviews before taking a scheduled break in July.

Shortly before returning to the road in September, she was felled by an infection that affected her kidney function.

While her progress has been consistent, Cher’s doctors have advised her to take more time to ensure a complete and total recovery.

Commented Cher: “I am totally devastated. Nothing like this has ever happened to me.  I cannot apologize enough to all the fans who bought tickets.  I’m so proud of this show. It is my best ever. I sincerely hope that we can come back again next year and finish what we started.”

Cher is on the mend from her recent illness but her doctors have advised that her recovery will take longer than previously expected. As a result, the hugely successful D2K Tour which has already completed 49 remarkable shows will start back up in Lubbock Texas on November 9th. A new schedule of all upcoming D2K tour dates will be officially announced on CHER.COM next week which will include newly rescheduled dates for the postponed shows.

“The initial viral infection effected her kidneys which has delayed Cher’s recovery time. Cher’s doctors have advised her to extend her rest period and expect her to make a full recovery” commented her spokesperson.

Commented Cher: “I want to thank all my fans for their good wishes, patience and prayers. The doctors assure me that I will be totally well by November 9th and ready to perform my show. I’m truly sorry that I can’t get on the stage sooner. But, the good news is that I’m on the mend and feeling better every day. I can’t wait to see you all. I’ll be ‘Dressed to Kill’ in my unbelievable new Bob Mackie gowns and promise you an unforgettable night.”
