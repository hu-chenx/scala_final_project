List(Winter’s Landing would like to thank everyone for the enormous amount of support that the project has and continues to receive. Winter’s Landing remains one of the world's best and most original winter activation concepts. It will have a tremendous economic impact, enhance tourism and have a true cultural significance – all while engaging all segments of the community. It continues to be something that Boston desires and needs.

The City of Boston has opted to go another route to activate City Hall Plaza. Winter’s Landing respects the City of Boston’s decision and is excited to see the Plaza programmed regardless of who engineers the activity. There is a need for more public activation and the City's efforts are a good step forward. It has been a pleasure working with City officials throughout the process. 

While our team is disheartened to hear this news, it will continue to work to bring this fully conceptualized, fully privately funded and fully programmed activation to life. Winter’s Landing is actively seeking a host site for the entire installation and the 450 scheduled programs and events. All areas of Winter's Landing have been and are ready for launch.

Winter’s Landing encourages anyone that is interested in helping make Winter’s Landing a reality to please get in touch with our project team today. Please contact us directly via Facebook message or support@anthemevents.com.
