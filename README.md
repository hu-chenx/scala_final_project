# scala_final_project

The test3 file is our current eclipse project, the test_2_fb file in 
directory src/main/scala/neu/edu/scala is used to retrive data from 
facebook,and the reason why it is called test is it just represent
our current process, and test_fb file is used to extends the accesstoken,
because it will expire in few hours.

The final_project file currently contains tf-idf implementation under 
src/main/scala/neu/edu/scala directory.
